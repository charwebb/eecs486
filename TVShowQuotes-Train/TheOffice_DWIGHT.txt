Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-
Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert���s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there���s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person���s penis?
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it���s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]
Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it's handle] You sell a lot of these?
[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
[eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he���s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.
But as Jim and I discovered...  No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
What are some of your small business ideas?
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear]
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what���s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you���re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]
Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
Oh, great. He���s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don���t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So��� have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let���s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So���yes. I���d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What���s going on Nellie? Talk to me.
Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]
I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
You don���t need to repeat right now, when I���m saying it.
Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it���s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?
You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ���poisoned��� by Aunt Shirley.
No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
With today���s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it���s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don���t try planking. It���s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ���Specially with me around.
Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?
I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who���s the father of her child?
[looking into his coffee mug] What the hell?
I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]
No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.
Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]
Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
I will. I will. You need to calm down.
Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I���m gonna like it.
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
Oh my God, we have to be there.
[in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.
This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it���s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It���s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It���s for a disorder of the mind.
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley���s got way more body fat than they do.
Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn���t on the itinerary.
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]
Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
Oh my���! Oh d���! Oh, how did���? [gasps] Huhhhhh!
Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Pfft, ���Athlead���? Please. They���re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ���Stumpany,��� for ���Stupid Company.���
Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
[taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!
[snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp.
[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?
I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
Euughh��� Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present��� Hey.
[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
It was his birthday, just turned three. So���
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I���m sure he���d give a reference.
Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts?
Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
[sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
I don���t like him either. ��And yet I really like him.
You���ll always have the upper hand, when you���ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
David. Can I just do one thing while you���re making this announcement and then I���ll never, ever do it again?
I put everything back in the vending machine.
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!'
I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]
[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they���re out of the house.
Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.
[places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]
No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he���s slouching. Okay, can you���sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
[takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!
Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
[playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ���ahhmmm��� excuse me��� What?! Not now, I'm busy.
No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
... is there any news on the leads?
Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.
Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.
This is where I saw that deer last week.
Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.
That place doesn���t exist. It���s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You���re still at the 570 number?
Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out.
They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
It is the situation that we are in now.
Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?
The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren���t going to look back.
[Toby uses tester on wall as Erin marks wall with red tape X] Oh, god.
Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I���m eating Jims.
That is not a statue, that is a robot.
[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...
Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It���s called ���Schrute or Consequences.��� You���re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
[Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he���s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now.  She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor���s had stolen from him?
Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.
As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You���re gonna watch me right?
Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that���s what working at a paper company���s all about!
Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
So what kind of commissions you get up there?
While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
What makes you think you���d be an effective paper salesman?
It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow]
They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like���not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor���
Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
In your office? [in Michael's office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
Maybe over a beer after she���s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.
You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!
No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
[Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]
Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
Not true. And if they did, they couldn't because I'm password protected.
For five years I���ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it���s time for me to just let that thought go. It���s kind of painful, but it���s also freeing in a way. Now it���s all about my instincts.
Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]
What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
Wha���Yes. Your attention. Uh because��� No that is all. [walks out]
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
[enters main office, group claps] Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ���em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
[laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
[walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
I will trade you for the used candle.
[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV.'
Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check��� on that later today. This is my grandmother���s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother���s buttock bullet ring.
Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.
[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
I like where you're going with this. Continue.
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!'
Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.
Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before.
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
That���s really rude.  I don���t tell you hurricanes suck even though it���s true.
My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?
This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
I can���t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it���s your call.
Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.
I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?
Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?
Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
The perfect girl for me would be Konikotaka. She has the most amazing story. She was orphaned at age 10 when both her parents were assassinated, and she was taken in by a wealthy, but very cruel, businessman. So she practiced aikido in secret for years until she could avenge the death of her parents. She's also a survivor of monster rape.
Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]
This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.
So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good.
[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You'll be back.
Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now?  It's not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ��We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
You seem a little nervous. You shouldn't be.
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
[quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]
Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog. [runs with stroller]  Oh, no!  Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer [forcefully pushes stroller away toward uneven ground with junk strewn around, the stroller hits some junk, stays upright, and stops safely]
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.
Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no��� Freak, I need a favor.
[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]
Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
Okay, now here���s the plan. I���m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It���s gonna be fine. It���s gonna be fine. There���s plenty of Pyramids.
Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.' You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.
[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you���re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we���ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War���
Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
I can���t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.
Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]
Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
[raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]
Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
No, you're not because I spent hours on it.
Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah!  Aa-aaah! [throws it ahead of the car, it goes for a while and then is stopping]  It's a hardy stroller. [takes watermelon out of stroller, holds it up to show camera] Maybe it's safe!
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me.
Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
[phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he���s free anytime. Not a problem.
That���s very true. Get the hell outta here.
When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on]
Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
...because you are never going to see him again.
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?
Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...
We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
How do I become a manger at Sabre?
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.
Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they���re protecting America���s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day���s security codes. Something that���s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It���s not the KGB, but it���s a start.
Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.
Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous.
Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
No, don���t say it. You���re fired! You���re both fired!
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.
Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
[yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
Oh, come on. I���ve never heard of such a thing.
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.
So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we���ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
Michael, I would like to be the elf.
[yawns, ���Idiot��� is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
[shouts from another room] What did you do?
I heard you say ���well��� the first time.
Okay, I���m gonna need you to print it out.
[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
[kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!
I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.
Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
You haven���t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let���s go over membership. I���m going to need the first month���s and the last month���s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month���
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I���ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I���ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I���m doin��� great.
Aah! Actually, he���s right in front of us.
Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.
I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.
Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
Does he have access to their medical records?
And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
[bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
He said he would do the same for me.
So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
[bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.
Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot.
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]
Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]
I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
I have to do something to his eyes.
[sighs] Sixty - forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I'll drive.
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
I have to put you on with my boss.
[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
[into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
[falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
It���s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
You did not just say that! You don���t know Pam. She is really cool.
Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file]  'Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.' Juvie. 'According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor...'  Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You���re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark���s shoulder]
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.
[interrupting] ��� lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
OK, can we steer away from gay people?
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?
You���re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we���ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
No, no, no, no! You don���t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There���s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don���t have diplomatic relations.
Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
Are you really not going to punch him?
New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let���s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let���s go.
Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]
It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim's hand and leaves]
The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we���re about to do?
Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'
I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.
Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.
Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]
Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] ���Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.���
I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
Shhh.  Don't be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle]  ...oh no.
[cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He���s gonna be moving slowly. It���s only���
Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.
[turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!
Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]
The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...
No! No, Oscar. He���s a friend. He���s a friend.
Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]
I will stay here and run things on this end.
[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?
It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.
Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don���t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
So who will be your new Number Three?
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
[answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
We did it, we did it. I love you.
Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?
[scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.
Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]
Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
[yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]
And I���ve never seen you go to work, ever.
I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.
Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]
Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.
Open the gates! There���s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There���s plenty for everyone!
My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?
Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]
Oh, we do. So we���ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don���t see the point. It���s so Wall Street.
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
If you say screw you one more time...
No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly]
[scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Jeez! What���s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]
My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.
Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.
Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.
Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
Oh God... ��Hey no! Where do you think you���re going? You���ve gotta stay for the big presentation we���ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He���s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
[singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick]
A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
What are you doing? Those are my keys.
In a way it���s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they���ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I���ll have a grandson.
[moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention]
There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
[puts his grandmother���s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]
OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]
Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.
Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.
And this chair���s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
Excuse me, I got a question for you.
Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.
[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
I'm about to buy this building, you know.
Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
[straightens Andy's tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute'
Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.
There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
Don't be mad, it is a business trip.
Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
I can see that as a very real possibility.
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
No, no, don't, don't tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.
Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you���re ever in the area, you���ll always have a place to stay���in my barn.
All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.
Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].
Let���s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
It���s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I���d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.
[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
You think Jim���s lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.
I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.
Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!
Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]
Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel.
Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?
Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?
Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn���t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
The target-- it���s Oscar, isn���t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
Paranoid? I���m not familiar with the word. And I really don���t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
And how big do you want this robot?
[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]
He���s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
Look.  She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She's a bumpkin.  Pass.
This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn���t seem so macho now, does it? It���s a jump rope!
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.
I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
Ha ha! Yeah, joke���s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Jim���wha��� Come on! What���what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
Actually��� You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I���ll take one too.
Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I���ll be right back.
[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.
It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts]
Can I get you a tankard of mead?
I already made an appointment��� with your secretary.
But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
You just said it. You just said it.
I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ���The Grass Roots��� in the 1960���s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying]
You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
What for? We haven���t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren���t deep fried, right?
Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.
This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.
Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
[sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]
What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
[shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
Well today���s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face]
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let���s go!
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They���re not for me. They���re for my cousin Mose. He���s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!
Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?
What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
[talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
Why don't you just buy the whole song?
My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.
[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.
Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.
Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the?
Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can���t believe you came.
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
I���d like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]
Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
Maybe if you listened a little bit, you���d improve. No wonder women despise you.
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]
[throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.'
The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.
First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'  Those are the money beets.
And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, 'muffin basket.' Then I thought, 'What���s even more precious to people than muffins?'
Well, saddles��� [clicks tongue, whinnies] ��� sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby.
Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
[has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.
You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.
What lab did these little clones escape from?
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you���re in a suicide cult.
We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
[while everyone is gathered playing and singing ���Sons & Daughters���] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
You think I don���t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I���ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne���er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don���t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]
The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There���s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ���the White Whale���. Look at all that sweet blubber.
Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.
Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
And I was thinking it���s only fair that you help make this decision since they���ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
Just slip it off my���Slip it off my hips.
Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.
[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't...
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
Yeah, maybe I���ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it���s the most pleasant I���ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ��� What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
[singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three 'M's. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.
[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.
Okay, here���s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can���t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!
OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.
[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?
It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.
Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late.
Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I���m back.
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
She said she was only sleeping with me.
Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
That doesn���t sound crazy, Jim. That���s the sanest thing I���ve ever heard.
If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk]
[changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.
[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!
When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier���s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?
No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]
Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.
There���s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!
It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam's shoulders] You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
That���s right. Will you just give us a second?
Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.
OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial.
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
I gave her a higher clearance than you.
I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.
Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
This is exciting! You���re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
What do you think?  You've got an hour.
I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM!  Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM! [pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.
You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]
Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]
[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please.
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They���ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ���em on in there.
Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]
Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
No no no, I can't let you do this!
I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.'
I don't want people making fun of my nose.
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?
Shhh, Pam. C���mon, don���t be such a right-sider.
So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]
Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.
OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]
This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
I know. I could just bang you right now.
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
No, you���re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ��L--
Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
I���d love to be in the loop, David.
Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...
[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.
So, you ever been convicted of a felony?
No, it���s not. Here���s how we find out. Let���s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let���s just size each other up here and left side of the list��� ATTACK!
Then looks like we have a deal��� Son [holds up a suit identical to his]
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
It's a job interview, not a flea market.
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.
How dare you all attack him like this.
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
[Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here���s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]��� Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
You did. Several times. Over and over again.
Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.
[fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they���re not even good. Really, they���re bad. Like you and your son.
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.
And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.
Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review.
Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
So, you can tell your clients: ���Unleash the power of the pyramid.���
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.
Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]
Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.
What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.
Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby]
Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.
Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
I���m sorry. I���ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
Where you come from, and who you are.
[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.
Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]
You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.
Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
You've done more then you can possibly know.
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]
Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
I do not!  I do not say 'Hi' Pam!
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
[to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.
Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!
It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
[off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
Do you want to do this right or not?
Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
Why would I put a banana in my holster?
Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
[on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I...
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
[lays on bed] Really?  I hadn't noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
From when he recommended me to replace him.
[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?
[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!
This conversation has two items on the agenda.
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]
Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves]
These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
There's so much more to it than that.
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could���ve met in the lobby. It���s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!
That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]
Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not?
Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]
We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?
Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.' Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We���re running late. Let���s get him inside.
No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.
Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
You can't steal what is legally your property.
Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
[plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
This is war and that is what happens.
We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?
No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]
Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody's found the hog maw.
[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
I love finding a good set of twins.
You are clean. Okay��� One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He���s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I���ve got big expectations, Mose-wise.
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.
The bride and groom? What are their names?
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
Andy is complicating things.  But I'm not worried.  This will only up my game.
I���d have to get some more wire and string, but it���s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car.
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.
I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
[continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!
[exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive.
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn���t even know it. I���ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.
Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn���t you say?
There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They���re extraordinary.
Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]
You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet���.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]
Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
[whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.
Prestige is ours. Okay, they���re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
Don't make me do this the hard way.
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...
The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!
I'll do it! I always say, 'You want something done right? Ask Dwight.' Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
Well, well, well, it���s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]
Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.
No need we can just check the security tapes.
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.
[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
But this isn���t interim manager. No. It���s Dwight K. Schrute��� [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
[laughs while spray painting ���Jim is Awesome��� on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?
I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
[sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.
Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.
Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
I'm ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
Mmm. That���s a good��� question. 300 times��� [Jim hangs up] 180��� Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
Yeah, you don���t want Italian. You���ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you���ll be doing life in Rikers Island.
And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
[at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side.
Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]
The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.
[out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
There���s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list]
Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
[scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]
I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
[Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying.  When my workers-gather-
Well, they can���t all be winners. But Trevor���s next and he���s a real professional. You say, ���Jump,��� and he says, ���Oh who?��� He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand]
[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
It can���t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger���s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
[takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]
I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]
Iris, thank you so much for having me.
I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it.
Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it 'Hay Place'. Eldred Called it 'Hay World'. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.
Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ���Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.��� [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.
You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!
Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
It���s 15 feet down, it���s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it���s like your catching a medicine���
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane���s coming.  I suppose you���re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
Don���t worry, it���s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It���s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.
[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.
No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I���ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.
You know there's a ghost in this office
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
Uh, if they don't bobble, what's the point?
It���s just one thing. Just let me���let me do this���
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.
These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, ���perfect pork anus��� which I don't mean.
It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
You know what? You���re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you���re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
[looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning 'Love,' and adelph, meaning 'Adolf.' 'the city that loves Adolf.' Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?
Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
We all have a hero in our heart.
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
I know. I know exactly what to do.
My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don���t quit your day job.
[shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]
...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
[putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
Maybe you do. Hi. I���m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It���s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
It's about this very announcement you just made.
Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.
The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.
You need to do something about your B.O.
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder]
And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.
[struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
Oh, you think they���re my only friends? I���ve got way more friends than that, and they���re all better than the losers who work here.
It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]
I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go!
Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
This is not a test! Move to the exits!
There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
[sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh��� No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J���rg Ro���kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.'
[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!
[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is���for���Kevin.
OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
Is that the last year the data was available?
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.
No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?
Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
[on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that's my name.  See you soon.
Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her.
[tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!
Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
But we were gonna break the pig rib.
You took something that doesn't belong to you.
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put
It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you���re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don���t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!
He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
But the little cars go in the compact spot!
Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again]
No, but we should discuss that another time.
[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.
Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]
I can���t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I���ll be launched into space. God, you���re so insensitive.
Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]
Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
[grunts] Okay, we���re good. We���re good. Let���s go. Push!
You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...
Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
Is that how they like to get in?
Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
What the? [follows Nellie into the break room]
I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Well, the alert was already set to ���Red��� because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ���Double Red���?
[to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
You had black hair and then gray hair.
[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
Oh, don���t lie. I���m trying to save those precious knees you���re always bragging about. ��Now, let���s get out of here. He could be right behind us.
[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?
I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.
[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
Could be a bat weevil��� Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
He went over your head to go behind your back.
Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
[still typing] He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
Look, I have no problem with women. It���s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don���t lie about your shoulders!
They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
[Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
[Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!
Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.
I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...
I need to make a sales call.  Please?
Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
I���m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where���s Stanley?
[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can���t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could���ve choked so many people by now.
It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
I can try. I���m gonna use SMS text.
Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it���s an idea. But what does it mean?
That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.
That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...
You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
I���m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager���s job?
Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I'm in pain.
[wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too 'meh' or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing 'I wear makeup'] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?
Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Don���t be an idiot. It���s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you���ve been here. That���s the max.
[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.
And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?
I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
No, we haven���t ordered anything. No one���s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.
I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He���s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He���s my tribe.
[drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!
Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
No. Let him get his own. It���s Syracuse money.
Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
You said you didn't know how to say it.
Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.
Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
[Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, 'Kind of.'
Hoist him aloft. C���mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]
I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
[as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.
Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.
Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I���ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]
Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?
Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!
Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]
We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
And you will be hearing from the -
Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
[looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this.
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
Louder! You���re shouting it from the back of a horse!
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?
Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
I could, but I just don���t feel like it loser.
Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers]
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]
One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He���s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I���m hesitant. Why can���t I pull the trigger on any of them?
That���s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
[holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
My pants fell down! I don���t have a belt!
I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'
Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Look at him. I���ve never seen such a beautiful child.
Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
And they said it couldn���t be done. Boom!
I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]
No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who.
So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can]
[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but���
You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]
You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
I know how we can learn his tricks.
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
He doesn't even know that I do that.
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor]
Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
What do you think I am saying to you?!
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha���You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]
I don't get that, I don't understand that.
Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
Oh, I doubt you���ll make it. Very few do who���ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you���ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's...
Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
Cause I could look it up real easily.
Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
Wha ��� what is this supposed to be?
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
[at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?
Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
[angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
The eyes are the groin of the head.
There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?
Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
[trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's 'Let's Get Physical' starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]
Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
There's no gum. There never was any gum.
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
I never said it was better than an iPod.
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That���s not true.  Just give me another chance.
Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part]
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.
His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam���s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn���t see it, or didn���t wanna see it.
[on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?
Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!
No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
Yes. Fast food. I���ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Oh, I���m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I���m not in your panties, I don���t go vigilantes. Why don���t you ask your husband?
It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.
[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
It���s a colloquial way of saying ���you���re fired,��� Kevin, which you are.
I wanted to offer you a new position.
Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
[scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
No. We can���t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]
Of course there���s a costume! [laughs] ��Oh, this is gonna be great. There���s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
[on phone with Jim] I hope you���ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it���s time for another episode of ���Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire���.
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I���m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there���s a mini-reunion. A kind of a ���where are they now��� panel at a local theatre. It���ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven���t seen Kevin since we let him go.
I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I���m finished, it���s over.
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
That���s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
What kind of mileage does this baby get?
[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.
This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]
No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.
Really? That���s interesting. ���Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who���s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]
Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan]
You know, you���re right! We hadn���t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]
[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]
This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
I think I cut my penis on the lid!
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that���s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
Don���t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]
Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]
Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind.
And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.
[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?
You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
I wish I could hire all of you.
Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
So what do you need me to do?
Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
Gotcha! Yeah! Let���s see ya get out of this web, huh?
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
[jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
What?  No, this is about the right size.
Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So���[clears throat]
Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...
Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]
Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face.
For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
So why is this on your resume? [door slams]
English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.
���But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark���s getting out of my car. He���s a good boy, does whatever I say.
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager���s office before?
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
[whispering] I don���t know. I just don���t know.
Yeah, right. I���m afraid that ship has sailed.
What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face]
Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]
Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
I would make sure that you were dead.
[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the 'trappings' of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I���m telling you... if you don���t do this, [whispers] I don���t stand a chance. Please, Jim.
[turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]
Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
Okay, listen. I���m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I���ve never actually done this before.
Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
Well, it���s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
Oh, no, no, no. It���s good. It���s really -- on the Internet, it���s a really -- that���s a really good, good, thing.
Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing 'Centerfold.'] They might be listening to us.
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ���
Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back.
I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
I thought he was out on the road.
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
Wow, that���s great. That���s great. Ok, good, let���s talk about that, ok?
Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight]
It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ���please kitty, may I have some more?��� You can���t make this stuff up!
Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.
You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I���ll do mine���.. walnuts?
Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
[interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]
[to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
Let me get that door for you--  [runs to open door]
No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That���s right. You���re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.
Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
I want to be here when you fire her ass.
What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'IT WAS DWIGHT' written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]
It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?
[scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!
Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
[eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela's candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm.
Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
[Holds his finger to Jim's lips] Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim]
No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling]  Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!
Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
I���m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We���ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie���?  Lick the spoon?
Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
[to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.
[stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]
Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.
Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
[from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.
Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?
Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.
[yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!
[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl]
Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?
Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
[hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!
How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.'
This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
.. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]
Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They���re a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We���d go in pretending to be family ��� brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store.  Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.
Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you���ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ���Infuriating, irresponsible���...
Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
Bet you I got mine for less than yours.
Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing ��� bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You���re gonna love ���em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world���s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan���s costume and check out his notes.
Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It���s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
It would be better if you were unconscious.
Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?
It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
Now, for the last time, I���d like a side salad with balsamic.
Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
Hi Daryl. I���m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you���re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!
No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?
[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
I'm serious. What did you do to it?
Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
Oh, I bet you think it���s all about core, huh?
Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.
Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]
[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
I want him to have all the urine he needs.
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ��� how do I put this ��� steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.
We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard.
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
Okay, this isn���t working for me, ���cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package]
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!
You know what? I made you a cd...
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!
Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news���thing.
You did this for me? [camera pans to 'Welcome Back Oscar' sign]
You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
I am so sorry.  I'm so sorry, sir.
Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'
Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end.
[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.
Let���s just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice]
Why would Michael give you one before me?
This is not a test! Can you leave?!
Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
That���s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
Hello, spoiled little baby, [to a watermelon] in your fancy brand name stroller.  Mmm, I wonder if it's as safe as they say it is.  Oh, look, a curb.  Uh oh, let's see what happens... [lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.  My parents left me beside the road.  I crawled home.
Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
All their top clients I can't believe it.
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief]
And he made us all look like chumps!
You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls.  We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!
Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.
[walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry.
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
Wow. So much crap. It���s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]
That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.
Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
[off screen] What are you guys talking about?
Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.
She���s got a ton of great qualities. She���s young, she���s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we���re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn���t technically incest.
Okay, I���m a woman. [high voice] I���m a woman. Good?
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let���s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man���s closet.
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]
[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
[Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
[clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
It���s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we���re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
[lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder.
Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don���t lie. I can tell if you���re lying.
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
Very well, we will come back at 5:15.
Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job.  Interested?
Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!
[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?
I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!
Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.
No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
Could I have a copy of one of them?
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
Guys, it wasn���t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn���t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
That never happened. He���s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ���saving treats��� from the kitty litter box.
This is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.
You were making me do things that were not all right.
Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I���ve ever made.
[scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.  [bites into the sandwich half, chews]  Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]
I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
No, you���ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
Oh, man, never thought I���d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he���s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that���s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.
Jim couldn���t land me in a thousand years.
[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?
How much longer is this going to take?
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?
Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin]
I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?
They are either going to say yes... or no.
Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
[typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don���t see them so I think we���re good.
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]
Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
Wait, I see you every day. Can I say 'Good month?'
[sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
I do not respect her, but I will go.
No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
Hey. Come on, buddy. Let���s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don���t compare. When you���re with the R-O-L-F, you���re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.
[on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.
Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes.  Also.
You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Nice to see you. May I hold him?
[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves]
[looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
I���m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room]
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
[singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Oh, I'm OK.  I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That���s it? Oh, that���s great. That���s like a five second delay.
Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
You���re the Quizno���s. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn���t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
I can get you exotic meats ��� hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
[Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
I know. That���s not why I���m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'
All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I'm really sorry... about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.
David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim���s desk while he���s away in Philly. Finally I���ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It���s like, ���Really, Jim? You don���t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.��� Wow.
Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
[On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
Do you live in a regular sized house?
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
This interview is over. I'll let you know.
Well something's come up, I have to go.
Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.
I'm only going to ask you this once. Are you part of an alliance?
Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.
Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
[to group] OK, let���s look at some ties.
We are going to have two men's rooms.
Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
And you didn���t call Jim - that seems significant.
I���ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I���m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Oh no, I���m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
No. And the sheets are made of fire.
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here���s something. Who would eat who in an ���Alive��� situation. No... that can���t be it.
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
[stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.
It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.
You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
All we can do is sit and wait.
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don���t even care about nationals.
Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It���s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I���d be happy to see Jim as manager.
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
[picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]
It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]
This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.
Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound.
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That���s Lloyd.
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
No. Putting a load on more like it.
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-
Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!
No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk]
Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then.'
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!
Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
Okay. But it���s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can���t scrub worth a damn.
Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that���s great.
I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.'
[grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.
It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!
I have no way of knowing if that's true.
There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.
Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
[punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]
Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance.
[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]
Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
How do you know it's going to be a boy?
Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
[referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]
Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
You had to, what other choice did you have?
I do. But you married my worst enemy.
[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
Here���s how I���m going to help out from now on. I���m going to not care, and I���m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy���s inevitable demise.
Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]
No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?
You won���t stop until you���ve poached us all.
Hey, how's it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
He���s like a manatee. Ready? Let���s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley���s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.�� No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
I need to go over some details with you.
Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]
Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over.  I'm sorry.
Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?
No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.
Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?
NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file]
No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
[on the phone] ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber.
If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.
Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here.
Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
All you have to do it say it.
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices]
Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
���Higher than numbers go.��� The ceiling above accounting!
[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]
No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it���s barely three pounds.
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
I started a fire with my cheese pita.
I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]
[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.
Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes.
I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don���t know where I���d put you.
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
[singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]
Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
[answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
Try again��� Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one��� is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long.
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk]
Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]
I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
Let's table that. So, temp... You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar.
[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.
Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
Thank you. I mean, I���ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh���
Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession?
[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
Boo, unimpressed. It���s a tightrope for babies. Boo!
[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, 'that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.' And I said, 'I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.' Well, hello Danny!
[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
Yeah, and we���re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Well, I���ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.
There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
[scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch]
