No, I insist.
On a boat.
That���s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
I'm not answering that. You answer it.
It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
Fine.
Like a wolf. Thank you.
Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
What was your mile time?
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
Also, he slept with Pam.
On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
[punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]
Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
I don't think so, no.
How do you spell 'animalian'?
Try 'Big Boobs' with a 'Z'.
Same page. Just keep moving.
I'm on it.
Oh, how did that happen?
Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
Oh my god.
Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?
Psst.
Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we���re about to do?
If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
No, impish or admirable.
No.
Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
You did. Several times. Over and over again.
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Talk to you later, Jan.
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let���s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man���s closet.
[bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.
Basement office? You mean like a lair?
I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
Because we're friends.
Okay. [sits]
It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
Action.
Or none of you [chuckles]
Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
Men find me desirable.
That place doesn���t exist. It���s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it's handle] You sell a lot of these?
I'm the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!
Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute.
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
In juvie.
You're number four.
Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
Bye poochie!
There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you���re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
Good.
What else?
I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
Right. Which one is that?
What? This is such bullcrap!
Who, me?
What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three 'M's. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.
Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
He knew all along!
Do you
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
I have something to do.
Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
What branch?
I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that.
Michael?
You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.
Exactly.
I'll do the best I can.
Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
Hello.
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
I have to do something to his eyes.
She had a hysterectomy.
[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]
Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
I thought he was out on the road.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
Walk out of the house...
[answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
Yeah, get them, Creed!
No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
What is this?
You have to interview me...
Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
No thanks.
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
[sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.
Attention blue collar workers!
Yeah, you said...
Excellent question.
Yeah, deal with it Pam!
It doesn't make any sense.
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Retaliation. Tit for tit.
That's fine.
Yeah!
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
It's only twenty-five bucks.
Shh, shh, shh.
[laughs] Right? Come on!
I love that show.
Bring it.
He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
Michael! My water's breaking!
Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.
Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don���t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He���s gonna be moving slowly. It���s only���
[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn���t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
It's all right. It's all right.
[yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
Not counting the last one, 25.
[on phone] Dwight Schrute.
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
No.
They could do better.
Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]
Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.
Let's do this thing.
No communication with the outside world Jim.
Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.
[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
How do you know it's going to be a boy?
I will trade you for the used candle.
Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
She sent an email, so.
You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Wow.
Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ��We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
Oh, no, no, no. It���s good. It���s really -- on the Internet, it���s a really -- that���s a really good, good, thing.
[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
Who is he saying?
I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.
Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
Queen's higher.
Eh, I've been sitting all day.
No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]
Oh, not gonna happen.
Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
Andy���[knocks] I need to talk to you.
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
No.
That's a conflict of interest.
Boo, unimpressed. It���s a tightrope for babies. Boo!
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
You need to do something about your B.O.
Move it! One, two, three. [grunts]
Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
...because you are never going to see him again.
Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
Jim, what are you doing?
[sighs] You're an idiot.
[sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back!
We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]
Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
Possibly.
Yes.
Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.
May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
Okay.
Try Dwight.
Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
Pam, would you care for a bagel?
[turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]
Why didn't I go to business school?
Cool, let's start with the banisters.
I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
No.
[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
The twirl sucks.
[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
Ah! Not so fast.
Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.
Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves]
So am I.
[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
[creepy smile]
What's next?
Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
[Reading from computer] ���Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!��� That means you can't make me do squat.
Okay, I can do that.
Perhaps.
[panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.
No, it���s not. Here���s how we find out. Let���s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let���s just size each other up here and left side of the list��� ATTACK!
Thank you, Angela.
Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
Oh that���s real creative.
What? No, but I --
They have some great kitchen ideas.
[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
No wait, what are you doing?!
[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
I need to go over some details with you.
Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]
I apologized for that.
OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Limbo, whoo!
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
Wow.
Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
So, all the numbers adding up?
You came into my office voluntarily.
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
What do you have in mind?
Yeah!
Nice.
You have till five.
You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
We'll see.
Not yet.
Same thing.
Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
Thanks.
[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
Come on, let���s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Yeah.
What?
Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.
I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
Friends with a hobbit.
You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
[cries harder] Thank you, Michael.
I'm just --
What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
Are you referring to alchemy?
C���mon.
My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.
I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
All Right!
Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end.
Jim, put those away.
Blood, urine, or semen.
I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
Yes.
Impish or admirable.
It's non-transferable...
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]
Here���s how I���m going to help out from now on. I���m going to not care, and I���m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy���s inevitable demise.
Oh, Esther.
Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
I haven't made a decision yet.
Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
I didn't say anything
Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
[walks in dressed as Jim] Pam.
Oh God.
As has Angela!
Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
Oh no, it's broken.
Hey... what are you guys doing?
[digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?
It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
[chokes up]
Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
The most important one of the guys.
Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.
I have to put you on with my boss.
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
And how big do you want this robot?
[angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
What lab did these little clones escape from?
Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
Get out of here moron! [Jim leaves]
We're gonna bust this guy.
OK, this is stupid.
No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
What?
[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]
Either he goes, or I go.
Okay. What'd you get?
Oh, no. Oh, no!
Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.
Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
Ok
If you let me run it.
Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog. [runs with stroller]  Oh, no!  Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer [forcefully pushes stroller away toward uneven ground with junk strewn around, the stroller hits some junk, stays upright, and stops safely]
My cousin Mose told me a joke.
[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can]
Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?
Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.
What are some of your small business ideas?
Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I���m sure he���d give a reference.
I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
Pam, hello.
There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
Were you absent?
Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
Not a viable option.
Yeah.
I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
[rolls eyes] Jim, come on.
She probably scrubbed it
Fine, let���s go. [grunts]
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
No!
What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
I'm... I was making it.
Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
Well something's come up, I have to go.
Thank you, Andy.
Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Oh, my God.
Well I'm not responsible for that!
So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
You seem a little nervous. You shouldn't be.
You know there's a ghost in this office
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
Accepted.
No, no. No margarita. Hot sake.
Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?
It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
Michael? Please! Come on!
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
[joins in] Shrute! Shrute!
Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Michael, I need to talk to you.
[takes contract] Absolutely, I will.
I don't know.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
How about 5:15?
I knew you would, Nancy.
Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
Hold still, woman!
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
Any employee may dispose a food item...
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
Word.
Can you breathe?
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
Who's the target?
You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
Michael-
There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They���re extraordinary.
Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
Angela, what about you?
Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
[laughs] What do you think?
No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.
The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
[In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
Well don't look so surprised.
Hello. Jim?
Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?
Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.
I'm stronger.
Just say it.
Ok, tell him that's not true.
Aww, Darryl.
Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
You stop.
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
Fifty L.
I'm on official business.
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?
Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
You did.
I do!
Where are we going?
You were on a boat.
I don't understand the reference.
You're an idiot.
Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
Which one is it?
What are you doing?
[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.
Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.
Try me.
Everybody! Hang on! [Dwight pulls out quickly]
Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts]
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
[winks] I'm on it. [leaves room]
[to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]
And circle gets the square.
Ah, I'm not interested.
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Part of my job.
[Dwight groans] Ugh.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, I'm equipped... I can...
Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
[picks up pencil between his toes]
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager���s job?
Alleged contract.
In your face!
[takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
Knight Rider.
You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn���t you say?
I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
Him or me?
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
Get in the car.
I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
No.
Come along, afterthought.
I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
Yeah.
To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
I left a message at corporate.
You said you didn't know how to say it.
One more. To our boss!
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?
Okay, I'm on it!
[laughs] Nice.
Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?
Wolves.
We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
Yeah? Like what?
No thank you.
Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
Now, Jim!
Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?
He even looks like a mole.
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
That would have been really embarrassing.
But don't forget you owe me $10.
No women or children, unless provoked.
OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]
Why? I don't understand.
Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]
In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
No.
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]
What's this?
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Maybe if you listened a little bit, you���d improve. No wonder women despise you.
Which is, of course���
So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.
$30,000? There's gotta be another way.
What? No way!
Let's get this roof going.
I am so sorry.  I'm so sorry, sir.
Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?
Thank you.
Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can���t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
Me! Me, me, me.
Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
I'm just...
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
[referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
Don't do it!
No doy!
Is somebody after you?
Stanley! Wake up! You���ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
These covers are totally indestructible.
I love finding a good set of twins.
No way, it's the KGB.
...from the 1930's...
And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
Busy!
Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
Into your-
You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
Yes!
No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
Observe. [walks towards desk]
Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
Really?
No, it's marijuana.
That's true.
Any specific animal?
People who don't trust egg whites.
Pam...
That���s very true. Get the hell outta here.
Not my problem.
Disarm!
I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
So what do you need me to do?
Oh.
What about your party?
[talking over Jim] Okay.
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Good. Good. And...
Do you want to die? OUT!!
Rolph, leave it alone!
OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.
Forget it. I'll look it up myself.
Is that how they like to get in?
It's about this very announcement you just made.
You���re a good assistant, Jim.
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
Yes, you do.
Oh, so glad I could help.
Obviously. I knew it.
Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
I decided earlier.
Ooh, I love repartee.
Deceit does not come easy to me.
Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
Not what I asked.
I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.
I can't see.
Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
What were you talking about in there?
Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
What? It's a casual, social outfit.
What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late.
Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
[answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
Yeah!
Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Come on. Come on.
No.
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He���s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I���m hesitant. Why can���t I pull the trigger on any of them?
Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I���ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I���ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I���m doin��� great.
[coughs sentence] You're the idiot!
You can't possibly be serious.
I���ve seen enough.
[pantless] OK, how is my voice now?
Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
Aaaaah!
It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]
Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
This is not Mega-Desk.
Every day is black tie optional!
There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
Out of loyalty to this company...
Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me!
Clarice?
We have... a bat... in the office.
Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]
Wait, it���s not D.M Utica, is it?
It���s true.
That's bad.
Impossible.
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
No.
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
No, it's an accountability booster.
Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
Yes you will.
Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
Yeah.
Party's over. You are so busted!
They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again]
What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
Let's get to it.
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.
Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
I need you to perform a test.
OK, can we steer away from gay people?
[whispering] Say you're sorry times infinity...
I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
What are you doing?
You guys should use a hand truck.
Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
Michael. Michael?
Oh my god.
Correct.
Yes. I would welcome it.
Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
More of a, barbaric growl.
I do not look worried.
Ohh.
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
Have a seat.
Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]
Good. Really really good.
[walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim's pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim's voice] 'We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our...' [pauses recording] I've got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  I'm not insane. [starts the recording again] '...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.'
You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.' You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
Ow.
Kids? You don't even have a girlfriend.
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!
I'm sorry, Michael
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
Michael.
All right, we're set.
Yeah.
Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.
Mm-hmm.
If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
Nice.  Do you have any blonde women?
Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it���s your call.
Sabotage.
Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now?  It's not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
Yeah.
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.
That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ���poisoned��� by Aunt Shirley.
Cut.
He's lying.
So, I'm paying full price?
No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.
I am a person.
No.
[with a small fist pump] Yes!
Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!
Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]
Oh, man, am I a woman?
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face]
Washington Monument.
I could tell, from the body language.
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
It was nothing personal. It���s just that you were terrible at your job.
Okay, you can stop.
Gotcha! Why are you late?
So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
I can't do this.
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
What do you want!?!
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
[looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren���t going to look back.
[On Phone] One...
Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
My idea!
Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
I don't get to wear my ties.
So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let���s go!
I've only had to use it once.
Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
He is a goner.
I will never be your vichyssoise.
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial.
But I don't have any...
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
Oh God... ��Hey no! Where do you think you���re going? You���ve gotta stay for the big presentation we���ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He���s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
That would be nice wouldn't it?
Would that make you happy?
Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
Well, I did it too.
Oh.
I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
I would make sure that you were dead.
I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]
Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
While you were gone...
Angela, you're up.
[excited] Get out! I���m a dad!
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, 'muffin basket.' Then I thought, 'What���s even more precious to people than muffins?'
This is how I breathe.
I will pay you whatever it takes.
Am I nomadic?
Hello, Angela.
Yes. And my decision in final.
You are an impressive specimen.
Erin....the receptionist!
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?
No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
Let's go.
Yeah.
You've already been several times.
That���s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Packer.
Yeah!
[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
No!
Phyllis.
Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]
Yes you can.
Why Jim?
Jan, have you ever had deer?
It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
Sorry.
Number one!!
Hey, it's not a surprise.
Damn it!
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Yup.
So long Donna! [Michael hangs up]
Whassup.
No women or children. Unless provoked.
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.
[attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah!
Did you see the board?
Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.
In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
Tell him, not Dwight.
Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
And he made us all look like chumps!
No. [holds Sheriff's Department mug protectively]
Jan Levinson-Gould.
That's not why you lost.
Where is my desk?
Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]
Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I���m telling you... if you don���t do this, [whispers] I don���t stand a chance. Please, Jim.
Loser.
Do the monkey face!
Standing.
Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair]
Okay, what's next?
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
I don't know.
I would like to arrange a truce.
Sometimes it hurts Michael.
Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
Well, I'm not done yet.
Very good.
Or get hit by a car-
You wanted to see me?
What?
Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
No!
I can... Yes, sensei.
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review.
Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
I choose Michael!
Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me.
What's this?
[sighing]
I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
What do you mean?
[scoffs] Vaccines are for chumps!
Thank you.
Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
Extend the fingers more.
Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who.
So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
Here we go. Make a wish.
Done.
Not so weak, huh, Mom?
Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
All right! What is going on here?
No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.'
Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that���s great.
Define foment.
Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!
All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
Yes.
Yes.
As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
Absolutely not.
Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager���s office before?
OK, everybody just calm down.
A hunter.
No.
What?
Poor little fella.
Watch and learn.
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
Xterra's not even a real word.
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
I know how we can learn his tricks.
Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]
Do you know what 'snap decision' means?
What do you say?
Message in a Bottle, The Postman...
Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.
What?
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
Absolutely... not.
And you are���
Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
Think it through.
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
Oh, no. What's wrong?
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
[sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is���for���Kevin.
How do I look?
Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?
Lake Erie.
Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.
Everybody!
It was playful hazing.
Stanley, could you come with me, please.
And she is your boss.
What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
Welcome to the club, pig! [laughs]
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Action.
Go ahead, you do it.
[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
Jim. I���m not kidding. I need you.
Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
Different guy.
Eh, its not that early.
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.
Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]
I bet she had hairy armpits.
Okay.
All right. Are you okay?
Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ���The Grass Roots��� in the 1960���s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
[whispering] You're gonna blow it.
Okay. Come on! Jim!
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
Let���s get him inside.
I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
[scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
Ready?
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
Who took all the black ones?
Hope - grows.
Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?
But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]
Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?
[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]
Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
Did I tell you about her teeth?
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
Yep.
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
Shh. Do you hear that?
Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
P.S. We should should kill him.
Come on. Come on.
Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You'll be back.
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Uh huh.
Keep them.
Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela]
Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
No? Then you are an idiot.
But as Jim and I discovered...  No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
With this move, he can't get you.
When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
That's good, let's wrap it up.
How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that���s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
Are you serious?
Alright. [leads Michael away]
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
No.
Let's single...
Are there any bloggers around?
Let's talk pubes, people.
Aha! A lightbulb.
[enters quickly] You need my pitchfork?
...so good.
[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
Cow, goat or sheep.
You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
What does it say?
[over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
No you're not.
Yes!
OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
Give it a whirl.
Jim is essential to th-
That���s right Jim.
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.
I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the?
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Give me that.
This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
All right, I'll take them.
There's a hose out back.
Seventy-two hours.
Hit the nos.
It's not effeminate. It's festive.
Command central.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
WE ARE WARRIORS!
Was that your per diem?
Just lice Pam?
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Michael, I...
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.
How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
What?
Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What���s going on Nellie? Talk to me.
You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]
Let it out.
What are you doing? Those are my keys.
No! No, Oscar. He���s a friend. He���s a friend.
[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
In which direction?
Oh no, no, no.
You can't do that.
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Damn you.
No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
That is not in the contract.
Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
Yes.
I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
That's it.
Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
I'm Jigsaw, idiot.
How convenient.
Hazel.  They're hazel.
Really?
Me too. [smirking]
Hey, you're making me spray!
Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
So what do we know about her?
And you will be hearing from the -
So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don't hang up.
Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car.
Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
Wow--
Pushing on.
Yeah- oh!
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!
Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
Is it?
That's what I said.
Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
Good shocks.
Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?
Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
She was stoned apparently.
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
Yeah?
Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
God... Damn it! Why us?
We have better service than they do!
Yes. Fast food. I���ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
That���s a bit extreme.
You know me.
I see dead people.
Sure.
Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
What if he's a murderer?
..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
Not all the time.
Henrietta.
No, you don't.
Exactly.
Ding dong.
...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
Ok. Who reports to who?
Well, don't look, freak!
So I���ve got your resume here, but it���s not telling me everything.
[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]
Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
And you didn���t call Jim - that seems significant.
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
No!
No.
I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
Maybe it's what she does here...
I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Mm-hm.
[gasps]Wait, the numbers!
No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
Shh.
[kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
[shouts from another room] What did you do?
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
[looking up at Creed] Dad?
Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
Yeah I���m serious.
Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you���ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ���Infuriating, irresponsible���...
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out.
Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?
For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.
Had 'em all my life.
[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
That is not a statue, that is a robot.
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it.
That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
Ten.
No... no. One crisis at a time.
I'm losing control of my bladder.
You know what?
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back.
[on telephone] Good. Excellent. Thank you.
I thought it went great.
This party is going to be awesome.
Get in!
No no no, I can't let you do this!
[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?
Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
What did you---
Zeke.
This is so awesome.
That's exactly the point.  You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know-
[still typing] He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
Please.
Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
What'd he say? What did he say?
Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part]
[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
A net? a giant net?
Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
[off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
Fail!
Why do they call him The Bus?
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
Dammit, Phyllis!
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
I can handle that.
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?
Phyllis, no. No.
It's that easy?
Where are you taking the client list?
No! Michael, no!
Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
What?
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
Good. How are you doing?
Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
What's jazz hands?
Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I���m back.
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don���t even care about nationals.
Con artist.
Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
Oh.
I'm sorry it makes me nervous.
I don���t see it.
Pam was supposed to get 'em.
Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
Do you need anything?
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
[to Packer] Silence.
Good morning, Michael.
[hands Erin a basket of beets]
Kevin Costner.
I might see a movie.
I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
Family only.
Oh, no, no. It's on the Miata.
Oh, it's so wet.
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
Go move some paper!
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
Actually��� You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I���ll take one too.
Is that what we were doing?
I need help.
There he is.
That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
I miss her so much.
GAH!!!
Eat it!
I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
Words will never be enough.
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
Leave the keys!
Dry rot?
Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
You took that with you.
All you have to do it say it.
No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand]
Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
Don't want it.
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
No. That is not a toy.
None taken. What do you got?
Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
Why not call...
Karen Filippelli.
[smiling] No thank you.
Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
It just doesn't add up.
Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.
Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
Where is Ryan?
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
Sign it.
Please?
My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
Question? May I investigate?
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
[out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
Got it.  Carb up.
Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
It's too small.
Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
Let me see.
They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Jonas.
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
I just might be his father.
Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
Those who can't farm, farm celery.
[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...
Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
Ugh. I'm hanging up.
Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]
Louder! You���re shouting it from the back of a horse!
[Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
Andy! Leapfrog! [Andy leapfrogs Dwight]
[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.
Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.
Judas.
Big day for you.
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
What's up-dog?
Hello.
Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
Wow. So much crap. It���s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
Just for a minute.
Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
It could be kind of funny.
Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
No, we haven���t ordered anything. No one���s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
Hey, HEY.
I can handle that.
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-
Yes.
Remember?
Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
[singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]
No, why were you in there?!
Next suggestion.
Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'
Step lively. Single file everybody.
Wow, that���s great. That���s great. Ok, good, let���s talk about that, ok?
Clarinet.
Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
Yeah. What?
Jim won't sign my expense report.
[sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
There were. A lot of them.
Aaaaaaaa!
You didn't have to.
Uh, it's not totally empty.
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
Me.
Just run! Take the stairs!
Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
Do you love me or not?
OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
It can���t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
Dwight Schrute.
Oh.
No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
I will tell on you.
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
That���s great. Let���s do this guys.
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl]
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying]
Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
Yeah.
So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Oh good. She broke up with you.
Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
Kill or be killed.
No.
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that...
Where you come from, and who you are.
What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.
[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.
I have no idea.
[Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
It is my idea.
[wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
One of the warehouse guys.
Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
What's it of?
This. Ends. Now.
Don't set it to yourself!
Don't you want a sheath for that?
It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
Really?  Anything.
You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
It's true.
It's from Battlestar Galactica.
Okay.
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
She's only a cat.
Mmm hmm.
Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
Uh, Oh.
I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
Yeah.
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
For reha-
Tokyo?
I'll have Pam send out a memo.
Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard.
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
Never mind. Just never mind.
Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.
Good Morning!
Wait, I got it! Confirmation code: XV2RDM!
Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
I can't believe this news.  That--- wow.
No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long.
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
That is correct.
Congratulations.
Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
[hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him]
Yeah, let's go.
Oh no, I���m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
And one girl push-up.
Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
I���m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We���ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
As Assistant Regional Manager...
Well, they can���t all be winners. But Trevor���s next and he���s a real professional. You say, ���Jump,��� and he says, ���Oh who?��� He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves]
So you'll be reporting to me, then.
I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
Put some ice on it.
What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
It is my duty...
[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
Schrute. Mister Schrute.
Yes... [whispers] I miss you.
Oh, God!
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
We'll be here waiting for you.
[typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
Who is the king of Austria?
I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
Nnnnn, that's not... okay.
Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
The waitress tripped on the cord.
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
Wow. Did your baby draw that?
Yup.
He said he would do the same for me.
No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
Oh man,
Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.
One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
[walking up] Michael?
I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
Pretty good.
No.
Like baboons or elephants.
You can't steal what is legally your property.
I already made an appointment��� with your secretary.
Ahh!
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
I know.
You're so immature!
Ho, thirty years.
I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?
But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
How do I become a manger at Sabre?
Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
That's not true.
Do you love her?
[shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
So tell me.
Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand]
It's Christmas Toby.
OK.
Thank you. [hangs up phone]
Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!
[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Oh. [dumps drink out]
Yeah...
Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
Next to me?
Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim's hand and leaves]
Hey, what was she like?
Dry. Delicious.
Oh, I���m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I���m not in your panties, I don���t go vigilantes. Why don���t you ask your husband?
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it���s an idea. But what does it mean?
No.
I could've gotten that, idiot!
Would you like the stink sack?
Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Nope.
And this chair���s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
It's a miracle.
Okay.
Some sort of virus?
That's my stopwatch.
Michael, nice tie or something.
Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
Having trouble finding a vein?
Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
Angela, not here!
What?
[re-entering the store] I'll take the wizard!
Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
You can't.
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
Based���on his merit.
You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession?
OK, temp.
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
Fresh hot ink.
What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
All Right
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
You, you, you, you...
Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
What?
OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
[coughs]
I can see that as a very real possibility.
OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
I don���t need your help.
Pam, please call security!
What?
I'll glance at it.
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!
The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.
Now. Now. Now.
Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
That���s right. Will you just give us a second?
I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
There were only two options.
[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.
Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
Come on!
Okay.
It's pony.
You know what you need? Closure.
Oh no, that is too bad.  Shoot.
Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
Just, write it down, please.
[excitedly] 'Ok' I can run it?
Describe it.
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
Oh, really? Uh-huh.
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
Okay, Jim.
No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]
Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
Master bee.
So can we come in?
Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
[yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
Damn it!
People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.
Stupid.
I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?
But check that it's covered by your
Inspiration.
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.
It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
Get in.
[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]
Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
Of course I checked it.
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
That is my stapler.
Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV.'
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
What... [mumbling]
He does? What does he say.
Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
uhhhh....no one.
Okay.
Later on.
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
Same thing.
Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
Hey, Michael.
Please sir! Spare him. Please.
Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
I didn't lose my desk.
OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
[whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?
Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
No, I wanna seduce her.
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?
[Toby uses tester on wall as Erin marks wall with red tape X] Oh, god.
Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael ...
Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
Can I drive?
Welcome aboard.
[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
Ok, let him know that I'm here.
I probably care more than she does.
--the party planning committee...
Oh, man!
Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
[looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Next suggestion.
Unbelievable.
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
What's a dis... what's that?
I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
Oh, why not?
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
All right.
Have you finished with the sketch?
Emergency dentist appointment.
This isn���t gonna work out.
Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
No, I didn't.
Well, you have...
She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
So what I���m hearing you say is, ���Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible���?
Pam, information is power.
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ���
[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, 'that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.' And I said, 'I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.' Well, hello Danny!
That's bad.
...with you. [chuckles]
Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!
Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
Come on!
Is it called red-vining?
It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
All right, let's do this.
Jim, are you serious?
What?  No, this is about the right size.
Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.' Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
Good luck to you. [disconnects call]
Thank you, Jim.
Yes, please.
Very good.
Excellent.
Everyone.
Screwgun. The sales call!
[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
Oh, our contract.
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
Awww!
Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
[yawns, ���Idiot��� is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!
You won���t stop until you���ve poached us all.
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that���s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.
What the? [follows Nellie into the break room]
Michael, you know I can't take this.
Excuse me?
Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
Shh Shh.
Yeah?
No.
Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
I told you.
What? Idiot.
From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]
No thank you.
Can I use your phone?
Yes, of course it does.
Smile!
Oh, you get kicked.
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.
They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
I don't think she'd be missed.
A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.
[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You���re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark���s shoulder]
Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
Terrible mistake.
I can try. I���m gonna use SMS text.
There's a photo...
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
[low] Oh God, here.
[whispering] What do you need from me?
Oh D.
Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.
What the hell is this?
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.
Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]
OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.
Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.
Ok, I get it.
If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
He looks great.
[holding mini-fan]  It slipped.
[smiles]
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
On one condition. You...
I don't wanna move desks!
Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you���re so smart. You���re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
That's just absurd.
I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
[interrupting] ��� lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
Of course.
Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.
Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.
Yeah, but no one here has it.
So who are we laughing at?
What did you do?
Oh, okay.
Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list]
That's not going to happen.
It'll all be goat.
What?
And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
That's what she said! [David laughs]
Where are gay mens��� vaginas?
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we���ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa.
Say it again.
No way.
Please?
The bride and groom? What are their names?
[tries to climb human pyramid] Ahh!
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley���s got way more body fat than they do.
So?
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
Where?
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It���s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I���d be happy to see Jim as manager.
Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you���re in a suicide cult.
Yes.
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
It's going very well.
No, my groin...
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]
Is that true?
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
Up here. [whistles]
Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
No. [typing on keyboard]
[running from his desk] Ayyyy!
Not my style.
Just wait and send it to voicemail.
Rebel Yell, Billy Idol
My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
...'cause there's no comeback for that.
What did you do? Huh?
Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?
Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
It���s a colloquial way of saying ���you���re fired,��� Kevin, which you are.
I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
OK.
Where did you get those?
[eating banana] Mm, less than three.
Yes!
[throws ���now��� beanbag at Jim] Now.
Shotgun!
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
[laughs] With sex!
Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
I started a fire with my cheese pita.
Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
Bring him the gabba-gool!
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
That's preposterous.
No, you���ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
Which is?
Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
Time for me to find out.
Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
[drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!
Kathy.
All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.
Nope, I wasn't bitten.
OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
Its Jim and Pam, Michael.
I wish I could menstruate.
That's Andy Bernard.
What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.
Oh, hey, I���ll take a coffee.
Get out of Jim���s seat.
Excellent idea, Pam.
[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!
Give me the hose!
I am not.
Really.
No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
[taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
Woo!
No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Watch your step.
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.
What---
Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
You said that?
Good luck, Michael.
Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
No.
You sure?
Five, four, three, two...
[singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
Die. You just... You said it.
Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
Yeah.
Good.
It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm busy.
[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.
[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
Recyclops will have his revenge.
Watching?
If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
Should I clean out my desk?
No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]
This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
Empty mind.
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
Same old.
[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
God. How do whalers do it?
Got it. Go.
Did you do her?
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'
[loudly applauds] Yes.
Ah! [throws punch] That���s how it���s done.
Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
What are you doing?
No. Putting a load on more like it.
So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good.
Whoa!
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands]
Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
Aah! Actually, he���s right in front of us.
Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
Get in.
Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot.
I can see the security guard's eyes.
He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
No. Let him get his own. It���s Syracuse money.
I'll stay for ten.
Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
But we were gonna break the pig rib.
Yum.
You!
Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
Robert! Robert California! Robert!
Parka...
Yeah.
Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
I do not have a knife!
Come on. Nice try, Josh!
So, let's get it going.
Jim couldn���t land me in a thousand years.
No one just called you.
Undistributable.
Movie idea?
[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
God... Damn it! Why us?
Okay.
[takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!
Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
That was... unauthorized.
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.
What?
It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
What are you doing?
Tom?
Yes.
Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
Are you enjoying your mineral water?
Very well, we will come back at 5:15.
Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
Thank you.
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
You know where it is. Lead me there.
Some of these people are for real.
Winners!
Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
Right. Okay? Great.
It is warm feelings.
What is this?
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
Seedless?
Come here, I���ll show you.
I can see that happening, yes.
I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
Wait. Are you saying...
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
Ha, nerd.
Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
Michael, I don't know...
Here's another place.
Um.
People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.
I have a copy of your key.
And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
Go ahead and just read the frosting.
That's a realistic time line.
You���re telling me!
Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
Cats don't make butter.
I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
Burgers.
���But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark���s getting out of my car. He���s a good boy, does whatever I say.
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That���s not true.  Just give me another chance.
Inventor of the cotton gin.
Store only has three employees.
[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
Oh, we do. So we���ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
Nothing.
Oh, don���t worry. They���ll get got.
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
[singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
We thought that she was you.
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...
[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.
It's complicated.
Where?
Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
[scores] Yes!
[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
Hey David.
In your office? [in Michael's office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
You don't have email on your phone.
Like Angela in accounting.
For five years I���ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it���s time for me to just let that thought go. It���s kind of painful, but it���s also freeing in a way. Now it���s all about my instincts.
He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
Way to go man, Jan's really hot.'
Hey. Come on, buddy. Let���s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don���t compare. When you���re with the R-O-L-F, you���re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
Question.
Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant
Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
[running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
Sounds fair to me, David.
Well... it's my own fault.
Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.
F. Alright, what's the damage?
There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
Like in a cup?
[reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.'
You're the one who trained me, Michael.
I'm on it.
But you still work for Wired, right?
Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
Look, I will not pay.
Watch this.
Eighty thousand dollars a year.
Poor hornet.
His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam���s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn���t see it, or didn���t wanna see it.
Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
Thanks, girl.
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
No need to thank me.
A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
All right.
That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
Only one way to find out.
[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
Salad.
I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]
He went over your head to go behind your back.
Why would Michael give you one before me?
I'm pumped!
Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
You���re not getting my clients! Nice try.
No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
What for? We haven���t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren���t deep fried, right?
What do you think I am saying to you?!
Good old Mose. [laughing]
It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
Come on.
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
No.
You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.
How is he gonna have grandkids?
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
Great.
I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
What are you looking at?
All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]
Okay, I���m gonna need you to print it out.
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
Don't do anything rash!
Don't lose your head.
I wish I could hire all of you.
Is that the last year the data was available?
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]
This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
Gimli.
How close?
[putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
Let me get that door for you--  [runs to open door]
First present, Oscar.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.
[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
Andy, I can't hear this right now.
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
Hello.
Good night.
Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
Seriously?
[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
Good luck, Michael.
[on the phone] ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber.
Ok.
Give me it. I am not.
Ok, give that back to me.
Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah!
It's in the name.
I will.
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file]
Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
Shhh.  Don't be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle]  ...oh no.
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...
Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Not now, Temp.
Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
Wait, canine AIDS?
Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
And who had your office?
Well, it���s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
No it is not.
[sighs] Sixty - forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I'll drive.
Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
And then if I want...
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
Ow! God!
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]
Aren't they magnificent?
Hello, spoiled little baby, [to a watermelon] in your fancy brand name stroller.  Mmm, I wonder if it's as safe as they say it is.  Oh, look, a curb.  Uh oh, let's see what happens... [lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.  My parents left me beside the road.  I crawled home.
Okay.
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
[sighs and picks up Michael's empty suitcases]
Did you do her?
That was your idea.
Steak. Rare.
[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
Hello.
[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?
Got it.
You���ll always have the upper hand, when you���ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
Doesn't matter.
Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
[tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!
Assistant regional manager.
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
[entering office] What's going on?
Wake up! [Cathy screams]
You're twenty minutes late!
Pull over!
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
[on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?
He doesn't even know that I do that.
[salutes] Thank you, Michael.
Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
I'm ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
Told you.
I volunteered for this job.
What? Come on.
[talking over Michael] Yes.
Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam's shoulders] You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
The perfect girl for me would be Konikotaka. She has the most amazing story. She was orphaned at age 10 when both her parents were assassinated, and she was taken in by a wealthy, but very cruel, businessman. So she practiced aikido in secret for years until she could avenge the death of her parents. She's also a survivor of monster rape.
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
What is wrong with
Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
It's close.
I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
This is the lake!
What will you do?
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...
There���s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
Oh, that's funny.
You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...
I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
Damn.  [thinks]  I'll try Brookstone.
Thank you.
No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
I do not respect her, but I will go.
Come on!!
Your clients. They're all mine.
No questions.
Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
He doesn't like it.
Yes.
One minute ago.
It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
It's by the ream?
Dwike?
Vietnam sounds.
The target-- it���s Oscar, isn���t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?
Thanks so much Earl.
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
What are you doing?
So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
There is no way that hurt.
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah!  Aa-aaah! [throws it ahead of the car, it goes for a while and then is stopping]  It's a hardy stroller. [takes watermelon out of stroller, holds it up to show camera] Maybe it's safe!
No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
How ya feeling, better?
It's a statement of fact.
With all my heart.
Who are you?
Oh, no!
You could ask for an extension.
Exactly.
An ���X.���
In a way it���s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they���ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I���ll have a grandson.
OK.
Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
To socialize.  And inform.
Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.
Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
Really?
Fire hazard.
Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
Merry Christmas.
I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.
Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
We need to talk!
That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
I got floor.
Coolio.
[straightens Andy's tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
It did, it did.
Jackpot.
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
Accept it, why would he come back?
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Well, we���re both just kinda learning as we go, aren���t we?
The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.
Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
Ghaaa!
Good evening.
Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
Hey Jimmy, what's up?
Yep. He'll be fine.
Well, I���m the one offering the job.
Don't make me fire you.
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Of course.
Who's doing the presentations?
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
Toby...
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
Oh, yeah. Yes!
Okay, just shut it.
Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
Thank you. [everyone begins to leave]
You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
[scoffs] The boss isn't funny.
I am a Sheriff's Deputy.
You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
Sure. That'd be fine.
Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
Just a chocolate shake, chocolate sprinkles.
Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.
Okay.
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices]
Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.
Tell him to stop.
No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
Yeah.
Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you���re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.
You have it?
Mmm-hmm.
[Shakes head]
Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.
Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
Whoa. Michael.
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
Very close.
Oh, you think they���re my only friends? I���ve got way more friends than that, and they���re all better than the losers who work here.
Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
This is not a test! Can you leave?!
Dwight...
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
Right?
I'm thirsty!
How about Scrantonstrangler666.
You liked it!
Just act natural. [grunts]
Toby...
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here���s something. Who would eat who in an ���Alive��� situation. No... that can���t be it.
Don't you dare! Andy!
[begins playing recorder]
[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.'
[whispers] I���d love to invest.
Awesome!
I���ll stall him. Go!
What is your name, sir?
My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.
Really?
I don't follow.
Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]
The leads are in?
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
Take six.
Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!
Well ���
You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
It's a common question.
One...
No, Michael.
Very excited?
Battlestar Galatica.
And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.
Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
Yes.
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Can I be team manager?
It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
What?
Come on!
Ryan.
Okay, let's go.
[finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.
Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here.
You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?
Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].
Thank you.
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
That's debatable.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
YEAH!
No. Phyllis, you're not...
While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
Losers.
No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.
Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
Get out of my way. Huh!
Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
No, I have not.
The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
Guilty!
You would?
Tootenbacher.
Hold your breath.
So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
You didn't poison me, it's just stress.
Andy.
[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
[whispering] I want some of those pills.
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger���s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
No.
Two forms of ID, please.
Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]
[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
Hello.
Sorry.
[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
I will poison your food.
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Pam.
Thank you very much.
What?
In the ocean.
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.
No, it's... involves the photograph.
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over.  I'm sorry.
You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
The White Pages.
Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
Woohoo!
We could do it in the warehouse.
Not true. And if they did, they couldn't because I'm password protected.
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
[sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
Well played.
Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
Yes.
Are you saying you invented paper?
Checks out.
Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
I put everything back in the vending machine.
That goes directly to the tester.
Yeah!
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
Stop giggling.
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
You can���t have someone murdered.
That's a very good record.
[shuts door on him] Great.
Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]
They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
[throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
Thank you. I���m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
Pam, I'll help you.
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
This is where I saw that deer last week.
I'm only going to ask you this once. Are you part of an alliance?
I don't ... have no idea.
Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That���s it? Oh, that���s great. That���s like a five second delay.
Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?
No.
We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
Take me to his house.
Assistant team manager?
Which we can't know.
[whispers] Coolio.
[looks to Angela]
PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Jan knows paper.
I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
Don���t be an idiot. It���s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you���ve been here. That���s the max.
He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
This interview is over. I'll let you know.
Yes.
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
Look at that one.
How dare you all attack him like this.
It���s by the tenderloin.
Dumatril!
What is?
Everybody!
Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
Thank you Michael.
Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
Damn It!
So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
I...
I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now.  She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
But you work tomorrow.
Hey, how's it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
Damn it!
[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Now, for the last time, I���d like a side salad with balsamic.
Why are you looking at my forehead?
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
Damn it. God!
Yeah, you know me.
I date Indian girls.
Oh, thank you.
[scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch]
Perfect casting, right?
If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
Why's he talking to Holly?
Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
[sighs]
Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!
Uh-huh.
Oh. Okay. Fine. Well done.
Okay, I���m a woman. [high voice] I���m a woman. Good?
Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
I....
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.
Parley, my office, five minutes.
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?
And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
No.
Nine and three-quarters.
Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
Man, what is taking Toby so long?
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
I heard you say ���well��� the first time.
[with conviction] Start the party.
It���s him! Do something! Get out!
Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.
What did you say?
[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
[whispering] He's my best customer.
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
It's only Meredith.
I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
Mmm.  [nods]
Oh, that's funny.  MICHAEL!
[Bus pulls into lot] Bring it in!
It's not locked, gimme that...
I know...
What's going on in here?
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]
He says, 'No!' Boom!
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Is that a sumo suit?
Oh, no. What?
I hope there will be management parables.
Yes.
Those are fighting words.
I do!
Don't do it [lobs something at Michael]
Door. Chair. It���s about Phillip.
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm]
OK you are useless.
Okay.
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.
But you're the one who picked today.
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
Dear God in heaven.
It���s a root you idiot.
To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that���s what working at a paper company���s all about!
Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
They are now.
Definitely.
Next suggestion.
You're thinking of a chicken.
I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]
Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.
[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.
Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo!
You got this kosher certified?
Ahh-chaa!
Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
Anything else?  Flint...
That's an exaggeration.
This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'
Yes, Michael.
Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
I know.
No.
I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring.
Is this Jan?
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
I'm gonna save you!
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
Danny Cordray is the worst.
Hmm?
Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
Welcome.
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
Aaaaaaaa!
Jim, this is hardly the time.
Good.
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
David. Can I just do one thing while you���re making this announcement and then I���ll never, ever do it again?
What about you?
Does it have a deck?
Mm, great cake.
Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing 'Centerfold.'] They might be listening to us.
Yes? What is the meaning of this?
Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
[Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
[imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls]
That's an excellent analogy.
Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
Hey, temp.
Mmm. That���s a good��� question. 300 times��� [Jim hangs up] 180��� Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
It's a mini-briefcase.
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
[hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don���t see them so I think we���re good.
You don't keep a diary.
No holding.
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
It���s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I���d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
Oh Pam.
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
And who is this 'the' Steve Nash?
No!
Erin [eerie voice] Erin...
Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
No.
Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]
You're the stupid one.
Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
Interesting choice...
Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they���re protecting America���s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day���s security codes. Something that���s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It���s not the KGB, but it���s a start.
Mm-hmm.
Jim. Definitely.
Like hell you are.
Think!
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
Then looks like we have a deal��� Son [holds up a suit identical to his]
Aaah!
Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool.
Remember what we had Larry?
Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
Hey shut up.  You're dead.
Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Oh! [collapses]
No, I like Meredith.
Not my urine.
Michael!  What's wrong?
Nash.
Saturday.
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
You okay, Robert?
Right...
Alright.  I'll call you, kid.
No. [typing on keyboard]
That's what she said.
Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
I know how it happened.
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]
I can���t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
You know what this is?
Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
I'm on it!
I'll do a shot, Michael.
It is so on!
Are you socialist?
It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
Yeah, trust me.
I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.
That... that's impossible.
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
What kind of mileage does this baby get?
So we're choosing...
Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.
Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
[wails arms] You know, selling, typing, dialing.
That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
Of course there���s a costume! [laughs] ��Oh, this is gonna be great. There���s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
What-
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
I am a farmer Angela.
Women look like white slaves.
Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
No! Really?
Not now! Private time!
[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
He's heading downtown.
I want a truce.
No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He���s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He���s my tribe.
If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
That is true.
It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
Ugh.
What are you-
I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.
That's because they're easy!
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Really?
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
[Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.
Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!
I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
Yeah.
[walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
You'll see. Here we go.
Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
[from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
That's my client.
[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.
Not so fast.
Drink it!
Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
Fence with a hole in it..
Apparently.
[Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa....
We're not allowed to use the baler.
No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
I'll do--
I'm being sabotaged.
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
Hope to see you soon.
Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
We did it, we did it. I love you.
Yes!
What? Ooh!
A thousand times more.
Oh, please.
Gabe? You don't know?
Well...
So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
Ow.
Psssh, no.
It's actually better this way.
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
David.
What?
What? What's so wierd?
[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.
Yes.
Fine. Five times. [signs contract]
Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.
Text went through.
Yes! Ha!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
This conversation has two items on the agenda.
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ���em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
You���re bad.
[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.
Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!
People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.
Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.
Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
I can't-
[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.
Talk me through an appendectomy.
Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.
I'll be back, I mean...
[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.
Yes.
What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news���thing.
Thank you.
The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
Some of these kernels have crowned.
Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
He used to fight dogs.
[scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
I'll do it! I always say, 'You want something done right? Ask Dwight.' Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
Good. They good?
[Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans]
Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
Michael.
I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
Wow!
OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
Really? That���s interesting. ���Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who���s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
[sighs]
Woo-hoo.
You wanted to see me?
[agreeing] Mm.
Bildenkinder.
Thank you.
Aaaarrhh!  [kicks over Christmas tree]
You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
Yes!
Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
Hey buddy.
He'll die.
Seven...
The Dundies!
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
Calves. Calves all the way.
Thank you, Michael.
What?
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
Exactly. Yes.
Yes.
I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
$200.00
You did this for me? [camera pans to 'Welcome Back Oscar' sign]
...the fact...
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
Yow!
All right.
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
Oh.
Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
Okay.
There's one more suggestion.
He was dead the whole time.
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
Fax this for me.
Hi Daryl. I���m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
Look, we're twins.
Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
Mmhmm.
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
But the little cars go in the compact spot
[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
[finds shoe box] Ooh.
I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
Pssht.
We had already applauded.
I insist.
No.
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
Hey monkey, what's up?
[taking pen back] Gimme that.
You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
Jim --
It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
RAHHH!!!!!!!
Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Then we meet at the Denny's...
Super 8?
You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
Hello? Hello?
Probably. [walks away with beans]
Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
What else does it look like?
Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
Okay.
Please, I can double your pace.
Breathing. Is that you?
OK. Good night Ryan.
You're welcome.
Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
Would that be such a bad thing?
How do you know that?
Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
He looks like your twin.
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
We gotta see what he's got.
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
Dripping on me.
The eyes are the groin of the head.
I am cool.
[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!
[lets go] Good morning.
Ed was decapitated.
God.  Where is Jim?
Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?
He doesn't even want to go.
Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
Good.
N-no there's not.
No! No!
It means they are not expanding.
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
What's that?
Right. Highways or surface roads?
Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
Yes!
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Damn it!
Kind of.
He's not kidding.
[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
No, it was not!
In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
I do not!  I do not say 'Hi' Pam!
What?
Come on.
Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
There is no shower.
Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
He���s like a manatee. Ready? Let���s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley���s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.�� No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'
You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.
I don't get that, I don't understand that.
I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
Now what?
I'm talking about... hmmm.
Very impish.
I���ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I���m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
[at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side.
Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound]
Jim.
Taste good too.
Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
Yes.
[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
[groans] Stop moving!
Loyalty.
Okay, I just...
Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.
Hey, monkey, how you doing?
Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.
Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.
Sh-what?
Where?
Oh.
[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
You successfully backed down the mob!
[changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
...Okay.
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
You're back. [surveys Andy] And you're disgusting.
pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.
Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
[Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, 'Kind of.'
Hustle!
[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
Thank you.
Okay. Fine.
No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
Aye.
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So���[clears throat]
If you want to tell me -
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
I smell mold.
Did you get your tickets?
Bow down before Recyclops.
Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder.
Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
I know you did.
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
What?
Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]
Yes, Sensei!
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
She's sleeping with you?
I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
Wow. Late every day this week.
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]
I'm not good at jokes.
Leave the keys.
No, okay.
And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.
No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]
[falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
Will end completely!
Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
I won't.
You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.
Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and���
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
You don't work here! You're not Jim!
Iris, thank you so much for having me.
That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
Yeah, Meredith.
Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
Cell phone?  Charger?
Consider it?
Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers]
Torture.
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
What would you have done? Been manager?
[to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
Yep, he's lying.
Get in the back.
Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
Hi, Mr. Bart.
Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh��� No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
Quiet you.
Your foot?
...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
Smart baby. That���s the most flavorful bond.
Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
Oh, man, am I a woman?
This is exciting! You���re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
[reading the note with the gay-dar]  'Hope this helps.  -Jim'  Nice!
K. I brought cheese too.
[clears throat] Knock, knock.
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
[clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.
Eh.
Ready? What do you think?
Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
What does it say?
For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
I can���t get it out. Try again!
[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...
Got it?
So you're taking a personal day?
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
You are the future!
It's just for family.
In. I'm hungry.
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.
Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
Might get ugly.
No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!
You got a better way?
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
Just for fun?
Turn it around. Turn it around.
Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Such a chorus girl.
Awesome.
It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
You're good.
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
No, no. Give me the steam.
You've done more then you can possibly know.
[looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this.
I do, I have to go.
Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
That is impossible.  Unless you mean gonorrhea.
You're not on
I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
American Idol? What? No.
[Mose drops cage and runs] Mose!
Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.
You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't...
K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight���s desk]
We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
None of your business.
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
[standing up] Get out.
D-W-I-G-H-T.
No, you���re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ��L--
Oh��� really.
Daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare���s milk?
Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...
How much do you have?
Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]
A few of the ground rules?
Just the one window?
Okay.  Fine.
Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other���s minds. You���re trying to give your wife this job.
We have more houses to visit.
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
What?
Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
Drop this one. Abort.
I am not bluffing!
Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
No, no, don't, don't tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
He/she/it throat rips.
Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
Robert.
(takes out bag) 40. Always.
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
That is a damnable lie. I love women.
I...
English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.
Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]
Yeah.
What's the exact square footage.
My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
[Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!
Daraas!
Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
Oh, great. He���s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
Good! Okay. Flirt away.
[on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman!
No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
Define scorched earth policy.
But that's illegal.
She said she was only sleeping with me.
Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?
Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
Michael, wait. Let me go.
What?
Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.
He hung up?
I got a knock-knock joke.
Yeah!
No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
I'm doing my job.
This is stupid! Cut.
Oh. Terrible idea.
[snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.
I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.
Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.
Yes.
You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
Hey! It's on the list, everybody.
The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'
Oh, man.
[waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael's office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this?  Jan?
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
Who? Dave Barry?
Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
This is a bus transfer.
I'll call you back.
It's from both of us.
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
I think I saw it!
No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?
Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
Go. Push!
Watch this part, okay?
Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
I was aware that you were speaking.
No you can't do that.
There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.
Gonna get it?
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
Stanley.
Silver medal.
[struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Bull... [bleep] [clears throat] Sorry.
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
[fires tranquilizer gun twice]
Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
Yes.
The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
Yes.
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]
[smiles] That's two things.
Please, come back.
That���s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
Marching or garage?
I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
Three to four hours.
Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]��� Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]
Yes!
It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
You know it.
It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
Come on.
I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
Maybe you should.  Whatever.
Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]
Sorry.
Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
Impossible, I love the law.
Where are we going?
I don't know...
No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Thank you Sandra!
Wha...
Eh, it's not worth it.
Hoist him aloft. C���mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]
Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
[tearful laugh]. Get out of my way.
100%.
Power.
I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
Uh-huh.
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
Don���t worry, it���s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It���s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
There it is. [everyone applauds]
Don't be mad, it is a business trip.
Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I���ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
Anyone else?
No, you're not because I spent hours on it.
Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
Hey.
I have an old barn!
Aye aye, Captain.
Let's go!
It was his birthday, just turned three. So���
Five minutes exactly.
What?
[to camera] Same thing.
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Great.
Yes!
You have information about the sex predator?
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
Hey.
The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
You mean, like a ham?
Stay out of this, you!
That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
What?
Really shove it.
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It���s gonna be fine. It���s gonna be fine. There���s plenty of Pyramids.
Alright.
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
[standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement...
Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
Let���s just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice]
C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
Angela...
You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
Monkey. [kisses her]
Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
Cherry Pie, Warrant.
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
OK, where does it hurt?
As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
Okay! Come on!
Let's see yours.
No.
[handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
I'll order you some cranberry juice.
Hey buddy, so every-
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
I missed you Kevin.
You apologize right now.
Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim���s desk while he���s away in Philly. Finally I���ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It���s like, ���Really, Jim? You don���t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.��� Wow.
Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
Where are you?
Me.
I have crossbows.
And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
Hurl your feces.
And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they���re out of the house.
Mose, bags! Now!
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
What?
Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
I hadn't noticed.
Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Are you nuts?
Take a stand!
Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
[sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
You're wearing loafers!
Okay, here���s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can���t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
Give me the punch card.
Hoist his shank on three.
Oh I did. I did.
If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
Yes!
700 and one penny.
My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
It's small, I know.
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
You wanted to see me?
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
You���re working for ���Stumpany��� too?
[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
Hello, Jan.
Great, right up there.
And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
Which is you' is not a sentence.
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
Huh?!
OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
you said to just...
[leaving] We'll bill you.
Michael?
I want him to have all the urine he needs.
I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
He --
Shotgun weddings.
We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
Look, I have no problem with women. It���s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don���t lie about your shoulders!
Nice, very nice.
It's my car now.
No.
No. She needs her rest again.
You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]
[kicks the car] Unh! Scratch.
Here, here��� Just���
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
No.
Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you get anything good?
Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
Classy.
Go ahead.
OK, what's up?
Dwight Schrute.
I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
���Higher than numbers go.��� The ceiling above accounting!
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
[surprising Kelly] Aha!
Euughh��� Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present��� Hey.
When? When did he tell you? Today?
You're lying. We didn't win.
Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
Jim talked too much.
Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
Let's get the party started.
[impatient sigh]
Yes.
You already said deal.
Stupid!
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]
Well, yeah.
How?
[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
Not now!
This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
[laughing] Boom!
Yeah, you don���t want Italian. You���ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you���ll be doing life in Rikers Island.
Stay out of this, you!
Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
Answer me this, though.
Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
Don���t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
I have to go to the hospital.
I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]
Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
The Crow.
[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]
Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
Aah!
[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
Wrestle him to the ground.
They are unrelated.
Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]
Thank you, Sensei.
Yeah, right.
Oh, god, this again? You���re Stinky.
Point it towards the store, idiot!
Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
Michael, can you explain?
Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]
Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
I just don't get it.
For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
Amazing.
[duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]
I don't even know what to say.
Yep.
I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
A bat! Impressive...
Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby]
I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
You have to tell me.
Yes, Monkey.
[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
Let���s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
You did?
That suit is amazing.
Yeah!
What do you think?  You've got an hour.
I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her]
Michael?
One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
She called you D?
Jim!
just drink a lot of water.
Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself.
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]
Saleswoman has a vagina.
Kevin! Do more stupid faces.
I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
Oh!
I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
Gah!
Hey, it just takes one!
She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
Does it have a deck?
Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I���m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
[agreeing with Shirley] Thank you.
Calm, please
Yes.
You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
Angry.
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
Well today���s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
You did this, didn't you?
I like where you're going with this. Continue.
Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
It's a job interview, not a flea market.
Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet]
This is not at drill!
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
Oh. God.
[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
I���d like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]
I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie���?  Lick the spoon?
Shove it through! Break it!
Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
Ok
Really?
The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
Of course I saw it.
Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
[to Nellie] I told you.
This is smaller than your old place.
Care for a piece of chocolate?
Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
[on the phone] Yes, Howard Gruber, please.
It's not the greatest one either...
Nice.
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
Michael, I would like to be the elf.
That laugh is so infectious.
Where? Dark side or light side?
The fire guy! The fire guy!
Try influenza.
Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
Why is she marrying Andy?
We?'
Um, what about you?
(Bleep)
Eager.
Did you enjoy your lunch?
Hallowed ground.
[in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
OK!
No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
N... it's complicated.
Don���t!
Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
Well...
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
Pam!
Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
You don't like the Beatles?
I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
I see Esther's back in town.
Your path from obesity begins right here!
Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.
Damn it! Perfect answer, again.
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]
What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
[tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo!
Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
Jim. Look I���m eating you.
This has to do--
Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
[nods to camera]
So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
Does he have access to their medical records?
Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus?
I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
[Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
[drinks] Mmmmm...
Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]
No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
Hey monkey.
What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]
Come on. I'll drive.
Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.
I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
Kung-fu movies!
Not the living in fear, that's new.
I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
[struggling] Ahh! I can't-
We are going to have two men's rooms.
Yes! We advance to the next round!
There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but���
Yeah.
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
Good. [Pam overhears]
I call for a refold!
Alright. First thing in the morning then.
Smells like it.
No.
One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
Did you say Karen?
After you.
Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Y el accento, donde are you from?
Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!
That doesn���t sound crazy, Jim. That���s the sanest thing I���ve ever heard.
It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]
[in Jim's office]  Sign this.
Oh, no.
[Jo leaves] I, uh...
That's great.
Wow! Lot of calories.
Uh, duh.
Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot.
That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!
Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
You know how I feel about IHOP.
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.
I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
Humans are terrible for the environment.
But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.  [bites into the sandwich half, chews]  Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
Spin move.
Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
I sa- [Andy honks his horn]
I was just showing her my belt.
No.
I was just jogging.
Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?
Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
Smasher? No, where���d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city���s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
Jim, get him a water.
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?
[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
[raises hand] Here.
Got it.
What?
And their king bee.
It���s all right. Andy approved it.
Done.
Uh. [eats antacids]
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
Okay, who moved my desk?
That means ye, Plop!
What kind of filing?
Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
Good night.
Aaaaaaaa!
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?
What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?
Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
Wash your hands, Kevin.
300 and one penny.
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
Hey. [shuts door] Is everything okay?
[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
Yeah.
Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
I'm kneading it!
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
You are kidding me!
[to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here���s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]
Motel 6? Best Western?
It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
Thank God.
Yeah. It's practical.
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.
Yeah!
Uh huh.
Mm.
[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
Oh, nothing much. What's up with you?
That's a common swindlers trick.
You promised us whales. These are worms.
Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on]
Are you going?
Come -- come with me.
I'm fine, I'm totally fine.
I've said too much.
Does that include the garage?
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.
Hey, what are you listening to?
It is not a B and B.
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
Huh? You like that?
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]
He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.
Keep the wing flaps.
Please? Please, Pam?
Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ���I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt��� unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?
Yeah! [laughing]
We measured it once...
The power source.
Final touch-ups.
[gets up from chair] Write legibly people.
OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
You're back.
Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.
Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
Hey.
[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.
But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
Have you seen Erin?
Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...
[talking over Michael] God, what a steal.
Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
We heard it was called red-vining.
Well, I���ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly]
You're a secretary! What do you know?
You know, you���re right! We hadn���t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]
OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]
And anoth���
From when he recommended me to replace him.
Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]
It's time.
No way. What if I meet someone?
No, you know what? You do it.
There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
Okay, okay.
[as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.
You are out of order.
Yes.
People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
Ok. First impressions?
Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
[to group] OK, let���s look at some ties.
Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
Andy I���m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
I was here first.
No.
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.
Did you even read the memo?
Oh come on.
Wing.
Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!
I could, but I just don���t feel like it loser.
And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
It's not fair.
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
Who is Justice Beaver?
I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
[whispers] Oh D.
Yeah, do tell.
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]
What?
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Should I get water or donuts?
Oh. I got it.
[looks over and sees hole in his present]  Crap.  [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up]  Come here you.
Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']
She's not here, Jim.
Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
Oh I am. In my own words.
Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
It���s moments away. Just stay here!
A quilt.  Depression quilt?
That's fair.
Alright, move it.
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
What?
It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow]
Sorry.
Take me to Robert.
Wha ��� what is this supposed to be?
Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
You needed to speak to me?
And I have to say your leadership...
...to consolidate power.
Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]
Yes, exactly!
Sounds like a plan.
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick]
Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
State your business!
Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
I got it.
Yeah.
No.
[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
Blah.
[sobbing] Thank you.
[playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
[trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's 'Let's Get Physical' starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
What!
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
None of your business.
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
I'm gonna say 30.
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
That's right.
Oh, worker's comp, my ass!
Where did you see it?
Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
I'm just saying...
In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
Oh my���! Oh d���! Oh, how did���? [gasps] Huhhhhh!
Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
Michael.
This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
What box?!
Oh.
[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.
[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
Put your fingers here.
I'm cashing in the favor.  Fire him.
Oh.
Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
What's going on?
No. Jim, come on.
Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
What are you mumbling about?
Whassup!
So you excited?
OK
Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
That-
Come on, let's go. Take a seat.
[coughing] It's still stinky.
[voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
Hey. Enjoy your new clump.
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
Really funny, Michael!
Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!'
So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
It is the situation that we are in now.
[applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door]
Shut up. That's impossible.
He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.
I hate her too.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
What���s a book? [giggles]
Oh my god.
BAT!
[moans] Scranton rules! [sprays Silly Spray]
[giggles]
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
And, well, I don't see my co-workers--
These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
You wanna eat, don't you?
Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
No, hmmm... that's still...
[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
No, Pam.
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
I had a tickle in my throat.
Okay.
I'm not answering it.
[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
And not come through for you?
Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
Andy is complicating things.  But I'm not worried.  This will only up my game.
No, he shouldn���t.
Jim!
You think I don���t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I���ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne���er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don���t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
I'm gonna with the python.
Okay?
Thank you.
She loves me.
Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
No, no. No spoilers. Please.
Jeez! What���s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
But this isn���t interim manager. No. It���s Dwight K. Schrute��� [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's...
Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
I am not a liar.
Fine.
Oh my goodness.
Death to Toby!
Her name?
How ya doin'?
Okay that's-
Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
What? You?
No, [mumbling] I don't know.
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
Just a possibility.
[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
You choose!
He's very, very handsome.
Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
Uh, bumper's sagging.
[throws hard, Jim doesn���t catch] Nice catch.
Take a bowl and pass it down.
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you���re ever in the area, you���ll always have a place to stay���in my barn.
No.
I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
You don't want to know.
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
Oh, they're forming an alliance
I'm not closing the door.
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
That���s it.
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
[clears throat] 'I state my regret.'
[outside] Come on, hurry up you guys!
Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could���ve choked so many people by now.
Coolio. Coolio.
[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.
How you doing, Jordan?
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
[applause] Oh yes! Yeah!
And they said it couldn���t be done. Boom!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
No, not me.
Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
That's where they remove the uterus.
I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
Oh, that's my last one.
What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who���s the father of her child?
On an innocent baby.
[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
What?
What?
I have to see these shoes.
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
Dumatril.
Get lost.
Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
We're here. [gets out of the car]
You want rabies? Be my guest.
Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
...and then we compare notes.
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
Does it specify which windshield?
Well rested.
Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ���Scranton Mimeograph Corp?��� I don���t think we���re doing business with them any time soon. That���s odd. ��A letter from Robert Dunder. ���A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.��� The Holy Grail.
Apology rejected.
Where were you yesterday after work?
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
Hey, IT guy.
Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
No, don���t say it. You���re fired! You���re both fired!
What?
I want to do this.
[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling]  Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance.
Right.
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
Oh, dear God in heaven.
No way!
No no no.
[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
Push!
Security deposit. That's been-
I never said it was better than an iPod.
Eel fishing.
Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
I just saved your life. You���re welcome!
No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
But then you wouldn't have me here.
I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That���s Lloyd.
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
Jeb, my brother.
Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
Get your clouds right.
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]
It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
Oh, I like it.
Uh-huh.
Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
Clark has no chance. I mean, he���s up against my buddy Rolf, for God���s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ��� he���ll make you laugh so hard, you���ll puke your pants.
Quiet, you.
It's a good market. Higher volume.
For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp.
Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.
I know. That���s not why I���m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]
Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist]
[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
No! I don't want natural!
Horse Boat.
You're the best.
Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
Michael.
oh���
People love beets.
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane���s coming.  I suppose you���re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
[removes glasses] I am the bait.
Michael.
Don't make me pre-fire you.
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
Get your foot behind the yellow line.
When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier���s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
What are you saying?
I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
Seal it off.
What?
He turned over my...
Oh, yes.
Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
Dammit! [hangs up]
My eyes!
Wow.
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
Yeah, Andy.
[stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.
No.
Really, that's your real name?
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
Oh.
Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
Crisis averted.
Waste of time.
Ok, what is going on here?
Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
[on the phone] Humor works in...
Ok, what are they?
Woohoo! Yes!
Woo! Okay!
Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
No trades.
Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
No, I can't... I ca...
You���re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we���ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
I got it. I got it.
Kiyah!
Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
[scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
It's about Michael.
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Waste of time.
The pressure!  The pressure!
Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...
I could have stopped him.
[in bullhorn] Pull over!
I don't know.
...noted.
Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]
I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
I don���t know, what do you mean?
From Jim.
You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
Screwed.
I'll ask you a question.
Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
[tests smoke detector] Good.
Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
Michael! Michael!
[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
Argh!
Made copies of it-
Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
You don't know?
[fires tranquilizer gun at Stanley]
Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
Really? Oh... Then here we are.
No... way! Yeah!
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
Oh, I'm OK.  I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
Fumble! Yaaah!
...never been lower!
No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
[puts his grandmother���s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]
Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
Vagina and-
No need we can just check the security tapes.
And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Yeah.
I will know.
Yes, you did.
See ya later, Trevor.
It can���t be nothing.
Toby.
-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then.'
So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
He went to Gabe behind your back.
Ok.
Hey, Jan.
No.
Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I���ll be right back.
I need you to hose my aunt.
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
��� 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up]
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
A loyal, but bungling apostle.
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]
Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.
Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
Stop forgetting things.
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
What is it?
Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
I think it was Creed.
Yes!
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose]
What's your blood type?
You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
Are you sure that's going to work?
[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
Inbwit? Yes.
OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
[whispers to Clark] We don���t get along.
New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let���s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let���s go.
Kevin! Doesn't apply.
Why?
Just slip it off my���Slip it off my hips.
OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
Really?
What were you doing in there?
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Unlikely.
Thank you, Angela.
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
No. No.
I really don't think so.
Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
Thanks old man.
Just a formality.
-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
I'm not.
Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
We don't take debit cards, anyway.
Reply it!
What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
[same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...
You apologize to me right now.
Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha���You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
What's so funny?
What you doing?
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
[Holds his finger to Jim's lips] Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim]
Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
Move to the exits!
I'm not a barbarian.
God!
What are you writing about me?
It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
This is how business...
I���d have to get some more wire and string, but it���s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You���re gonna watch me right?
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package]
Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
To keep secrets from my computer.
First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
[opens eyes wide in total surprise]
What is it?
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
They are either going to say yes... or no.
And it's-
This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it���s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It���s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It���s for a disorder of the mind.
You were making me do things that were not all right.
Ok, Pam, thanks.
[sighs]
Okay?
Hey, did you SMS text message me?
Damn it! Jim!
Okay.
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
350 and one penny.
I am nigh!
They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
Come down right away!
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.
You're the stupid one.
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
Then make him pitch to you.
It does, but still no.
Yes.
Obesity-caused illnesses.
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.
[whispering] Michael.
Hee-heeding this right now.
I'm thirsty.
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
They might be listening to us
Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
Like an AIDS test?
Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
Always. [runs off]
You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
You should go.
Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
Wait, what?
He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
I can't say [clearinng throat noise]?
Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!
That���s true.
Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It���s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]
[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]
What?
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
No! You���re not helping, Trevor!
Maybe over a beer after she���s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
I���m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don���t quit your day job.
Just admit you lost track of time.
Cool.
[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
I have.
Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone]
Wha���Yes. Your attention. Uh because��� No that is all. [walks out]
Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
Hi Michael!
And she called it nuts?
I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
Make way, nope, inspect me.
[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.
That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
Head towards the exits.
[whispers] Don't let-shh!
You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn���t even know it. I���ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
Yes.
Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
Oh, yeah.
What?
Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Goodbye.
Then I will.
Three...
My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.
Ah-luh-luh, a little comment.  Muh.
Listen to me! I love you! And I don���t care that Phillip���s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] ���Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.���
It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
[lifts cup up with toes]
How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
It's a sales call.
There���s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
You've got to tell Andy about us.
I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
I will do my voodoo.
Can you give me a second, sir.
Don't say cow- Ugh.
Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
Hey, hey. Easy.
I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]
You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
No.
I've got the key.
I, Jim Halpert...
That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
Do you have the Sharpie?!
We all have a hero in our heart.
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
You know what?
Mm-hmm.
No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
No problem.
Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
What's going on, Michael.  Talk to me.
I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I���m finished, it���s over.
You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief]
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
Troy!  What are you doing here?
Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
Like who?  Who doesn't know?
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
Ohhhhhh!
Yes?
Let's table that. So, temp... You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar.
Please.
The warmth will lure people inside.
You���re welcome.
We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, ���perfect pork anus��� which I don't mean.
I'll make you two tapes.
You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]
Alien
Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
Jim, Michael's office.
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Here they come.
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
Thanks for inviting me along.
Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
Ready?
I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
Right now!
I know you did it!
Let's go.
[still off screen] Carol had a mustache?
I checked it more than once.
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
I was trying to go-
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
What? Are there two suns?
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.
To be burned!
Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
It's not what you think.
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
What can I do better?
Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ��� What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
It's the ladies' room.
That���s really rude.  I don���t tell you hurricanes suck even though it���s true.
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?
That's good enough for me. [exhales again]
Get...
I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
Need any help?
You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
Little of this, little of that.
Great. Get the plate number.
I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
I work with Michael.
...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's]
Please, don't.
Ah, much, ok.
Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
Still an important position. Still a chief.
Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder]
It's a divet...
That doesn't make any sense.
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
Jack Nicholas.
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
Vamping.
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
What does it look like?
Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?
What a courageous venture.
That was the sick one, right?
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Really?  'Cause Ryan says so?
And I���ve never seen you go to work, ever.
As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]
Rule two: we stop at nothing.
[on the phone]  Hey, what's up, kid?
Okay.
Happy birth moment, Michael.
[Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
What are you doing?
...their own children.
[to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
You think Jim���s lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.
It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.
I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.'
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
I
If you fall in love with her.
Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
Oh, yes, we do.
Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.
Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
I think she's efficient.
Oh give me a break.
Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
You're insane.
Oh, tips are expected?
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]
Ha!
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
Ryan? What does he know?
No!
That's not good.
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.
And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too 'meh' or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing 'I wear makeup'] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
[clapping] Whoo!
You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.
I have a girlfriend...
Just rock. Shh.
What?
Where did you get that mallard?
Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
What look?
Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
Did he threaten you?
[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
[to camera] Same thing.
You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
Not literally.
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
Brought it in here-
Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I���ve ever made.
Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
What? Shirts on or off?
Looks serious.
All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
[raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.
I���m sorry. I���ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
Sure.
I want that vice-presidency.
It's a terrible idea.
Come up with a statement in the next hour....
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
Do you have your money belt?
What's with the smile?
Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
Okay.
OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
All right!
Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.
Admit it. Admit it.
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
[laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh]
Michael!
[lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
No.
You never know. Better safe than sorry.
[over phone] Hey-O!
Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.
Don't be an idiot.' Changed my life.
It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
[fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they���re not even good. Really, they���re bad. Like you and your son.
What is this?
That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
Pshh. That's a bedbug.
Do you have your card?
Do you know where we are, temp?
How did it go?
Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
Ha ha! Yeah, joke���s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
[laughs] No!
[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here���s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
[walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry.
That���s me.
[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody's found the hog maw.
When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person���s penis?
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
Aah!
TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
Okay.
Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.
Cause you���re interested in going into sales?
The democratic primaries,
Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
Stop it.
[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?
Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it���s barely three pounds.
Yeah, that'll work.
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
[interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
Sure thing.
[talking over Michael] Nice.
Thanks, Michael.
Are those real pearls?
Nametag?
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]
You took something that doesn't belong to you.
[bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
[scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet]
Kelly is the only applicant.
So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
Hiii! [kicks Michael]
Ah.
[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?
Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
No, you can stop.
Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
You just said it. You just said it.
[as elevator door closes] Hold it!
[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
Bye Pam.
Make him be quiet.
Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
Outside of work.
No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
Right, that's good, good, pursue this.
But you can say that about anything.
Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]
You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.
All right.
Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
Yes, it is. Carry on.
Yeah pretty much.
Um.
Really?
Michael...
Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
I know that's what he said.
No.
Really make one.
I got sofa. I got sofa.
What are you doing?
Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
Yeah!
Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put
Jim!
That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
Exactly.
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
Maybe that's how you die.
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
I can save the branch.
Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'IT WAS DWIGHT' written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]
[scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim���s leg.
What happened?
Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?
I was talking to myself.
Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
Good.
I can tell. I won't let you down.
No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
Believe it.
I'll try and think of one. When...
They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?
Eight minutes!
Yeah, but no nipples.
This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
Ready?!
Oh God.
Stop acting like an idiot!
Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
No, panic is warranted!
What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
Look.  She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She's a bumpkin.  Pass.
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
I saw that. That's great!
I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.
[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Troy, do you know anything about this?
[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
Guys, it wasn���t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn���t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
Prestige is ours. Okay, they���re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
There's so much more to it than that.
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
Okay.
Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
Give me the dice.
Yeah!
How's it hanging?
[stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]
You don't know what you need. Just...
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
Way to go.
Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
I think it did.
Weird.
Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
You see?
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
That!
No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what���s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you���re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
You heard me!
I think I should be there.
She should thank me.
Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute'
And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
No, you will be tested.
Where did you read that?
Michael, come on.
I do that myself now.
Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room]
Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
[on the phone] I understand.
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
[whispering] You set a date?
Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
So excited.
Oh. Of course.
Fire Jim.
Your fictitious name?
Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
[off screen] What are you guys talking about?
Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?
Yes!
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
Mi-
Come on.
Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts?
What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Yes.
No!
And Dwight.
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
No, like you.
Crowd control, directing traffic...
Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
I will never, ever let you down.
He defecated, aw.
I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
[picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
Interviewer has suspect motives.'
So why is this on your resume? [door slams]
It was Andy's idea.
Really?
Excuse me?
You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
Do it now.
The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There���s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ���the White Whale���. Look at all that sweet blubber.
He���s fine. He gets carsick really easily.
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
Visual aids.
What belt are they?
I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I'm in pain.
About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].
Yeah.
No, you're too close.
Kelly is disqualified!
It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.
Nothing. [puts down binoculars]
Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby.
Do it.
Wow!
Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Good, we have a deal?
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
With today���s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it���s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
I wanted to offer you a new position.
Angela.
Come on Clark!
Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
Mm-hmm. Good luck.
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
It was rotting.
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.
Do you own a gun?
So���
Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
[to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
What are the specs?
Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...
Her kid needs shoes, Jim!
Yes!
Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
[lying on Michael's desk] Hold me!
And your veil.
This expresses how loudly I love you.
Yes.
400 and one penny.
Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
Trees!  And where do trees grow?
I'll have a cup of a coffee.
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
I'm... discombobulated.
Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!
[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.
Thirty-two meatballs.
Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
Answer me.
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!'
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
Yes. Anything.
Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert���s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
Two charges of loitering,
Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
I need to make a sales call.  Please?
But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
That's really fattening.
You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls.  We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
Cmon.
Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin]
Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
You're welcome.
He sure left in a hurry.
I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.
Just trying to be helpful.
Not Dwight.
Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.
...I'll consider it.
With the crotch.
Come on, folks!
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
Go put them all in random order.
Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J���rg Ro���kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
I broke it.
There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.
Downsizing?
Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
[shakes fist, whispers] Yeah!
Your own paper company.
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...
I think I cut my penis on the lid!
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
Not a word.
She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.
[Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]
[at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
I'm not gonna say it.
Oh my gosh, now she's up.
I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
It's uh, it's in beta testing.
Pam.
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
You know what? I made you a cd...
That's on a need-to-know basis.
I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don���t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
[Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]
You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?
[mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.
[has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.
Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.
[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
What?
I will.
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief]
Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
Fine.
I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
OK, I'm ready.
I want to see the baby.
Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
Please Michael, please.
Oh my God, she told you?
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
What do you think history is?
Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check��� on that later today. This is my grandmother���s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother���s buttock bullet ring.
That shady grove out by Willard's pond.
He���s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
Oh my God.
The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk]
[looking pregnant] Hey Michael?
Pam, are you all right?
Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
No. [takes a drink]
[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Oh no! Jan!?  What's goin' on?
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.
I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
Michael, we have a situation.
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
Oh...
[whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.
Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]
Yeah.
Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
Michael is gone.
Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
I hit a bear.
At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
Get up off your desks!
Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.
Speaking of pimples, let���s release the BLOGGERS!
You���re really going to want the booster.
Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
[jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
Go!
First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'  Those are the money beets.
I am hardly the problem, Jim.
Mmmnnnnmmm...
K, I���m gonna need some help. Pam?
Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
Cause you're sweeter than candy.
The buyer is your sister���s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that���s an order.
Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
Yeah.
Done.
Mine was green.
Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We���re running late. Let���s get him inside.
I am trying to bring team spirit.
He wouldn't listen to me
Seven? Can I finish please?
Thank you Angela.
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
You're thinking of deer penis.
[grunts] Let���s take him���
[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
[picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall]
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
Look at him. I���ve never seen such a beautiful child.
Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel.
What were your favorite moments?
[on phone with Jim] I hope you���ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it���s time for another episode of ���Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire���.
[playing volleyball] Hit it Andy!
Hey Santa!
Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]
[pause] What?
I���m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
Gentlemen.
Well, it doesn't...
Do you mind? The men are talking.
Yeah!  Your idea.
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Okay.
Mmhmm.
Could I have a copy of one of them?
Sure.
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ��� how do I put this ��� steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Danger.
Aah!
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don���t see the point. It���s so Wall Street.
It's a lullaby.
Really?
I could never do that!
You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]
Uh, better ask Jim.
Hola, tu es une buena worker?
Make a decision.
Butter. Newborns are slippery.
More like, 'Aye, aye, General.'
Not you, Erin.
Yes.
The temp.
Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
It goes out automatically at five P.M.
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
Okay. So yeah.
Return it!  Return it now!
[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ���Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.��� [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
[shouting] Haulin' cube!
[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Creed! Come on. Stanley!
Right?
Yes, I was quilled.
Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
[picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
Come on, shooter!
Oh, just...
[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
Enter Sandman, Metallica.
What?
Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
And flexible.
No.
You had black hair and then gray hair.
Idiot.
[laughs while spray painting ���Jim is Awesome��� on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
Keep an existing...
Make-up sex. Nice!
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
Warf.
No no no the first part.
[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
Michael, what time should I be arriving?
Jim, don't interfere.
Who is the king of Prussia?
Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
It's, it's latched closed.
I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
What do you think you're doing?
Okay, okay. That's enough.
You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
It���s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we���re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
[employees chuckle] And he
Kelly?
Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
Come here. Come here.
I do. But you married my worst enemy.
Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
It worked.
Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.
Welcome to our land.
I can get you exotic meats ��� hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?
My wound hasn't healed yet.
[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
If I guess, will you tell me?
What?
[Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job.  Interested?
Right?
I knew it.
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?
[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
Three.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, Andy.
Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
[quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]
I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
I have two. White and Indian.
Christmas card list.
I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
Damn it!
I want to do it.
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
He wasn't volunteering today.
[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
No word from Michael.
Uhh-mmm [moaning]
I'm a huge fan.
Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
To intimidate my subordinates.
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
No, no, no, no! You don���t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There���s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don���t have diplomatic relations.
I can see that happening.
Yeah!
No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
My calls?
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
Let me out.
What is that?
The new guys called a sales meeting?
[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.
[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.
Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
[into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
They're still good for another week.
[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor]
Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]
So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?
And you want me to come with you.
PETA.
This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that���s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
Jethro Tull...
[innocently] How'd that get there?
Okay, get out of here.
It���s just one thing. Just let me���let me do this���
When I was asking about the leads.
Sensei, you���re not watching.
It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.
Clown paint.
Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back]
Yes.
Check out Dental?
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Mmm-hmm.
No. I���ll be damned if I���m gonna let us lose me.
STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Oh.  Meh.
Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
Alright! Uh! [Spanks himself]
Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
Just ignore him.
Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?
Fosters in the big can.
I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
Then I would bring an axe, no books.
Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]
Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!
Listen up.  Let's start... from the ground
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I'll install it on your computer.
I figured it would save time.
I���m trying to make him feel important.
No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]
Really?
I sure do.
Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
Search his things.
[coughing]
[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.
Don���t listen to him.
Can I be your representative?
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
[whispering] I don���t know. I just don���t know.
Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
About what?
Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
Also, it's icky back there.
I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!
Andy.
[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
What's our presentation about?
Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.
[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!
Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
That's where they remove the uterus.
Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
Everybody loves beets.
...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
I think you���re only a teeny���
Everything's a joke.
Before taxes.
Word.
No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
Oh god.
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
Yup?
Are you laughing at me?
OK, our prices have never been lower.
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?
Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
Mm-hmm. Good safe?
has brought...
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
Okay.
Not by a long shot!
Anything else you need to talk about?
[to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums]
[exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive.
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They���re not for me. They���re for my cousin Mose. He���s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
There���s plenty. Don���t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Okay, this isn���t working for me, ���cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
How as being a minority affected you?
You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]
You are clean. Okay��� One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
[laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!
[box falls over] Oh.
Right, standard.
Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
[incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.
I'm not cr-- uhh!
You made a big mistake. Huge!
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
[applause] Yes! Thank you!
It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
What is the matter with... me?
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
Jan's here.
Doesn't matter.  I'll escort you!
I'm serious. What did you do to it?
Pleasure.
No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
[alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake.
It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM!  Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM! [pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.
Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
It happens occasionally.
Okay, how's that?
All right. Sounds good.
There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
I know. You���re gonna be okay, Monkey.
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
Hey!
Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
OK. [looks at watch and leaves]
Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
Thank you.
-Cornell Application Department,
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
Not doing that.
Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing ��� bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You���re gonna love ���em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world���s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
Thank you. I mean, I���ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh���
[runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.
[scoffs]
Okay.
Can I be team captain?
That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
I���m trying, but what you���re asking is--
Just ugly enough to have deniability.
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
Queen bee.
It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
[laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes!
[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Wow.
I didn't order anything.
Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
You haven't buried her yet?
Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
To do something about-
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
Oscar is out sick.
Michael is your superior.
KGB.
Ok, I'll punch you.
For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no��� Freak, I need a favor.
Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
I asked you a question.
I know.
No I don't.
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
May I please speak to your boss?
No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
Excuse me, Goldschlager, extra flakes.
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
I can���t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
Okay.
I don���t like him either. ��And yet I really like him.
...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
[to troy] Do you have powers?
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
It's called a costume.
Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
Idiot!
Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.
The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? [Pretends to be on phone] ���Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.��� It's that easy.
Come on pretty boy.
Oh, man, never thought I���d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
Mega-Desk.
Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]
You are the master.
No.
I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
I can make him talk, Michael.
You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
That's it.
Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I���m gonna like it.
I have absolutely no idea.
Got 'em. Go!
[whispering] But what if i'm hungry?
There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
She���s got a ton of great qualities. She���s young, she���s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we���re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn���t technically incest.
To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
[Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile���nod. Smile and nod.
If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
It���s 15 feet down, it���s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it���s like your catching a medicine���
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
DRAW SOME BLOOD!
Yeah.
That's impossible.
Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could���ve met in the lobby. It���s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
That's not how it works.
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Absolutely, I do. [giggles]
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
Ha! I don't get it.
Go ahead. Don't lie.
But then no one can see us.
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
You speak English?
[straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.
Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
What do you think?
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
Jim, move!
...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Or real bombs.
So tape it down.
Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
Jim!
Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes.  Also.
Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
[phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he���s free anytime. Not a problem.
But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.
[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
Try again��� Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one��� is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
Copy. Thank you.
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
Can I get you a tankard of mead?
It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
[wraps tape around Stanley���s body]
You are?
What?
Rule three: Don't fall in love.
Okay. Let's go. Step up.
Jim, what do you say?
Peepa, how is she?
Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
[on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.
Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not?
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]
I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
Okay, now here���s the plan. I���m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear]
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
Yours doesn't.
Go. Get the door.
Oh... no... really?
Please.
Can I do some of the talking?
What?
[on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I...
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
That's a ridiculous question.
Hey, he can handle it.
Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
I do!  I want some man meat!
Give me the phone.
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
Yes.
Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
I will. I will. You need to calm down.
What?
How could it be more clear?
���Sedes introiti.��� Seat of entrance.
Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
[on the phone] Oh my God!
Shut up.
Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
Yes. Of course.
Yeah.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Yeah.
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
one noise complaint, several speeding tickets.
Have you seen it?
It was my pants.
[smirking] Oh, yeah.
My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
Come on, break this up.
Alright.
Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
This is not a test! Move to the exits!
Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
[eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?
You remember my cousin Mose.
-But we'll be together then-'
Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don���t know where I���d put you.
You and me, Michael. Yes!
Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He���s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I���ve got big expectations, Mose-wise.
How long has he been in the bathroom?
What makes you think you���d be an effective paper salesman?
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
What about Shoe La La?
[eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela's candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm.
You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go!
China is on the move?
Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
Hey, how's it going, man?
Maybe you do. Hi. I���m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It���s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.
The planet Caprica.
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]
We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!
Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis]   You want half a sandwich?
Normal. Ugly.
Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
No, Michael!
And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
[continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
What? Why would you say that���
You failed?
Thank you.
Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I���m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there���s a mini-reunion. A kind of a ���where are they now��� panel at a local theatre. It���ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven���t seen Kevin since we let him go.
Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Hello.
No, but that's sometimes part of it.
Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan���s costume and check out his notes.
Surprise! [laughs]  Everybody!
Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]
Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
That���s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don���t vibrate at all.
Guten tag, Herr Michael.
Sly dog.
I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
Okay��� Seven, one, one, nine���
The new IT guy. Nick.
And then I inserted my penis-
I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.
Yeah, we���ll see about that.
No, that was my Sensei.
[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
Cri-Man-Squa?
Oh, man!
Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?
That snake!
OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
Oh my God, we have to be there.
Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
No, but we should discuss that another time.
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
OK, what am I thinking right now?
How dare you?
Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.
Let's get back to work.
Are you calling me an idiot?
What?
It's close.
Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
Cut.
Oh, I doubt you���ll make it. Very few do who���ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you���ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before.
No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Stop ordering me around, Jim!
Give me the dice!
I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]
Very funny, Michael!
Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
I knew it. Is it waterproof?
There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
Who are you calling?
[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.
Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]
I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
No, no, no.
Tent, rainfly, gorp...
Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]
[singing]  ... Marilyn Monroe!
Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
Michael, it's time.
No way.
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
Well, the alert was already set to ���Red��� because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ���Double Red���?
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
Yes. Yes.
Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I���ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
Oh yeah?
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
That is a demerit.
Surveillance, gaming- and business.
It's okay, I smell.
Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
I know. I could just bang you right now.
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.
You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
Are you near sighted or far sighted?
There you go.
It means ���excellent���. And we have begun.
Yeah, yeah!
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
Yeah...
Yeah!
[talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.
Who is this?
Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
You can't tantalize me.
Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
I'm not familiar with that expression,
Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
I can't let you in, Michael.
Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.
You most certainly did not.
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
Michael would never let me...
Opus dei.
Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
[shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]
[scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
Let's go!
When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
...is really tight.
[long pause] Crentist.
Yes! Andy, get out here.
It will just take a second.
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
I don't need a key.
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.
Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]
Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join]
[on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that's my name.  See you soon.
How many in your party?
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
Really?
My cervix is ripening.
Lock your door!
I'm all better.
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Tell me where it hurts.
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
Yeah....baby.
I���m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where���s Stanley?
You're supposed to be a cat?
Don't make me do this the hard way.
I was right.
I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.
There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
No.
I'm breathing heavily.
And I was thinking it���s only fair that you help make this decision since they���ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
That is so great about the bonus!
Jim! Open the door!
[grunting, shouting]
Leave, get outta here.
Damn straight.
Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk]
So wait a minute, there's no drugs?
Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
Hey.  No movement.
So who will be your new Number Three?
Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
Male, age 37...
Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?
I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.
I got it.
Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]
Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.
I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
Huh?
No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don���t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So��� have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let���s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So���yes. I���d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
It's true. We all walk alone.
[Dwight come into office unshaven]  What?
What did I say!?
I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.'
Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
I'm about to buy this building, you know.
Oh... Narcolepsy.
Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
[plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]
Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
What did you just call him?
Really?
[thinks] Interview.
Hmm.
Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
[cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?
He's gonna love it!
Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?
None of your business. I'm writing something.
Two at a time!
Damn it.
Huh. Do you like candy?
Let me out or you're fired.
[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
I found it under the seat.
No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
Excellent.
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?
Admit that there is a chance.
Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]
What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
Absolutely I would not.
God, you're such a spy.
So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
Come and get it!
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.
How many fingers am I holding up?
I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure.
Feast on this, Lewis.
Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the?
You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.
C���mon.
Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Yeah. I can barely...
Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he���s slouching. Okay, can you���sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Yeah, you know me.
Can I talk to you about something?
Yeah, and we���re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
That is so cool.
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
There's no gum. There never was any gum.
Oh my God.
I found twins.
This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
And I turned it down.
[boastfully] Yes.
My headphones are broken.
There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.
I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
Do it.  Promote me.  Tri-managers.
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
That is all. Have a good morning.
I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
Silence?
No, Michael.
I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
Accountability booster.
Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
Yes!
What?
How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
Big smiles folks! There they are.
That's what she said.
Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
Yeah, right. I���m afraid that ship has sailed.
They fall under the category of airplanes.
What's this? What is this?
I...
I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
Yeah, maybe I���ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it���s the most pleasant I���ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
Yes?
Yeah Jim.
Yes, I do.
Walkie-talkies.
[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!
You have never been cooler.
What did you do to it?
[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Damn it!
If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
No, absolutely not.
What?
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]
You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
Why him?
Same thing.
OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
Ready?
Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate!
Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
Lunch.
Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I���ll do mine���.. walnuts?
Does Michael talk about
What's your pin number?
Oh, don���t lie. I���m trying to save those precious knees you���re always bragging about. ��Now, let���s get out of here. He could be right behind us.
Okay---
Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It���s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
...for people's behavior.
[over phone] Who is that monkey?
You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
[grunts] Okay, we���re good. We���re good. Let���s go. Push!
I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
You're leaving?
Not coming, have plans.
I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
[clapping] Best Dundies ever.
I'm coming Michael!
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
Like the spirit of Christmas!
I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
That's just a verb.
What's the plan?
And you'll compare the times?
Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound.
Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor���s had stolen from him?
My hip bone!
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
You���re being disrespectful!
Why?
You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
Before I go, may I?
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ���please kitty, may I have some more?��� You can���t make this stuff up!
Check it out.
Oh, you're kidding me!
Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
Yes ma'am.
Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?
Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...
Wh--
Michael, it's Phyllis.
[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!
None of your business.
Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
David, is that you?
So what kind of commissions you get up there?
Thank you.
Birthday hug!
[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh���should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
Good morning temp.
And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
[Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying.  When my workers-gather-
[coolly] Seems like you already know where.
Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
Ok, ok.
[sighs] Please? Please?
One word.
Waste of a good hatchet.
Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
Aggggh, that stings!
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]
Oh, please.
Wait, sales���what sales meeting?
They really do that.
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
You dressed exactly like the servants.
[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
Come on.
Michael.
What kind of mortgage did you get?
OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
It's in Maryland.
Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
Yes. I am.
...confess to health care fraud.
It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]
If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
Fine.  Good.
What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face]
It's about adapting to the circumstances.
And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Yes I did.
Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
So sexy it becomes hostile.
What?
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!
Gahh!
No.
You really want Packer as your boss?
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can���t believe you came.
Why just Michael?
Standing.
No, pictures are too interpretive.
Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
Sniffling how?
Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
You haven���t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let���s go over membership. I���m going to need the first month���s and the last month���s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month���
Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
[yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Shut up.
Could be a bat weevil��� Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
Hey guys.
Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
Of course you are.
Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
[whispers] Yeah.
Oh, man. White people, right?
In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
I don't believe you. Continue.
Jim.
It would be better if you were unconscious.
$100 a day, plus expenses.
No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
I don't think she'd be missed.
Assistant Sensei.
Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
Yeah.
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
No thank you.
No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.
Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
Where?
Dwight Schrute.
Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
I deserve this. You know I do!
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he���s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.
No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
Don't leave us!
Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?
[on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?!
Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn���t seem so macho now, does it? It���s a jump rope!
Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.
No, you stop.
Do you want to do this right or not?
My title has 'Manager' in it.
Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
You know what? You���re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you���re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]
Well, it should be.
Good. Real good.
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
Don't do it, Michael.
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
Hey. Hey. Jerry.
What? Something happened?
I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
I'd think about it.
It's fine. What?
I love you!
That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
Gotcha! Yeah! Let���s see ya get out of this web, huh?
Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there���s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
What is the antidote?
Uh huh.
I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.
Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
Do you have the Sharpie?!
Who was the second man on the moon?
There you go!
Okay, really?
Oh, good, and you resent this because...
Oh, that's perfect!
Cocks in the henhouse.
Right here.
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
[laughs] I think you know.
[golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat]
Yep.
Hello.
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
Kevin, not now.
[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.
Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That���s right. You���re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
She had a hysterectomy.
Yes.
[clears throat]
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
Please take an agenda item.
I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
Fine!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
Who's the father?
Right over by that fence.
We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]
Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
They should not be in that room.
Oh, God.
All their top clients I can't believe it.
I am ready for my performance review.
Ahh!
Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.'
Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the 'trappings' of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
Tonight.
[singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.
I gave her a higher clearance than you.
Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
Ask him about the party.
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
Go, get up there right now.
Hey stranger.
You're gonna need to be more specific.
That's impossible.
You read my mind.
I want Michael to take me...
[laughing together] Yeah!
I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]
That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
What's the square footage?
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
[singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
My eyes!
I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
They match the carpet
That never happened. He���s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ���saving treats��� from the kitty litter box.
Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
What is the capital of Maine?
If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]
The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter]
Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
Do you accept?
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
Michael.
Been there, done that.
Ingredients.
No. We can���t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
Paranoid? I���m not familiar with the word. And I really don���t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
So what do you want?
I had fish yesterday.
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
Pam.
You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
Mm-hmm.
Has Michael checked in?
Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]
Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
Okay. [looks ashamed]
Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
Chicken fight!
Coopers has calamari.
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
You can't just move out.
[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please.
Including prep time?
Where we going?
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
So don't.
This ought to be good.
Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
And wake up in the future.
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
And your affiliation with Cornell -
Yes!
You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
I do.
I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
Eughh. [looks disgusted]
No! [lunges for a large wooden spool]
I've got a treat for you!
Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
Where are all the animals?
[spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah!
Good night.
Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
If you say screw you one more time...
Do you know how to use it?
[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
Sure
I'm gonna take you home Michael.
Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
Thanks for meeting me.
Hello, Dwight Schrute?
No. Why not do it now?
Wait, I see you every day. Can I say 'Good month?'
Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
[sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...
No the other thing.
Anything else would be inconsistent.
Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They���re a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We���d go in pretending to be family ��� brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store.  Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
Your concern is noted.
[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.
I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
Let me see your ID.
You snubbed her.
Jim.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
You seem suprised.
You believe a computer can beat me?
By any means necessary?
I have a smudge on my forehead?
Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
[trumpet sounds]
Then I refuse.
Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]
I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
I'm great. How are you?
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
Why don't you just buy the whole song?
[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.
Where are they?
Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
Yes you did.
Copy.
Good morning Michael.
[confused] No.
Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
Uh, 24. 37.
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
Hey.
No, there's no blood.
Are you kidding me?
Excuse me sir.
What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous.
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
Really?
[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
Oh, I bet you think it���s all about core, huh?
I want to be here when you fire her ass.
You had to, what other choice did you have?
No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]
Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
[in disgust] Oh...
[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
Okay, listen. I���m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I���ve never actually done this before.
Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
--to use sudden violence.
Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
[grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
Uhh.
Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
[On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
Ok, good
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning 'Love,' and adelph, meaning 'Adolf.' 'the city that loves Adolf.' Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
MR. RYAN HOWARD!
Take a good look at this boy...
Wait, so you���re the boss?
You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
NO!
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Please, I'll make you proud.
[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!
Cause I could look it up real easily.
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
Misdemeanor?
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
No! No, no! [groans]
Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we���ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War���
Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
[show her the wound] Oh God.
[while everyone is gathered playing and singing ���Sons & Daughters���] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
It's going to be ok.
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
Very funny Jim.
I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
Jim���wha��� Come on! What���what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
[holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
Yep.
[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
I'm gonna set your face on fire.
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
So you���ll do it?
I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
Go back to the monkey!
No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead.
Oh, you wish.  Hellboy's a hero.
[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
I'm gonna answer Charles first.
Will never be her name.
Pam?
So, you--
De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]
[imitating '80s rock]
Right.
Cradle my head!
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
Sex.
I'll have to talk to the manager.
Game on!
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
... is there any news on the leads?
Come on in, the water���s fine.
Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
And for���oh, whoopsie daisy. [chuckles]
That is not true.
Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]
It smells like chicken soup.
Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?
Come on old lady. Let's go.
This is Dunder Mifflin...
Well, well, well, it���s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
[slams cell phone on desk] Argh! Ahh!!
I don't think so.
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
I throat-rip.
Hmm?
[looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one.
What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.
Hello.
No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
Hmm. It wasn't here before.
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
Yes, sir.
Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
Yes.
Cute kids, thanks for coming.
Come on.
I want an answer by tomorrow.
Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
Oscar...
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...
I will stay here and run things on this end.
I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.
Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
Say it. Do it. Now.
No.  I think you should date Kelly.
All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
So we know which truck to van...
I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'
Great.
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
Who is the king of England?
Oh.
[terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
Argggg!
What?
It's not rabid.
Meat grinder.
I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.
Why would I put a banana in my holster?
[whispering] You okay?
Pfft, ���Athlead���? Please. They���re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ���Stumpany,��� for ���Stupid Company.���
Roll in the hay, five dollars.
The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
I was -- I was right.
When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
Ah damn pop-ups.
Fine. Get outta here.
I have been my whole life.
[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]
Still.
Let's do it!
No, everything's fine.
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?
Mm, good stuff.
Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]
It doesn't make any sense.
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
What?
Just now.
[sighs] Now, how can I help you?
I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.
Oh, huggy hugs.
So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
Thank you.
Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]
Very funny, Jim.
That's our theme.
Sheriff Pierce? I'm turning in my badge.
What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
[enters main office, group claps] Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
What?
I'm peeing in this empty can.
Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
Well, saddles��� [clicks tongue, whinnies] ��� sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Okay, that is
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
Really.
Yeah!
I know. Evel Knievel.
Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I'm really sorry... about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
Damnit! Damnit Jim!
There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
Just hush.
I have no way of knowing if that's true.
[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.
[taps Jim's hand with his foot]
Are you really not going to punch him?
But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
I don't want to do this.
...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.
Hello.
[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.
No. Angela! What are you saying?
I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
Diversifying. Smart.
All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
Our theme, if you will.
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
Please tell me. I've been so good...
Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!
[sighs] It's firm.
And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
Six percent, I know my worth.
The truth.
Let's go.
You don���t need to repeat right now, when I���m saying it.
Mm hm.
No. And the sheets are made of fire.
[Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.
