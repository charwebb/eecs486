Andy.
Uh-huh.
Don't do it [lobs something at Michael]
Excuse me?
You can���t have someone murdered.
You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ���ahhmmm��� excuse me��� What?! Not now, I'm busy.
That's not how it works.
[thinks] Interview.
You know what you need? Closure.
Wait, it���s not D.M Utica, is it?
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
Knight Rider.
[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...
Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.
What are some of your small business ideas?
This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end.
And you are���
[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Ah-luh-luh, a little comment.  Muh.
[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
They could do better.
[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]
So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]
It's not rabid.
First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
Seedless?
Was she talkin' back?
Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
Are you going?
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
Thank you Sandra!
OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
[throws hard, Jim doesn���t catch] Nice catch.
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
Are you saying you invented paper?
A knife.
[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
Yeah.
I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.  [bites into the sandwich half, chews]  Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat.
We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
Final touch-ups.
That is all. Have a good morning.
It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
Really?
Push!
Now, listen,...
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
She's only a cat.
Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]
You can't do that.
Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!
[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
Oh my God, we have to be there.
You can't just move out.
Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves]
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]
I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.
It's not really 1992 anymore.
No, I didn't.
There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but���
You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
Uh, 24. 37.
Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
Alright. [leads Michael away]
No.
You have never been cooler.
Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
Yes!
But don't forget you owe me $10.
Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
It's gorgeous.  Let's go!
Alright! Uh! [Spanks himself]
Do you mind? The men are talking.
Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
You'll fall in love with her.
[coughs]
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!
Yeah, yeah!
Yes.
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
Yes!
I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
And, well, I don't see my co-workers--
Pam, are you all right?
An ���X.���
Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
Michael! My water's breaking!
Jonas.
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
Why is she marrying Andy?
Just trying to be helpful.
Right?
Did I tell you about her teeth?
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Are you calling me an idiot?
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
Possibly.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?
You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
No! No!
Yeah!
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Can I be team captain?
Here, here��� Just���
Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.
Come on. Come on.
It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?
Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That���s it? Oh, that���s great. That���s like a five second delay.
Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers]
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They���re a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We���d go in pretending to be family ��� brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store.  Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
This isn���t gonna work out.
Aah!
Thanks for inviting me along.
Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
Thank you.
one noise complaint, several speeding tickets.
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
Could be.
Talk to you later, Jan.
Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
[walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim's pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim's voice] 'We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our...' [pauses recording] I've got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  I'm not insane. [starts the recording again] '...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.'
I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
Yaoo yay! [claps]
No women or children, unless provoked.
Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
[takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!
Come on, let���s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
No.
Yeah Jim.
Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part]
[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh���should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
There were. A lot of them.
Oh, you get kicked.
Yes.
[hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the?
Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
In. I'm hungry.
It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
Hiii! [kicks Michael]
It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they���re out of the house.
[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
No you're not.
Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
This is so awesome.
Copy. Thank you.
That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
Really.
She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Kevin Costner.
You could ask for an extension.
Great, right up there.
Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
I will tell on you.
[on phone with Jim] I hope you���ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it���s time for another episode of ���Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire���.
Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
Battlestar Galactica isn't a documentary exactly.
This expresses how loudly I love you.
This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
What do you say?
Is somebody after you?
Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
You throat-rip.
Tonight.
I'll glance at it.
Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
Washington Monument.
Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
Not by a long shot!
[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
Sometimes it hurts Michael.
Same old.
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
Mmm-hmm.
You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
Bull... [bleep] [clears throat] Sorry.
You did.
That is my idea.
Thanks.
They are unrelated.
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
[surprising Kelly] Aha!
[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!
Yes.
Ah! Not so fast.
It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-
Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
Wha...
What does it say?
Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
Hey!
Will end completely!
Mm-hmm.
Bye Pam.
It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
I'll call you back.
No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
Come on in, the water���s fine.
No.
That's a common swindlers trick.
There is no way that hurt.
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis]   You want half a sandwich?
Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
I bet she had hairy armpits.
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
You have to interview me...
This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it's handle] You sell a lot of these?
What?
I can... Yes, sensei.
[talking over Michael] God, what a steal.
Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
That is a damnable lie. I love women.
...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
You choose!
I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
No, [mumbling] I don't know.
Which one's yours?
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
Don't be an idiot.' Changed my life.
Huh? You like that?
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
We have more houses to visit.
Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...
Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.
All Right
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
OK.
Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
Uh. [eats antacids]
Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn���t on the itinerary.
You haven���t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let���s go over membership. I���m going to need the first month���s and the last month���s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month���
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news���thing.
Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
Really, that's your real name?
Where did you get those?
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
I'm just...
While you were gone...
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
[while everyone is gathered playing and singing ���Sons & Daughters���] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
Michael.
Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
Of course there���s a costume! [laughs] ��Oh, this is gonna be great. There���s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?
[walks in dressed as Jim] Pam.
Oh, that's my last one.
I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]
Cell phone?  Charger?
I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.
Oscar is out sick.
Wake up! [Cathy screams]
Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
God!
Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.
Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.
Need any help?
It's going to be ok.
What?
[scoffs] The boss isn't funny.
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
Yeah.
That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.
[as elevator door closes] Hold it!
It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.
You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls.  We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
(smirking) Exactly.
Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]
That���s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!
No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
Okay.
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
Women look like white slaves.
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
That's just absurd.
[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Oh, you wish.  Hellboy's a hero.
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
Good.
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
[impatient sigh]
[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
What is the capital of Maine?
What?
Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
Jim --
I see dead people.
Impossible, I love the law.
Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate!
I am not bluffing!
Yeah, get them, Creed!
Thanks old man.
Thank you.
Good morning temp.
Consider it?
I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
[interrupting] ��� lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
Yeah!
Queen's higher.
Go ahead and just read the frosting.
Wow--
And Dwight.
This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.
Motel 6? Best Western?
Idiot.
You did this for me? [camera pans to 'Welcome Back Oscar' sign]
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he���s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!
[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.
Wow!
Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]
Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]
I don't even know what to say.
That���s a bit extreme.
Bring it.
Okay.
Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?
[on the phone] Oh my God!
Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he���s slouching. Okay, can you���sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
Mmm-hmm.
Waste of time.
I do not!  I do not say 'Hi' Pam!
Toby.
Oh.
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
Oh, it's so wet.
Did you even read the memo?
Good. They good?
Rebel Yell, Billy Idol
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
[sighs and picks up Michael's empty suitcases]
Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Ready? What do you think?
Done.
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.
Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
[entering office] What's going on?
Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
Rule two: we stop at nothing.
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
Ohhhhhh!
My title has 'Manager' in it.
Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
What's your pin number?
My pants fell down! I don���t have a belt!
Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It���s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!
If I guess, will you tell me?
I can save the branch.
What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
Calm, please
I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
Jim, what do you say?
Hold your breath.
Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.
No kidding.
Just, write it down, please.
Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
What's a dis... what's that?
Yup?
Yep.
Well, you have...
OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
Fail!
Come on, folks!
I thought you guys couldn���t come.
Yeah!
Uh, if they don't bobble, what's the point?
Ding dong.
C���mon, c���mon.
[fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they���re not even good. Really, they���re bad. Like you and your son.
I got it. I got it.
And one girl push-up.
No, that is huge.
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
[eating banana] Mm, less than three.
I take full responsibility.
That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
[walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry.
Everybody!
I don't think so, no.
And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
Do you know where we are, temp?
Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
Mm.
When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
[scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
No.  I think you should date Kelly.
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
[coolly] Seems like you already know where.
[whispers] Yeah.
Just lice Pam?
[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
What do you think?  You've got an hour.
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
Look at that one.
So, you ever been convicted of a felony?
The city of Atlanta.
Well���no, no���n���
Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
Yeah.
Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
Well I will prove you wrong.
Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
I���ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I���m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Go. Get the door.
No, please don't do this, monkey.
Aaaaaaaa!
I found twins.
I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
You���re the Quizno���s. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn���t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
Silver medal.
There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
For what purpose?
Mm hm.
But I don't have any...
You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
Please take an agenda item.
Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
Wait, what?  You can't take what?
[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
Walk out of the house...
Michael.
Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
You want rabies? Be my guest.
And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
Yes.
Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
Michael, I...
You're lying.
Shove it through! Break it!
Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling]  Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
I'm the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!
Can I get you a tankard of mead?
No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
That means ye, Plop!
[heated discussion in the 'Dwight Schrute Workspace', door opens] I did not dismiss you.
Yeah.
[talking over Michael] Yes.
Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?
Message in a Bottle, The Postman...
Everybody! Hang on! [Dwight pulls out quickly]
And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling]
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
... is there any news on the leads?
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
[to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums]
Hey shut up.  You're dead.
Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other���s minds. You���re trying to give your wife this job.
Let me out or you're fired.
You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
I will know.
Yeah.
[confused] No.
None of your business.
Mm-hm.
Hey, what was she like?
It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]
Pam was supposed to get 'em.
Get your clouds right.
That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
Yeah, but no nipples.
What you doing?
In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
That's good enough for me. [exhales again]
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.
Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.
Recyclops will have his revenge.
American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
No way. What if I meet someone?
Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
Eighty thousand dollars a year.
I have absolutely no idea.
[stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.
I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file]  'Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.' Juvie. 'According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor...'  Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]
What is a scented candle?
There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
Right?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
You did?
Yum.
Yeah.
I can tell. I won't let you down.
The bride and groom? What are their names?
Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
[rolls eyes] Jim, come on.
Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot.
And your affiliation with Cornell -
The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.
Yeah.
Come on!!
Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
You are out of order.
Michael, nice tie or something.
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
It's about this very announcement you just made.
You know there's a ghost in this office
Hungry?
Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
Yeah, trust me.
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
Ah, I'm not interested.
Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]
WE ARE WARRIORS!
I do, I have to go.
Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
[continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Daraas!
You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
What is this?
How's it hanging?
Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound.
This. Ends. Now.
So wait a minute, there's no drugs?
Yes!
Describe it.
I do!
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!
You know what this is?
I had a tickle in my throat.
Salad.
I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door]
OK, where does it hurt?
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...
A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
Great. Get the plate number.
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Oh, Esther.
Who is the king of Prussia?
Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
I'm Jigsaw, idiot.
Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
Remember what we had Larry?
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
[quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
Yeah?
Damn it.
[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
Okay.
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
Give it a whirl.
Let's go check out the master bedroom.
...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
Oh my god.
No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
[taps Jim's hand with his foot]
Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
You didn't have to.
[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
Yeah!
Yes!
It's about adapting to the circumstances.
She had a hysterectomy.
Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief]
No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.
We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Yes.
Pam?
[laughs] Nice.
Yes.
Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]
Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
Watching?
[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
On one condition. You...
Michael, I don't know...
I can���t get it out. Try again!
We did it!
Just ugly enough to have deniability.
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ��� how do I put this ��� steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
I knew it. Is it waterproof?
Thank you, Jim.
OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.
Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I���ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I���ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I���m doin��� great.
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
[singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
I'm on it.
[on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that's my name.  See you soon.
Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
My headphones are broken.
Try 'Big Boobs' with a 'Z'.
[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]
I'm peeing in this empty can.
Got it.
I'll stay for ten.
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
But you're the one who picked today.
[jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
Excellent idea, Pam.
Oh, yeah.
...from the 1930's...
You sure?
Make-up sex. Nice!
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
Oh I did. I did.
Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
[grunts in frustration]
No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He���s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He���s my tribe.
Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I���m back.
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
You won���t stop until you���ve poached us all.
[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly]
Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.
What?
There���s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.
[raises hand] Here.
I heard you say ���well��� the first time.
Breathing. Is that you?
I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's...
Wha���Yes. Your attention. Uh because��� No that is all. [walks out]
My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.
Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
Ok
500 and one penny.
Extend the fingers more.
Been there, done that.
Oh god.
She called you D?
No no no, I can't let you do this!
Oh no, no, no.
Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
He'll die.
[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.
They really do that.
You don't know what you need. Just...
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
What?
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
I know how we can learn his tricks.
Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
Mr. Peanut is not classy.
I���ve seen enough.
Really.
Alright.  I'll call you, kid.
Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ���Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.��� [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Shh Shh.
Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the?
I was trying to go-
Get lost.
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
Michael?
You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
I haven't made a decision yet.
I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.'
Oh, no, no. It's on the Miata.
Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check��� on that later today. This is my grandmother���s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother���s buttock bullet ring.
You're thinking of deer penis.
Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office]
Let's do it!
���But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark���s getting out of my car. He���s a good boy, does whatever I say.
Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
There he is.
Fine. Five times. [signs contract]
Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah!
Yeah.
You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
Then I refuse.
I know. I could just bang you right now.
For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
I'm barren, Jim.
Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
Wow. Late every day this week.
Okay.
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
No.
They have some great kitchen ideas.
Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you���re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
Thank you, Sensei.
I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
[to camera] Same thing.
Man, what is taking Toby so long?
You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
Ask him about the party.
Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
I will.
...'cause there's no comeback for that.
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
Shut up.
Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
I was -- I was right.
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
OK. [looks at watch and leaves]
Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Oh, you think they���re my only friends? I���ve got way more friends than that, and they���re all better than the losers who work here.
The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
Guilty!
The new guys called a sales meeting?
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That���s right. You���re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
Do you have your card?
Yes! As your representative?
Thank you. [hangs up phone]
Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
Yes.
Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
[voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
Why not call...
In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
It���s a colloquial way of saying ���you���re fired,��� Kevin, which you are.
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'
No.
We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package]
Wait, I see you every day. Can I say 'Good month?'
We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
Absolutely I would not.
Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
I'm thirsty!
Super 8?
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
How ya feeling, better?
Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
Wh--
Eughh. [looks disgusted]
Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
You heard me!
Gotcha! Why are you late?
Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
Yeah!
[unimpressed] Really?
Standing.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Are you really not going to punch him?
Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Zip your lid!
Ugh.
Yes.
I'm pumped!
It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]
You've already been several times.
I'll take that as a no.
Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
I think I saw it!
Get up off your desks!
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]
Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Look at him. I���ve never seen such a beautiful child.
[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
Yeah. It's practical.
Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
Okay, I'm on it!
Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
Hey, he can handle it.
You know what? I'm a little busy.
Or real bombs.
Hear anything interesting?
You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]
I'm great. How are you?
I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure.
Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.
Retaliation. Tit for tit.
300 and one penny.
Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
[looking pregnant] Hey Michael?
[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.
My wound hasn't healed yet.
Oh.
[yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.
You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
Fresh hot ink.
You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Oh.
Hey, this is none of your business.
It's a common question.
If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.
You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian
Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
They're still good for another week.
Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
OK, our prices have never been lower.
Prestige is ours. Okay, they���re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you���ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ���Infuriating, irresponsible���...
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
I'll have a cup of a coffee.
Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
I'm on official business.
You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.
Why don't you just buy the whole song?
But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
Yeah!
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Spoken like a true root man.
Thanks so much Earl.
Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
People love beets.
Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
Misdemeanor?
I���m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where���s Stanley?
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
Yes!
What were you talking about in there?
You don't know?
Nice, very nice.
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
Then looks like we have a deal��� Son [holds up a suit identical to his]
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
Make a decision.
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
Let's do this thing.
It's by the ream?
This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.
[exclaims] Atherozar!
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
[on the phone] Yes, Howard Gruber, please.
[agreeing] Mm.
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
They are now.
Henrietta.
Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
I apologized for that.
On three. One... two... three.
A hunter.
Saleswoman has a vagina.
Death to Toby!
You are the future!
It could be kind of funny.
But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
Hello.
Okay. [looks ashamed]
All Right!
China is on the move?
Talk me through an appendectomy.
Our theme, if you will.
Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!
Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
Euughh��� Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present��� Hey.
I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Just wait and send it to voicemail.
Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That���s Lloyd.
OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
What?
He's gonna love it!
[on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?
oh���
No thank you.
Well, it doesn't...
I'll do it! I always say, 'You want something done right? Ask Dwight.' Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
Hi Daryl. I���m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
No, try me.
Perfect casting, right?
Okay, and remember-you're not gay.
Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
Does it have a deck?
Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!
I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
And I turned it down.
What did you---
[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
And you want me to come with you.
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim's hand and leaves]
What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
One of the warehouse guys.
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
Uh huh.
He went over your head to go behind your back.
[Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa....
Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
What? You?
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying]
Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.
Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael ...
Jim.
Hit the nos.
OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]
Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
[on telephone] Good. Excellent. Thank you.
No.
Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
No wait, what are you doing?!
Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
Thank you.
I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
Okay.
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
Oh.
Oh.
No. Jim, come on.
Not Dwight.
No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
[joins in] Shrute! Shrute!
--the party planning committee...
You had black hair and then gray hair.
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]
I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
The fire guy! The fire guy!
Yeah.
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]
I work with Michael.
Which is, of course���
N-no there's not.
Okay. [sits]
Sure thing.
Good.
Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.
What do you think?
Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder]
Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
With this move, he can't get you.
I am hardly the problem, Jim.
I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?
What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Yeah.
Gahh!
To intimidate my subordinates.
Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.
What did you do? Huh?
Ok. First impressions?
Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
Nope.
Normal. Ugly.
Any brothers or sisters?
My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
Don't want it.
I think I cut my penis on the lid!
Brought it in here-
One word.
She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
It would be better if you were unconscious.
Yeah.
[wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]
Yes, I was quilled.
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Let's get to it.
There is no shower.
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
Maybe that's how you die.
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
Word.
Where are all the animals?
Take a bowl and pass it down.
In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
The twirl sucks.
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
I see Esther's back in town.
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
[sighs]
What happened?
He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don���t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
No... no. One crisis at a time.
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
Dwike?
You're leaving?
We're gonna bust this guy.
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
Yes.
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]
I know how it happened.
Oh, man. White people, right?
Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
I know. You���re gonna be okay, Monkey.
That's a total waste of your 'M.'
There's a photo...
What lab did these little clones escape from?
Are you serious?
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
No, we haven���t ordered anything. No one���s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
Okay, you can stop.
[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.
Does it specify which windshield?
It's that easy?
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
No.
I'm all better.
This is a bus transfer.
So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
Hey, what are you listening to?
...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]
No, I wanna seduce her.
Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
Okay.
No. Let him get his own. It���s Syracuse money.
I am nigh!
Pushing on.
I think you need to confess...
Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you���re in a suicide cult.
This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
[smirking] Oh, yeah.
That���s great. Let���s do this guys.
How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
Accountability booster.
[in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
I didn't lose my desk.
[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!
No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.'
[hands Erin a basket of beets]
Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.
Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
What's going on?
I will do my voodoo.
Really?
And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
This conversation has two items on the agenda.
Ha ha! Yeah, joke���s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
Same thing.
You did. Several times. Over and over again.
Yes.
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don't hang up.
Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
[playing volleyball] Hit it Andy!
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
I have.
[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
Aha! A lightbulb.
Shunning resumed.
[with a small fist pump] Yes!
[Mose drops cage and runs] Mose!
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
Okay, I can do that.
Shampoo.
That's unacceptable.
Shh.
[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?
No.
No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
Merry Christmas.
Your fictitious name?
If you let me run it.
You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
I think you���re only a teeny���
Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'
Not true. And if they did, they couldn't because I'm password protected.
What?
Let's see yours.
Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!'
You mean, like a ham?
In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
[out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
It is time to unveil the tree.
I was wondering-
Yeah.
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
With today���s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it���s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']
We gotta see what he's got.
[Shakes head]
Jim. Definitely.
Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
[laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
The pressure!  The pressure!
[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]
Oh man,
[in bullhorn] Pull over!
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
It's my car now.
I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear]
Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]
Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
Tootenbacher.
One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
Good luck to you. [disconnects call]
If you say screw you one more time...
I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
No way, it's the KGB.
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
Hey monkey, what's up?
It is not a B and B.
Thank you.
Pam.
Please, I can double your pace.
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
Not so fast.
[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
[straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.
Wash your hands, Kevin.
It's about Michael.
[in Jim's office]  Sign this.
Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
He doesn't even want to go.
Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
No!
Good Morning!
You seem a little nervous. You shouldn't be.
All right then. Someone propose a plan.
Hey Pam.
[clapping] Best Dundies ever.
Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
Anyone else?
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He���s gonna be moving slowly. It���s only���
What will you do?
Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
No, I insist.
Jim won't sign my expense report.
Jim! Open the door!
[enters main office, group claps] Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
Should I clean out my desk?
I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
[singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]
Would that make you happy?
Ah!
I know you did.
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
Roll in the hay, five dollars.
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.
Here���s how I���m going to help out from now on. I���m going to not care, and I���m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy���s inevitable demise.
Obviously. I knew it.
[answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
You wanted to see me?
Yup.
How?
Door. Chair. It���s about Phillip.
[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
You're welcome.
Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
Parka...
I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
You know what?
Hey.  No movement.
Do you live in a regular sized house?
So, all the numbers adding up?
I need to go over some details with you.
How do you know it's going to be a boy?
No, you don't.
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
That's really fattening.
No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
What were you doing in there?
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial.
Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
[mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.
Hello, you're back.
So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
I am so sorry.  I'm so sorry, sir.
Of course I saw it.
Ahh! OK!
Michael, can you explain?
That would have been really embarrassing.
I thought it went great.
Well, it should be.
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
I just might be his father.
Good.
[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]
Please? Please, Pam?
Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
That was... unauthorized.
Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.
Argh!
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
Welcome to our land.
Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
Dwight Schrute.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.
So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
Absolutely... not.
Hey, IT guy.
I have something to do.
Okay!
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
No communication with the outside world Jim.
Have a seat.
Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
Men find me desirable.
There's a hose out back.
Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
Nnnnn, that's not... okay.
Aaah!
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
I have been my whole life.
I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]
Jim, put those away.
What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!
Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
That's what she said.
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
Please?
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
Of course.
Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute'
Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.
Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
What?
Like baboons or elephants.
Cool, let's start with the banisters.
[to group] OK, let���s look at some ties.
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.
That is true.
I deserve this. You know I do!
I'm cashing in the favor.  Fire him.
Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
I could never do that!
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
No way.
Where's your tie?
Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.
That doesn���t sound crazy, Jim. That���s the sanest thing I���ve ever heard.
[golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat]
If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
Very close.
[kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
Rule three: Don't fall in love.
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
And how big do you want this robot?
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
Some of these kernels have crowned.
Yes.
He totally misses,
Great.
Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter]
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
Hello, spoiled little baby, [to a watermelon] in your fancy brand name stroller.  Mmm, I wonder if it's as safe as they say it is.  Oh, look, a curb.  Uh oh, let's see what happens... [lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.  My parents left me beside the road.  I crawled home.
It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
Yeah....baby.
[smiling] No thank you.
Robert.
No need to thank me.
Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
Fine.
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!
Obesity-caused illnesses.
Accepted.
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
Good. Real good.
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
No.
[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here���s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]
Idiot!
And then if I want...
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
Inventor of the cotton gin.
Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
From Jim.
[applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
I���ll stall him. Go!
Just the one window?
We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.
Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.
I could, but I just don���t feel like it loser.
There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
Why would I put a banana in my holster?
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
For five years I���ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it���s time for me to just let that thought go. It���s kind of painful, but it���s also freeing in a way. Now it���s all about my instincts.
What?
I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
It���s all right. Andy approved it.
[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
He went to Gabe behind your back.
No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Oh. Of course.
Ah! [throws punch] That���s how it���s done.
Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join]
What look?
I put everything back in the vending machine.
We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
I'd think about it.
Lake Erie.
I know. Evel Knievel.
Yes.
Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
Give me the dice!
You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
Stupid!
But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!
Can I be team manager?
[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
What?
Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.
It's Christmas Toby.
People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.
He's searching out younger gays.
Who's the father?
You know it.
Michael?
I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.
Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
You were on a boat.
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.
You can't.
No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
[winks] I'm on it. [leaves room]
Out of loyalty to this company...
[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
In your office? [in Michael's office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
Yeah, do tell.
The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
No, that was my Sensei.
I broke it.
Where are we going?
You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
[off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?
Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.
Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
Believe it.
It was my pants.
Question.
I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
What is going on?
Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.
You wanted to see me?
Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
It's only Meredith.
All right!
Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]
Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]
Stop it.
Good. How are you doing?
Come on, let's go. Take a seat.
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
What? No way!
Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
On an innocent baby.
Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
And I have to say your leadership...
Well...
You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
Thank you.
Two at a time!
What? Idiot.
Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not?
Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]
Let's go!
Okay.
Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that���s great.
Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
Thank you.
I could've gotten that, idiot!
I got it.
Oh, my God.
Bildenkinder.
Everybody!
What? What's so wierd?
Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He���s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I���m hesitant. Why can���t I pull the trigger on any of them?
No, absolutely not.
Thirty-two meatballs.
Look.  She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She's a bumpkin.  Pass.
Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
Jim. I���m not kidding. I need you.
Point it towards the store, idiot!
Yeah, right. I���m afraid that ship has sailed.
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
It's just for family.
I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now.  She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
No. We can���t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
[hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him]
Don't tell Michael...
No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
So what I���m hearing you say is, ���Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible���?
No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
Five percent. No less.
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.
We have... a bat... in the office.
Your foot?
Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.
Single... OK.
Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
That's true.
My calls?
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We���re running late. Let���s get him inside.
I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
Open the gates! There���s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There���s plenty for everyone!
Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
Anything else you need to talk about?
[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!
...and then we compare notes.
No, my groin...
I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
Don���t worry, it���s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It���s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face]
No, Michael.
I have a girlfriend...
Get in the van.
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
I'm not a barbarian.
I���ll get my apprehension kit.
Okay.
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
No.
I love that show.
I figured it would save time.
No. [holds Sheriff's Department mug protectively]
Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?
What were your favorite moments?
YEAH!
[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
Just doing my job.
Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back.
Very funny Jim.
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]
I'm coming Michael!
Having trouble finding a vein?
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
[on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?!
I'm sorry.
Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.
That's fine.
Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
That���s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don���t vibrate at all.
[standing up] Get out.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
What?
[singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
Gah!
Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
Come and get it!
None taken. What do you got?
Thank you, Angela.
Go ahead.
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
Birthday hug!
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
Hey, temp.
From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
It doesn't make any sense.
Hey. Enjoy your new clump.
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
Angela, you're up.
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
My cervix is ripening.
No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
Two more.
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
All right, let's do this.
Well, it���s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
Shut up. That's impossible.
I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
Wait, what girlfriend?
[applause] Oh yes! Yeah!
If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.
Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
Really?
[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
I'm ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
NO!
Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
No.
What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
Yep.
Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
Why are you looking at my forehead?
... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
Oh! [collapses]
Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!
No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
I, Jim Halpert...
You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
What kind of filing?
Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.
Stop giggling.
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
What?
[talking over Jim] Okay.
[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
You'll be fine over there.
Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
You said you didn't know how to say it.
You���re working for ���Stumpany��� too?
Cute kids, thanks for coming.
[whispering] What do you need from me?
[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
Yup.
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
Where did you read that?
Oh, just...
I'm thirsty.
All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring.
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
I'm breathing heavily.
Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?
Are you sure that's going to work?
Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
What did they do to you, Angela?
If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]
[looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
Maybe you should.  Whatever.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Taste good too.
Alright, move it.
Yes.
What? This is such bullcrap!
Okay.
Pam, would you care for a bagel?
Angela, not here!
No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
Exactly.
What?  No, this is about the right size.
[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
Yes, sir.
I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead.
Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
Clarice?
Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
...noted.
You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
Oh, so glad I could help.
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
Really?
[laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes!
Nametag?
You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
To do something about-
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
How about Scrantonstrangler666.
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.
You're not on
Then make him pitch to you.
We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
Oh!
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
I have to put you on with my boss.
Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
You know we live together, right?
I can try. I���m gonna use SMS text.
What? Are there two suns?
Right now!
Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
Nothing. [puts down binoculars]
Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.
They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like���not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor���
Poor little fella.
Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it���s your call.
David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
I probably care more than she does.
I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can]
[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
[whispering] You okay?
Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
Oh. God.
And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.
Every day is black tie optional!
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
It's early bird gets the worm.
[picks up pencil between his toes]
Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
It's in Maryland.
Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]
[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]
Yeah, we���ll see about that.
[smiles]
I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
I'm not answering that. You answer it.
I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
OK.
$200.00
Let the bedbugs bite!
Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
[turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]
And you will be hearing from the -
Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
Thank you.
You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
Andy! [Jim mimes basketball shot]
Not my style.
So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
This is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
What's going on, Michael.  Talk to me.
No!
No way!
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
Yeah.
Vietnam sounds.
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
This is how business...
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
You.
Guten tag, Herr Michael.
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
No holding.
[tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo!
Winners!
I hit a bear.
Which we can't know.
I won't.
Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.
Jim.
Yeah!
I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]
I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
Yes.
It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
The Sting. The Sting.
Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you���re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
You have it?
Admit that there is a chance.
We are going to have two men's rooms.
State your business!
Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
[drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
Hey Jimmy, what's up?
��� 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up]
All right, we're set.
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
Bring him the gabba-gool!
I would like to arrange a truce.
Leave the keys.
Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
I will.
Fosters in the big can.
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
Jeez! What���s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet]
Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
Smile!
[on the phone] Humor works in...
I'll have to talk to the manager.
[Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!
Yes.
I���m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We���ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?
What's the square footage?
How did it go?
You and me, Michael. Yes!
Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
Is that true?
If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
Say it again.
[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
That is so great about the bonus!
OK, everybody just calm down.
N... it's complicated.
Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!
The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?
Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
Please, come back.
Then we meet at the Denny's...
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
���Sedes introiti.��� Seat of entrance.
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning 'Love,' and adelph, meaning 'Adolf.' 'the city that loves Adolf.' Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
Same thing.
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
And I���ve never seen you go to work, ever.
Hey, HEY.
What is wrong with
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So���[clears throat]
Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!
I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
I don't think she'd be missed.
It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
Oh, why not?
[fires tranquilizer gun twice]
You never know. Better safe than sorry.
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.
So what do you want?
I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
Sorry.
What?
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
Really?
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
OK.
Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
Eiffel Tower.
Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there���s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
Alleged contract.
You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
[whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
Hi Michael!
Hey buddy, so every-
I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
No.
Impossible.
I'll be back, I mean...
Oh, I'm equipped... I can...
You���re not getting my clients! Nice try.
[Reading from computer] ���Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!��� That means you can't make me do squat.
[grunting, shouting]
Dammit, Phyllis!
Ahhh.  Mweehaa
And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
[terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
Angela.
American Idol? What? No.
OK, I'm ready.
[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
I hadn't noticed.
Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
It happens occasionally.
Come up with a statement in the next hour....
There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
Would that be such a bad thing?
I want to do this.
Let me describe the perfect date. I take her out to a nice dinner. She looks amazing. Some guy tries to hit on her. Uh, now he wants to fight. So I grab him. I throw him into a jukebox. Then the other ninja's got a knife. He comes at me. We grapple. I turn his knife on him. Blood on the dance floor. She's scared now, I take her home. I'm holding her in my arms. I reach in for a kiss. I hear something in the leaves. I flip her around. She gets a poison arrow right in her back. She was in on it the whole time. But, I knew.
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here���s something. Who would eat who in an ���Alive��� situation. No... that can���t be it.
I could tell, from the body language.
Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
It is so on!
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
Come here. Come here.
No!
Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.
Wait, sales���what sales meeting?
All right. Are you okay?
Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
It was playful hazing.
Oh no, I���m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
Fire hazard.
[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
Cocks in the henhouse.
To be burned!
Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
No thanks.
I am a farmer Angela.
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Move to the exits!
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I���ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
No. [takes a drink]
What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.
I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
Stop it!
Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.
I'm on it!
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Yes!
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
[whispers] Don't let-shh!
Please tell me. I've been so good...
Now, for the last time, I���d like a side salad with balsamic.
Good evening.
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
What are you-
De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Jan Levinson-Gould.
Poor hornet.
Oh, God.
I'll get someone to take it down.
Are you referring to alchemy?
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
���Higher than numbers go.��� The ceiling above accounting!
Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.
Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
No, pictures are too interpretive.
Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]
[pause] What?
Hello, Dwight Schrute?
Ok, ok.
Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
Hey, did you SMS text message me?
The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
[standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement...
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
Excellent.
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
What? Ooh!
Mmhmm.
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
Just admit you lost track of time.
Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
I don���t see it.
I...
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ���em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
Phyllis.
You are?
No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
Step lively. Single file everybody.
It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
[laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh]
Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
I am trying to bring team spirit.
Oh God.
Let���s get him inside.
I got it.
No questions.
Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]
Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you���re so smart. You���re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
I'm stronger.
It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
You are kidding me!
Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
Yes I did.
There you go!
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
Very smart.
Michael.
Dear God in heaven.
So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.
I'm kneading it!
Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
OK.
Uh huh.
Woo-hoo.
Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I���ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
Good old Mose. [laughing]
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
[Toby uses tester on wall as Erin marks wall with red tape X] Oh, god.
Is that what we were doing?
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
Packer.
I got floor.
Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
Uh-huh.
Shh. Do you hear that?
How dare you?
Well, I���m the one offering the job.
I just saved your life. You���re welcome!
Wait, I got it! Confirmation code: XV2RDM!
Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
[tests smoke detector] Good.
Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
Good.
While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? [Pretends to be on phone] ���Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.��� It's that easy.
That's our theme.
So who will be your new Number Three?
That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.
Three to four hours.
And who is this 'the' Steve Nash?
Well, don't look, freak!
Cool.
No.
Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, 'muffin basket.' Then I thought, 'What���s even more precious to people than muffins?'
Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
No! Michael, no!
What the? [follows Nellie into the break room]
Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
Ha! I don't get it.
I never said it was better than an iPod.
[Dwight come into office unshaven]  What?
That's on a need-to-know basis.
Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.
She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
You believe a computer can beat me?
Your clients. They're all mine.
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
That was your idea.
[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
And they said it couldn���t be done. Boom!
Yeah!
Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
Oh.
It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow]
No! Really?
Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
Those are fighting words.
It's close.
You don't work with us.
Your own paper company.
She should thank me.
Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
Please sir! Spare him. Please.
I can't say [clearinng throat noise]?
[drinks] Mmmmm...
[stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!
[on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?
Who took all the black ones?
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
All their top clients I can't believe it.
Humans are terrible for the environment.
Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.' You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
Kids? You don't even have a girlfriend.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
How long has he been in the bathroom?
Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
Sure.
Sounds fair to me, David.
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
Where are we going?
Just for fun?
Oscar...
Pam, information is power.
How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that���s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
Those who can't farm, farm celery.
No, it's... involves the photograph.
[shakes fist, whispers] Yeah!
Are you nuts?
My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
What?
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?
Does he have access to their medical records?
Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
You should ask her out.
[whispering] Say you're sorry times infinity...
Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.
Like a wolf. Thank you.
The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
Emergency dentist appointment.
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]
People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
Yes.
Who's doing the presentations?
No.
And for���oh, whoopsie daisy. [chuckles]
Woo! Okay!
That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!
Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
Let's get back to work.
Either he goes, or I go.
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I���m finished, it���s over.
You stop.
Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
Angry.
Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It���s called ���Schrute or Consequences.��� You���re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
On your marks, get set...
In your face!
I���d have to get some more wire and string, but it���s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
Boo, unimpressed. It���s a tightrope for babies. Boo!
Lock your door!
Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
What are you mumbling about?
So you're taking a personal day?
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
You are the master.
They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
[same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...
Do you
That's preposterous.
You!
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
It's from both of us.
[sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
Hey. [shuts door] Is everything okay?
God. How do whalers do it?
Sure
That���s me.
The truth.
Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
No, Michael.
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I���ve ever made.
There's one more suggestion.
Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
[pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty.
I don���t need your help.
...confess to health care fraud.
I am ready for my performance review.
My cousin Mose told me a joke.
You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
You can't steal what is legally your property.
Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!
I know that. Don't you think I know that?
Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
What?
Yes.
[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?
Merry Christmas. Good.
Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
Am I nomadic?
I have no way of knowing if that's true.
No! [arguing over each other]
Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review.
[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.
No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
Are you near sighted or far sighted?
Oh, I'm OK.  I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
You made a big mistake. Huge!
Danger.
Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
Male, age 37...
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Done.
Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.
[looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one.
[scoffs]
That's a ridiculous question.
Okay.
Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
So am I.
No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
Yeah, deal with it Pam!
Rhythm and blues...
Good, do you see what I'm saying?
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]
I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
How you doing, Jordan?
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
Pam is down for anything.
Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
A bat! Impressive...
I want to see the baby.
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
Yeah!
Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]
OK
Do you have the Sharpie?!
[in disgust] Oh...
No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
[singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
Good night.
Not now, Temp.
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
Coolio. Coolio.
You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession?
[excited] Get out! I���m a dad!
Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.
I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
Oh, no!
Friends with a hobbit.
Cherry Pie, Warrant.
No.
Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
You've got a ton of dandruff.
We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]
And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
We all have a hero in our heart.
What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.
No. Phyllis, you're not...
Oh, man, never thought I���d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]
[exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive.
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor]
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
Not literally.
I hope there will be management parables.
No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.
In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
What does it say?
So I can lower it.
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Not now! Private time!
Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
Jan knows paper.
[answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
Not my urine.
Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
One minute ago.
[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
I sure do.
Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]
Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
You already said deal.
Right. Which one is that?
Oh, our contract.
Don't lose your head.
Take a good look at this boy...
Jim, what are you doing?
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].
Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]
[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
Excellent.
Yes.
Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
[duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]
Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.
Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.
Some of these people are for real.
Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
Let's single...
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
Yes.
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
Cut.
Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
What's it of?
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
Woohoo! Yes!
Really?
Oh.
Mmmnnnnmmm...
It is?
When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
We thought that she was you.
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
[on the phone] ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber.
Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
Ready?!
Sorry.
[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.
He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!
Yeah.
[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
This is where I saw that deer last week.
Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
You haven't buried her yet?
Mi-
I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.
This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
Yeah, let's go.
Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
I don't know...
Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Yeah...
Yeah, and we���re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
[looks over and sees hole in his present]  Crap.  [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up]  Come here you.
You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
Come here, I���ll show you.
What's going on in here?
Cause you're sweeter than candy.
Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
What are the specs?
Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
Screwed.
What-
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].
Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
Well, I���ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.
Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
[typing] Okay, let me finish this thought.
[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
Ok, let him know that I'm here.
Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
What is it?
So tape it down.
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
[alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake.
Welcome.
Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.
You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
Hello, Angela.
We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone]
I have to have an emergency crown put in.
Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
Oh my God.
Michael? Please! Come on!
Battlestar Galatica.
Maybe if you listened a little bit, you���d improve. No wonder women despise you.
We did it, we did it. I love you.
Okay, here���s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can���t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]
Sh-what?
Menstrual cycles.
How ya doin'?
Can I drive?
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
Still.
That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
Well...
Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too 'meh' or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing 'I wear makeup'] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
None of your business.
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long.
[clapping] Whoo!
No, Kevin, come on.
What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
No!
He looks great.
Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.
Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me.
Way to go.
Loser.
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
Oh.
How long before?
Found him!
You apologize right now.
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet���.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]
Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...
Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It���s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]
But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
Listening.
[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
That���s right. Will you just give us a second?
Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
Never!
He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
Did you enjoy your lunch?
Okay, really?
That's what she said.
My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
He --
What do you mean?
Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
Queen bee.
It's a terrible idea.
[show her the wound] Oh God.
[whispering] But what if i'm hungry?
I am not.
Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'IT WAS DWIGHT' written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
Don���t listen to him.
Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
OK, I accept it.
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
Oh God... ��Hey no! Where do you think you���re going? You���ve gotta stay for the big presentation we���ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He���s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
Yes. Fast food. I���ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
Uh, Oh.
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
What did I say!?
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
Maybe you do. Hi. I���m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It���s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
The buyer is your sister���s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that���s an order.
Oh, no.
From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!
No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.'
[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
Question? May I investigate?
In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.
There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.
This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it���s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It���s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It���s for a disorder of the mind.
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
Whoa. Michael.
It's a lullaby.
Dwight Schrute.
Oh come on.
I'm sorry it makes me nervous.
Hey, we nailed the sale!
He says, 'No!' Boom!
Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
OK, temp.
I'm not familiar with that expression,
What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
There it is. [everyone applauds]
She's not here, Jim.
A thousand times more.
I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
That's what I said.
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
Everything's a joke.
Well, we���re both just kinda learning as we go, aren���t we?
Excellent.
I know.
[singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
[off screen] What are you guys talking about?
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
Good night.
I don't get to wear my ties.
[scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
No, I have not.
I do not respect her, but I will go.
[sighs]
[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
Right, standard.
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
But this isn���t interim manager. No. It���s Dwight K. Schrute��� [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
Uhh-mmm [moaning]
Disarm!
You're welcome.
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
No.
I...
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
No.
Waste of a good hatchet.
Right...
Shh, shh, shh.
No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I���ll be right back.
[to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.
Um.
Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]
You did not just say that! You don���t know Pam. She is really cool.
I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
Interesting choice...
I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
No.
In a way it���s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they���ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I���ll have a grandson.
I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
Aaaarrhh!  [kicks over Christmas tree]
Ahh-chaa!
You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
Let it out.
No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
Oh Pam.
Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
Not my problem.
What'd he say? What did he say?
Say it. Do it. Now.
I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That's good. That's good.
Really?
[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her.
[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]
Aren't they magnificent?
I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.
Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
Oh, that's perfect!
Who is this?
[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.
Whassup.
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
What did you just call him?
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
With my leads and stuff like that?
Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
That is my stapler.
Think!
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
Mmm. That���s a good��� question. 300 times��� [Jim hangs up] 180��� Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
You got a better way?
Doesn't matter.  I'll escort you!
What is this?
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
What did you do?
I'm not answering it.
Getting defensive?
Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
Get in.
What?
Michael.
Schrute. Mister Schrute.
Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]
Give me the dice.
Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
You know where it is. Lead me there.
Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
Nash.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]
Oh, nothing much. What's up with you?
Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
He took my desk.
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...
Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
I can't let you in, Michael.
You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves]
I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?
Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
Let's talk pubes, people.
Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
Me! Me, me, me.
I wanted to offer you a new position.
You may have...
Nice.
Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]
I volunteered for this job.
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
Yes!
My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
I'm doing my job.
Hey.
We need to talk!
Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?
It's not locked, gimme that...
[Holds his finger to Jim's lips] Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim]
I hate her too.
The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, ���perfect pork anus��� which I don't mean.
How much do you have?
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
It just doesn't add up.
Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?
I don't understand the reference.
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
���Gy-na��� said that?
Yes.
The democratic primaries,
Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.
...their own children.
Wolves.
Surveillance, gaming- and business.
[over phone] Hey-O!
Don't make me pre-fire you.
I���m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?
[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
Did you get anything good?
Um, what about you?
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
Oh, I doubt you���ll make it. Very few do who���ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you���ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
Oh, great. He���s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
How as being a minority affected you?
I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
Yes!
Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.
I���m sorry. I���ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?
Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I���m sure he���d give a reference.
[On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
Like hell you are.
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don���t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
Yeah? Like what?
Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
I can't see.
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
How dare you all attack him like this.
Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
Oh...
I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
Aaaaaaaa!
Where were you yesterday after work?
Tent, rainfly, gorp...
It's, it's latched closed.
I was aware that you were speaking.
They should not be in that room.
Nice.
Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.
Thank you.
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
Hazel.  They're hazel.
[quietly] Phyllis?
You were making me do things that were not all right.
Hey!
That's bad.
Hey.
Not what I asked.
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
F. Alright, what's the damage?
Yeah, right.
What do you know?
Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
It's true.
What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
Uh-huh.
That���s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Wait, canine AIDS?
How do you spell 'animalian'?
Oh I am. In my own words.
pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.
So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
I can see that as a very real possibility.
[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
Yeah. What?
It means ���excellent���. And we have begun.
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here���s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
Would you like the stink sack?
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
Always. [runs off]
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
Very funny, Michael!
OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
I had fish yesterday.
Oh.  Meh.
Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
Where?
Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.
One...
We had already applauded.
[Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, 'Kind of.'
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
[runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.
Do it now.
I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Give me the punch card.
Its Jim and Pam, Michael.
Ha, nerd.
She had a hysterectomy.
I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
Please Michael, please.
Head towards the exits.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe it's what she does here...
Number one!!
It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
What is the antidote?
Very good.
You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]
Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.
That���s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.
Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...
Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]
It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
No, you can stop.
What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
Now what?
Ho, thirty years.
Yes.
What kind of mileage does this baby get?
There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
P.S. We should should kill him.
Peepa, how is she?
I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.
Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
Just for a minute.
You don't work here! You're not Jim!
Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
Tape recorder.
Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]
Thank you. [everyone begins to leave]
Just say it.
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.
What?
I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
It is the situation that we are in now.
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
Clarinet.
Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?
[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can���t believe you came.
I know that's what he said.
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They���re not for me. They���re for my cousin Mose. He���s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
Horse Boat.
[running from his desk] Ayyyy!
Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.
You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
Do you need anything?
Okay.
You just said it. You just said it.
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?
So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
From when he recommended me to replace him.
No, no, no, no...
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
[Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
I've got a treat for you!
I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
Smells like it.
I was here first.
Turn it around. Turn it around.
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
Fine.
This is the lake!
Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
[yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
I have no idea.
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
It���s by the tenderloin.
Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
[creepy smile]
I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.'
OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
You see?
Ready?
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
Ok.
You've got to tell Andy about us.
This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
Yes!
Is it?
Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]
Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.
[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
He sure left in a hurry.
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
[alarm sounds] People!
Thank you, Andy.
Ooh, I love repartee.
[lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]
Shhh, Pam. C���mon, don���t be such a right-sider.
Seriously?
What's the plan?
English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
Michael.
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
Six percent, I know my worth.
What?
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
What?
Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
No.
Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won���t be necessary tonight.
No, impish or admirable.
No, no, no.
Here we go. Make a wish.
Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.
Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
Yes. Of course.
TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You'll be back.
[scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
No.
That���s true.
Just hush.
What is it? Who wrote it?
Impish or admirable.
Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
Damn it! Perfect answer, again.
I don't know.
Stupid.
Two forms of ID, please.
I'm a huge fan.
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
No.
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.
No.
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
[sighs] Now, how can I help you?
Awww!
Please.
The Dundies!
What?
Robert! Robert California! Robert!
Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
Got it. [Andy's hand goes up]
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
Do you accept?
Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes.  Also.
No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
What belt are they?
You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
There���s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
[sighs] This is your job, Halpert.
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
Time for me to find out.
Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
Does that include the garage?
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]
This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
Kelly is the only applicant.
I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I'm in pain.
As has Angela!
...with you. [chuckles]
Men find me desirable.
Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
[over phone] Who is that monkey?
She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
[loudly applauds] Yes.
The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
Uh, it's not totally empty.
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.
Zeke.
[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?
You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
That's where they remove the uterus.
He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
I do!  I want some man meat!
Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
If you want to tell me -
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
Okay, okay. That's enough.
Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
Mega-Desk.
[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
[laughing together] Yeah!
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Michael-
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Paranoid? I���m not familiar with the word. And I really don���t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
[outside] Come on, hurry up you guys!
I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ��� What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Saturday.
Well today���s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger���s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
You failed?
Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
You don't have email on your phone.
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
Hey. Hey. Jerry.
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Do you have the Sharpie?!
And this chair���s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
Okay, this isn���t working for me, ���cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
We better.
No, no. No spoilers. Please.
But check that it's covered by your
Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands]
What---
I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
Wow.
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.
No thank you.
Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes.
Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
Oh, yes.
Andy.
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
He knew all along!
Yes. Anything.
You must use a lot of paper.
So I���ve got your resume here, but it���s not telling me everything.
Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
This is not Mega-Desk.
Oh my god.
Ok, give that back to me.
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
No, no. No margarita. Hot sake.
As Assistant Regional Manager...
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
No.
Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I���m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
[imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls]
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
Hola, tu es une buena worker?
You didn't have to...
It's true. We all walk alone.
Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?
Listen to me! I love you! And I don���t care that Phillip���s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager���s job?
Unlikely.
Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
Good. [Pam overhears]
The new IT guy. Nick.
Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
Eh, it's not worth it.
I've got the key.
Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
He wasn't volunteering today.
Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
That's good, let's wrap it up.
[into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
Karen Filippelli.
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
So what kind of commissions you get up there?
Mm, good stuff.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
This ought to be good.
So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
What?
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
[as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.
[reading the note with the gay-dar]  'Hope this helps.  -Jim'  Nice!
Come on, break this up.
Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose]
I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
Oh give me a break.
I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
Check it out.
No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.
You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
Answer me this, though.
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
What... [mumbling]
I don���t know, what do you mean?
...never been lower!
Not! [scoffs]
Really?
Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
Is this your car, Ryan?
Oh, thank you.
Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
Vegetarian?
Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?
You know what?
[leaving] We'll bill you.
Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.
So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
What are you doing?
If you fall in love with her.
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
Pleasure.
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
Trees!  And where do trees grow?
Yeah.
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
It was rotting.
Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.
But then no one can see us.
Sure. That'd be fine.
Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?
That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
Yes!
[whispers] I���d love to invest.
Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.
All right.
Do you love her?
[laughs while spray painting ���Jim is Awesome��� on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
Jim.
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]
No.
I think it did.
I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
Any employee may dispose a food item...
Me too. [smirking]
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.
Hold still, woman!
Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
I'll order you some cranberry juice.
Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!
He's very, very handsome.
Terrible mistake.
Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don���t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So��� have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let���s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So���yes. I���d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
My eyes!
Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Very well.
Yeah- oh!
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
Could be a bat weevil��� Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.
Xterra's not even a real word.
You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]
I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.
I don't want to do this.
No!
Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
I got a knock-knock joke.
What?
[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
Move to the side of the road!
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
That's Andy Bernard.
This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
Damn.  [thinks]  I'll try Brookstone.
Move it! One, two, three. [grunts]
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
[snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.
Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.
Leave, get outta here.
Mm, great cake.
No.
Don't you dare! Andy!
What are you saying?
....back orders and you never called them.
Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.
Cats don't make butter.
Get in!
Fine, let���s go. [grunts]
Angela, what about you?
That's how it's done.
Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.
What?
From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
Mose, bags! Now!
Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
Dry. Delicious.
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
The most important one of the guys.
Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah!  Aa-aaah! [throws it ahead of the car, it goes for a while and then is stopping]  It's a hardy stroller. [takes watermelon out of stroller, holds it up to show camera] Maybe it's safe!
Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
Gosh. He he.
[to old man] Okay, you're done.
Come on.
I was just showing her my belt.
Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Ok
Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
Where? Dark side or light side?
What was your mile time?
Good luck, Michael.
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
Oh, I���m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I���m not in your panties, I don���t go vigilantes. Why don���t you ask your husband?
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
[giggles]
Parley, my office, five minutes.
Andy is complicating things.  But I'm not worried.  This will only up my game.
Next suggestion.
There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
Jeb, my brother.
Do it.
...because you are never going to see him again.
What?
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
Sure.
Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.
Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
I'm not gonna say it.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]
Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
Okay, I���m a woman. [high voice] I���m a woman. Good?
Hey, Michael.
Undistributable.
No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.
The temp.
So?
Guys, it wasn���t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn���t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
Michael!?
My idea!
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.
Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?
What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.
Let's go.
Watch this.
Who is the king of England?
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
We're here. [gets out of the car]
Okay, go ahead, they're right.
You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...
I'm gonna answer Charles first.
David.
[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.
[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...
And you'll compare the times?
The target-- it���s Oscar, isn���t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
Nine and three-quarters.
You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
Yeah.
So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
Woohoo!
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
What's next?
And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
[scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don���t try planking. It���s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ���Specially with me around.
This is how I breathe.
Just slip it off my���Slip it off my hips.
So who are we laughing at?
So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
What are you doing?
Good shocks.
Define foment.
Smasher? No, where���d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city���s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
No problem.
400 and one penny.
Terrible!
Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
Please, I'll make you proud.
[scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.
Oh. I got it.
Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: There���s a madman in our midst.
Dammit! [hangs up]
He's heading downtown.
You wanted to see me?
Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Maybe you've got mono.
How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]
Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ���I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt��� unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?
Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]
[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]
I am a Sheriff's Deputy.
[Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.
You liked it!
What? It's a casual, social outfit.
Wait, what Holly said?
[both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
Oh.
Yeah.
No!
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
Who are you?
Answer me.
Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
Oh, no, no, no. It���s good. It���s really -- on the Internet, it���s a really -- that���s a really good, good, thing.
No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand]
What about your party?
No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert���s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
OK, what am I thinking right now?
To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
No.
OK!
This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
Can I have an office?
Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
Surprise! [laughs]  Everybody!
[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
Wow, that���s great. That���s great. Ok, good, let���s talk about that, ok?
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
Wow.
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that���s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
So, you--
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.
And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
Oh good. She broke up with you.
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
Him or me?
I was talking to myself.
You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
Michael?
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
He even looks like a mole.
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
What? No, but I --
Come on. I'll drive.
Oh.
[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]
I don't know.
OK, can we steer away from gay people?
[Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]
There you go.
Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]
Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]
The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
Tom?
Okay.  Fine.
Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
I'm about to buy this building, you know.
Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
Yeah.
One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
I do!
Oh, dear God in heaven.
It's simpler this way.
Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
Tell him to stop.
Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
Right.
Come on.
I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.
Gimli.
It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?
Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]
No!
It's in my purse.
What a courageous venture.
Is this Jan?
When? When did he tell you? Today?
Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
[angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
Thank you very much.
I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
Hoist his shank on three.
You should go.
Michael, we have a situation.
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
Very excited?
They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
I wish I could menstruate.
Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
Oh my goodness.
[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!
Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?
Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
Aaaaah!
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
That!
It can���t be nothing.
Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
Hello.
Really funny, Michael!
With all my heart.
David, is that you?
Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
Really?
Get in the car.
Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!
Wow.
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices]
[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]
It'll all be goat.
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
--to use sudden violence.
And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
Gotcha! Yeah! Let���s see ya get out of this web, huh?
Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?
Thank you. I mean, I���ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh���
Hey, hey.
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
[shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
We heard it was called red-vining.
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
Kind of.
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
Same page. Just keep moving.
No. She needs her rest again.
Empty mind.
Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
...I'll consider it.
I checked it more than once.
Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
DRAW SOME BLOOD!
We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
Yes, I do.
[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.
Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.
Angela...
...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
No. [typing on keyboard]
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they���re protecting America���s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day���s security codes. Something that���s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It���s not the KGB, but it���s a start.
Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
What?
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
This is not at drill!
No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
It���s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
For reha-
I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
He used to fight dogs.
Get your foot behind the yellow line.
What position did you use to conceive?
Inspiration.
Okay, listen. I���m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I���ve never actually done this before.
I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
[on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman!
Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
Oh, no. What?
Hey. Come on, buddy. Let���s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don���t compare. When you���re with the R-O-L-F, you���re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
Copy.
You would?
When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
Oh��� really.
[to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]
What do you have in mind?
It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
What?
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
Me.
Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
[Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
Wait, what?
[wails arms] You know, selling, typing, dialing.
Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don���t see them so I think we���re good.
Please?
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
Let's get this roof going.
Do it.  Promote me.  Tri-managers.
Oh no, that is too bad.  Shoot.
In juvie.
Got it.
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.
[cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?
Is that a sumo suit?
I know. That���s not why I���m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]
Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
[singing]  ... Marilyn Monroe!
Like an AIDS test?
Bow down before Recyclops.
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
Care for a piece of chocolate?
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]
Okay, who moved my desk?
So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good.
Phyllis, no. No.
You're back.
Fine!
I wish I could hire all of you.
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
[spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah!
[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.
Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
Yes!
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
Just a possibility.
What's up-dog?
What else?
[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!
It���s moments away. Just stay here!
I'm... I was making it.
You're wearing loafers!
OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
What's our presentation about?
Everyone.
Come on Clark!
Does Michael talk about
Hello.
We have better service than they do!
Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
That was the last signature I needed.
Nice.  Do you have any blonde women?
Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
You apologize to me right now.
You speak English?
No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
I....
Got it.  Carb up.
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
Michael!
Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.
Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
It was nothing personal. It���s just that you were terrible at your job.
I date Indian girls.
Uh, better ask Jim.
It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?
As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
Please.
I smell mold.
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?
[chokes up]
Very well, we will come back at 5:15.
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
Come on. Nice try, Josh!
Damn it!
It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]
Assistant regional manager.
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
I think she's efficient.
Did you do her?
I can handle that.
My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.
They're testing it now.
Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
And not come through for you?
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
It can���t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
Well... it's my own fault.
Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
Take six.
Search his things.
Exactly. Yes.
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
Want to take a rake... .
Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can���t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
All right! What is going on here?
I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
Well ���
Michael, I need to talk to you.
Oh. [dumps drink out]
Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
[struggling] Ahh! I can't-
No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it.
He/she/it throat rips.
Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
Happy birth moment, Michael.
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
No.
Hey.
Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.
Damn it. God!
Into your-
Good.
Very well.
Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
[laughs] Right? Come on!
No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]
Seven? Can I finish please?
What about you?
He said he would do the same for me.
What?
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?
Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
Let's go.
That is so cool.
I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ���The Grass Roots��� in the 1960���s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
No, you stop.
No! No, no! [groans]
There's no gum. There never was any gum.
The eyes are the groin of the head.
Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
It will just take a second.
No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
Losers.
Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.
Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he���s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
Five minutes exactly.
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
Hey, Andy.
I know.
No. That is not a toy.
Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]
It was pretty awesome.
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
[bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
I do.
Store only has three employees.
That would be nice wouldn't it?
Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.
[innocently] How'd that get there?
Or get hit by a car-
Hey, it just takes one!
The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
Go!
Also, it's icky back there.
What do you want!?!
Okay.
I'll do the best I can.
Stanley.
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it���s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
Standing.
Oh, not gonna happen.
Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
You didn't poison me, it's just stress.
If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
Exactly.
He���s fine. He gets carsick really easily.
What's this? What is this?
You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
Iris, thank you so much for having me.
What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
You are clean. Okay��� One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
Just ignore him.
I already made an appointment��� with your secretary.
Here's another place.
I have crossbows.
Really shove it.
Know what?
Party's over. You are so busted!
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool.
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
Well I'm not responsible for that!
Damnit! Damnit Jim!
Thank you.
Well, I did it too.
Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus?
Michael?
Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could���ve choked so many people by now.
Let���s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
Sniffling how?
Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ��We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
Fifty L.
Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
She's sleeping with you?
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
I'm on it.
Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]
Nice to see you. May I hold him?
Come -- come with me.
Have you finished with the sketch?
It's a statement of fact.
It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
I want a truce.
I'll do--
Ah, much, ok.
OK. Good night Ryan.
Jan, have you ever had deer?
Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
How do I become a manger at Sabre?
Rolph, leave it alone!
Oh, come on. I���ve never heard of such a thing.
Shut up.
Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]
Spin move.
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
By hand.
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight]
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
It's a divet...
Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
Do you love me or not?
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.
Go on.
Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don���t quit your day job.
My eyes!
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
What?
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
Awesome.
Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
They are either going to say yes... or no.
What is your weapon?
Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
Ingredients.
You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
Okay.
What makes you think you���d be an effective paper salesman?
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.
Part of my job.
It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
Opus dei.
So don't.
It's fine. What?
Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
OK, this is stupid.
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
Please.
Can I do some of the talking?
Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
What?
Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.
You have your lawyer there?
Get out of here moron! [Jim leaves]
Drop this one. Abort.
That's an excellent analogy.
Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind.
Stop ordering me around, Jim!
I don���t like him either. ��And yet I really like him.
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don���t even care about nationals.
Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk]
Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Yes you will.
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.
No.
Silence?
[laughs] What do you think?
OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
And their king bee.
Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
No I don't.
No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?
Sure.
He hung up?
Excellent question.
Cause you���re interested in going into sales?
[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
[to Packer] Silence.
Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Coolio.
[sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
That's because they're easy!
No.
[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
Come on. Come on.
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
That���s it.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]
What are you doing?
You���re not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela]
That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?
[to troy] Do you have powers?
[moans] Scranton rules! [sprays Silly Spray]
Yes.
Yeah!
[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
No, it���s not. Here���s how we find out. Let���s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let���s just size each other up here and left side of the list��� ATTACK!
I got it here.
OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
You think I don���t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I���ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne���er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don���t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.
Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
Do this. Come on. Ready?
Mmhmm.
No you can't do that.
Reply it!
Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
Michael, what time should I be arriving?
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
Let���s just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice]
You're good.
Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
Hey buddy.
Uh huh.
I want him to have all the urine he needs.
I call for a refold!
No, why were you in there?!
What? Shirts on or off?
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
Really?
Here they come.
You are an impressive specimen.
Oh, please.
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
Come on old lady. Let's go.
[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There���s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ���the White Whale���. Look at all that sweet blubber.
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
[on the phone]  Hey, what's up, kid?
Have you collected the money from everyone?
The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'
I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]
[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
Thanks for meeting me.
A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.
Michael, come on.
Yeah.
No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.
Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
[surprised] Ah!
...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
[whispering] I don���t know. I just don���t know.
No, Pam.
He doesn't like it.
I���d like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]
What's so funny?
She probably scrubbed it
Jim, you're the new schedule guy, huh?
[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]
[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
Okay.
[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
No it is not.
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Okay, I���m gonna need you to print it out.
These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
No, you're not because I spent hours on it.
Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
[bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.
Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
Yeah.
Okay, what's next?
Michael!  What's wrong?
Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
So why is this on your resume? [door slams]
Kelly?
What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan]
Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
Alien
You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
You're the one who trained me, Michael.
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]
Why?
[falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
Aye.
[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
More of a, barbaric growl.
Damn it!
Two charges of loitering,
I do not have a knife!
No, no, no, no! You don���t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There���s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don���t have diplomatic relations.
you said to just...
For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...
[holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.
Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.
[looks to Angela]
Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
This party is going to be awesome.
Jim, are you serious?
Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby.
Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
I'm just --
[trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's 'Let's Get Physical' starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
Uhh.
Sabotage.
Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
Wrestle him to the ground.
Damn it!
That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
I choose Michael!
[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.
Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before.
Erin....the receptionist!
My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
Mmm-hmm.
Damn straight.
Oh no! Jan!?  What's goin' on?
Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.
I will never be your vichyssoise.
Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
Action.
Yeah, that'll work.
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Who is Justice Beaver?
What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.
Really? That���s interesting. ���Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who���s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
Judas.
Damn it!
Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
Movie idea?
This interview is over. I'll let you know.
Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
Don���t!
[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
No, no, don't, don't tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
You're gonna need to be more specific.
[to Nellie] I told you.
You don't like the Beatles?
Cut.
Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
Look, I will not pay.
Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel.
Okay.
I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
Bye poochie!
Cow, goat or sheep.
Stop forgetting things.
Wow!
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
Not all the time.
[Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?
I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
Aah!
Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Don't be mad, it is a business trip.
Yes.
Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
Thank you.
Marching or garage?
What for? We haven���t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren���t deep fried, right?
If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam's shoulders] You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
What?
Hee-heeding this right now.
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
Oh, man, am I a woman?
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car.
Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
Thank you.
[still off screen] Carol had a mustache?
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Don���t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]
Okay.
Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
Get...
A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
Good. Good. And...
The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'
I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.
Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
Stop acting like an idiot!
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
Can I use your phone?
Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?
Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager���s office before?
I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Really make one.
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
I need you to hose my aunt.
Oh, god, this again? You���re Stinky.
Of course.
OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]
Thank you very much for that.
Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Jim, get him a water.
[smiles knowingly]
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
[on phone] Dwight Schrute.
Yes. I would welcome it.
I can't. I can't push harder!
My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.
Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
Hurl your feces.
[takes contract] Absolutely, I will.
That's just a verb.
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
[In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
I could have stopped him.
[playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
What are you doing?
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
No, but we should discuss that another time.
Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?
Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
I don't know.
Okay, let's go.
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
[sighs] It's firm.
We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.
Yes, Monkey.
Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
Wait, shut up.
[applause] Yes! Thank you!
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'
I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back]
Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
YEAH!
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They���ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ���em on in there.
BAT!
Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
That's not why you lost.
Got it. Go.
Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
Did you say Karen?
God... Damn it! Why us?
I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible 'Jim faces']
I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Okay, hey, hey, hey...
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
Kung-fu movies!
So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
I'm losing control of my bladder.
Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.
What?
I started a fire with my cheese pita.
Weird.
KGB.
Oh, don���t worry. They���ll get got.
Okay, why are you calling Jo?
Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don���t know where I���d put you.
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
That never happened. He���s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ���saving treats��� from the kitty litter box.
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
I have a copy of your key.
I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
No.
Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
The power source.
That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
Limbo, whoo!
Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
Deceit does not come easy to me.
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
Interviewer has suspect motives.'
Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.
To socialize.  And inform.
Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
Frosting.
What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.
Yeah.
Take me to Robert.
Oh, good, and you resent this because...
Yes. Yes.
You're supposed to be a cat?
Excuse me, I got a question for you.
And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.
Hello.
It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
What?
Waste of time.
Eager.
Crowd control, directing traffic...
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
Oh.
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
No.
Yes! Andy, get out here.
Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]
Huh. Do you like candy?
How is he gonna have grandkids?
You took something that doesn't belong to you.
Meat grinder.
Jim is essential to th-
I am cool.
Has Michael checked in?
Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
Dry rot?
[Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!
You're twenty minutes late!
Great idea.
What?
When no one hedded--
Look, I have no problem with women. It���s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don���t lie about your shoulders!
[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?
Go move some paper!
And your veil.
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
No.
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, 'that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.' And I said, 'I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.' Well, hello Danny!
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.
Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
Like Angela in accounting.
Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I���m telling you... if you don���t do this, [whispers] I don���t stand a chance. Please, Jim.
No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
Little of this, little of that.
The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
I gave her a higher clearance than you.
No.
You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
That���s really rude.  I don���t tell you hurricanes suck even though it���s true.
It's okay, I smell.
I'll do a shot, Michael.
Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
Who was the second man on the moon?
So you excited?
Yeah. I can barely...
25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face.
Give me it. I am not.
What do you think I am saying to you?!
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
You know what? I made you a cd...
Well...
And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
But I'm right?
I can't-
It's not what you think.
Who's the target?
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
Thank you, Michael.
Really?  Anything.
I want to be here when you fire her ass.
Don't even care!
So sexy it becomes hostile.
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
[sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.
Excuse me sir.
The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
Not a viable option.
Diversifying. Smart.
No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
I'm fine, I'm totally fine.
Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me!
You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
So we know which truck to van...
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
Con artist.
Oh, tips are expected?
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
[gets up from chair] Write legibly people.
It does, but still no.
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]
You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
Great.
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
Pam, I'll help you.
[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody's found the hog maw.
Keep an existing...
Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
Coopers has calamari.
Don���t be an idiot. It���s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you���ve been here. That���s the max.
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
What?
It���s a youtube thing! Let���s go. Let���s go. Come on, they���re coming.
Say no more.
Ah.
All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
Fax this for me.
I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn���t you say?
Come on!
Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
It's in the name.
You're the stupid one.
Put your fingers here.
Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
None of your business.
I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]
It's actually better this way.
Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and���
No!
It���s 15 feet down, it���s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it���s like your catching a medicine���
[coughing]
Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
What's this?
Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance.
Or none of you [chuckles]
Go, get up there right now.
What?
Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim���s leg.
It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
Give me the phone.
Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog. [runs with stroller]  Oh, no!  Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer [forcefully pushes stroller away toward uneven ground with junk strewn around, the stroller hits some junk, stays upright, and stops safely]
Michael is your superior.
Oh [half-heartedly throws something]
Yes!
I'm... discombobulated.
Hey stranger.
Right. Highways or surface roads?
Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!
That���s right Jim.
That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]
Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
Excuse me?
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Could I have a copy of one of them?
Sign it.
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
You want me to flush him?
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
Congratulations.
[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
Family only.
[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late.
He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm]
Jim, this is hardly the time.
Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
Do the monkey face!
Hoist him aloft. C���mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]
[chuckles]
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.
Then I will.
[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
...the fact...
Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?
Assistant Sensei.
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
Mm-hmm. Good luck.
Why?
Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
Psh, why is that great?
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
Ok, tell him that's not true.
Including prep time?
[whispering] You set a date?
Oh we know.
You remember my cousin Mose.
[punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]
Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
Yes, you did.
Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]
OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.
If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
Okay?
Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.
Hey.
Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
Okay.
Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over.  I'm sorry.
700 and one penny.
Stay out of this, you!
I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
Shotgun weddings.
I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
Pfft, ���Athlead���? Please. They���re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ���Stumpany,��� for ���Stupid Company.���
Well played.
Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
[grunts] Okay, we���re good. We���re good. Let���s go. Push!
[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
Now. Now. Now.
That's exactly the point.  You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know-
[laughs] No!
Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Have you seen Erin?
Okay.
It's close.
Woo!
Done.
Okay---
Oh, man, am I a woman?
Nope, I wasn't bitten.
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again]
Where is my desk?
Who, me?
[removes glasses] I am the bait.
You had to, what other choice did you have?
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
Don't do it!
What?
We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
Sounds like a plan.
All right.
Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
Oh... Narcolepsy.
[talking over Michael] Nice.
I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
Daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare���s milk?
It's pony.
No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk]
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM!  Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM! [pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.
Make way, nope, inspect me.
I have two. White and Indian.
I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.
Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]
God, you're such a spy.
No.
To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
That is impossible.  Unless you mean gonorrhea.
It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?
Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
[whispers] Oh D.
[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing 'Centerfold.'] They might be listening to us.
I want that vice-presidency.
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!'
[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
What!
I don't need a key.
[looking up at Creed] Dad?
Anything else would be inconsistent.
Then I would bring an axe, no books.
Apology rejected.
Huh?
We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
Such a chorus girl.
Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
I don't believe you. Continue.
Hello.
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Don't set it to yourself!
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.'
Is it called red-vining?
Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
I miss her so much.
This is exciting! You���re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Yeah, Meredith.
That shady grove out by Willard's pond.
What?
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
[clears throat]
Andy I���m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
Why's he talking to Holly?
No! No, Oscar. He���s a friend. He���s a friend.
Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]
Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?
I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
Kevin! Do more stupid faces.
What?
When is the guest of honor coming?
No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]
Text went through.
Dunder-Mifflin.
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Go put them all in random order.
That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
Sorry.
Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!
In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I���m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there���s a mini-reunion. A kind of a ���where are they now��� panel at a local theatre. It���ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven���t seen Kevin since we let him go.
Yeah! [laughing]
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
What?
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
[whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
What's your blood type?
What?
Okay.
I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
What?
-But we'll be together then-'
Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
[interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
No.
Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
Hey buddy, what are you up to?
[grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.
I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
No, panic is warranted!
So���
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I'm really sorry... about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.
He���s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
[Bus pulls into lot] Bring it in!
The leads are in?
Thank you Michael.
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
[scores] Yes!
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
I left a message at corporate.
It���s just one thing. Just let me���let me do this���
It���s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I���d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
Oh, don���t lie. I���m trying to save those precious knees you���re always bragging about. ��Now, let���s get out of here. He could be right behind us.
[places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
[walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
Yes?
Oh, okay.
Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
Toby...
Actually��� You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I���ll take one too.
It did, it did.
[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
Yeah!
...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.
With the crotch.
What's your win rate?
Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
Yeah, you said...
And flexible.
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
Yeah?
So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
Monkey. [kisses her]
[at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
Where we going?
No.
Go ahead, you do it.
Calves. Calves all the way.
Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
Eh, I've been sitting all day.
Screwgun. The sales call!
You know me.
Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
Fence with a hole in it..
Ok, what are they?
Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant
He does? What does he say.
[finds shoe box] Ooh.
Yes!
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
No, it's an accountability booster.
[over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
But as Jim and I discovered...  No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
She loves me.
Quiet you.
Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
No.
You seem suprised.
That place doesn���t exist. It���s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Speaking of pimples, let���s release the BLOGGERS!
He is.
To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
So, you can tell your clients: ���Unleash the power of the pyramid.���
[scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch]
Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
I am not a liar.
I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let���s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let���s go.
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
Michael, it's Phyllis.
[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]
I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.
It means like this. [snaps fingers]
[to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
[lifting box] Ugh! Ow.
Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
A bazooka. You remembered.
I'm gonna take you home Michael.
[yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
[taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It���s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I���d be happy to see Jim as manager.
You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I���ll do mine���.. walnuts?
No, like you.
I'm just saying...
Oh, man!
Oh my god.
That's not good.
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
You okay, Robert?
I can���t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
Hi, Mr. Bart.
Hey, it's not a surprise.
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?
[from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
Seventy-two hours.
You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
No! I don't want natural!
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
I don't ... have no idea.
I like where you're going with this. Continue.
Yeah.
Sensei, you���re not watching.
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?
Well, well, well, it���s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
Come on.
I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
Security deposit. That's been-
Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
You know what? You���re gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you���re going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
I'm gonna say 30.
Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]
Because you're engaged to Andy.
Your concern is noted.
Unless we're unplugged.
Yes, you do.
[digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?
Two to three hours...
When is the Paleolithic Age?
Welcome aboard.
Action.
Take a stand!
Aggggh, that stings!
I can't believe this news.  That--- wow.
Yeah.
Amazons.
Shhh.  Don't be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle]  ...oh no.
Got it?
This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
No, you're too close.
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
Same thing.
[turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
No.
Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]
It smells like chicken soup.
The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
Clown paint.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
Ok, good
Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it���s barely three pounds.
I���m trying, but what you���re asking is--
Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
But the little cars go in the compact spot
We will be called Gryffindor.
Jim, move!
All right, I'll take them.
[On Phone] One...
I throat-rip.
[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
You successfully backed down the mob!
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
It's a job interview, not a flea market.
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
Chicken fight!
Okay, I just...
So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?
I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]
What's the exact square footage.
It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
After you.
Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
Checks out.
I have a smudge on my forehead?
No.
[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Jan's here.
[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]
Pssht.
Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
It's a sales call.
That... that's impossible.
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
Should I get water or donuts?
Tell him, not Dwight.
Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
What the hell is this?
Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren���t going to look back.
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?
Whoa!
You're the stupid one.
And who had your office?
Where?
Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
You, you, you, you...
I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.
Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.
Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.
I've said too much.
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it���s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.
I love finding a good set of twins.
Yes, please.
Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
What?
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we���ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Hey guys.
...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
I am a person.
Louder! You���re shouting it from the back of a horse!
[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Oh God.
The waitress tripped on the cord.
[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
It could be kind of funny.
Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
Nice.
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Ghaaa!
Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it 'Hay Place'. Eldred Called it 'Hay World'. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.
[on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I...
Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
Okay. So yeah.
I'm being sabotaged.
No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha���You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
Not like this.
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
What are you doing?
You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
[coughs sentence] You're the idiot!
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
You guys should use a hand truck.
No.
Pam!
Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
Like the spirit of Christmas!
Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
Amazing.
It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
350 and one penny.
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let���s go!
You need-
Oh, we do. So we���ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
Because we're friends.
Ahh!
[stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]
I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
Which is you' is not a sentence.
[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Smart baby. That���s the most flavorful bond.
Ok, I get it.
Well, this is it.
Wait. Are you saying...
Jim!
Yeah!  Your idea.
Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.
Like in a cup?
This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
Come on!
Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.
Don't make me do this the hard way.
Michael is gone.
You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ���poisoned��� by Aunt Shirley.
Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor���s had stolen from him?
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him!
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
No? Then you are an idiot.
That suit is amazing.
It's non-transferable...
Oh that���s real creative.
[kicks the car] Unh! Scratch.
Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
What? Why would you say that���
Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
Busy!
Uh, bumper's sagging.
Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
Pam...
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
What are you doing?
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?
We'll be here waiting for you.
Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
How could it be more clear?
Are you laughing at me?
I just don't get it.
You���re really going to want the booster.
All we can do is sit and wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
It's all right. It's all right.
No women or children. Unless provoked.
I can get you exotic meats ��� hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
The perfect girl for me would be Konikotaka. She has the most amazing story. She was orphaned at age 10 when both her parents were assassinated, and she was taken in by a wealthy, but very cruel, businessman. So she practiced aikido in secret for years until she could avenge the death of her parents. She's also a survivor of monster rape.
It's a good market. Higher volume.
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
Damn it! Jim!
What branch?
Michael...
Yep. He'll be fine.
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
Quiet, you.
Seal it off.
No way.
No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
[laughs] I think you know.
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
Yes!
Yes.
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
Any specific animal?
Look, we're twins.
Oh, no. Oh, no!
Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
Ryan.  Come on, man?
Of course I checked it.
All you have to do it say it.
What did you do to it?
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Hey, how's it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
Were you absent?
Hope to see you soon.
Go. Push!
Next suggestion.
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
From the downsizing.
Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
Oh, huggy hugs.
That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]
Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
Get out of Jim���s seat.
You've done more then you can possibly know.
Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] ���Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.���
How convenient.
So tell me.
You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
Well, yeah.
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
Okay. Let's go. Step up.
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
Where are they?
Yeah pretty much.
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
You're lying. We didn't win.
Feast on this, Lewis.
Where you come from, and who you are.
Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.
I can���t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I���ll be launched into space. God, you���re so insensitive.
[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
No need we can just check the security tapes.
[cries harder] Thank you, Michael.
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
So you'll be reporting to me, then.
Don't do it, Michael.
[scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
Good. Really really good.
I will stay here and run things on this end.
No. I���ll be damned if I���m gonna let us lose me.
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.
Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I���m gonna like it.
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!
Thank you.
Can I talk to you about something?
This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
Really?
[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
Hey, monkey, how you doing?
I'm not closing the door.
Watch your step.
You most certainly did not.
I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
[Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
Pretty good.
Blah.
Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
Pam, hello.
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
I'm serious. What did you do to it?
Oh, please.
[shuts door on him] Great.
Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
That's not true.
Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
Shut up.
Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
How many in your party?
Correct.
I have an old barn!
Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
Come on pretty boy.
I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
Hope - grows.
Yes ma'am.
You said that?
Just act natural. [grunts]
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
[scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet]
$30,000? There's gotta be another way.
I know.
Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
Oh my God.
Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.
[looking into his coffee mug] What the hell?
Did you do her?
Are you kidding me?
Assistant team manager?
Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Perhaps.
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh��� No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.
[taking pen back] Gimme that.
Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
Okay, okay.
Meet my eye line, Jim!
[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.
Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
[lifts cup up with toes]
[scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
My hip bone!
KGB.
Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Okay. What'd you get?
[reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.'
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it���s an idea. But what does it mean?
Good morning Michael.
I was right.
Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
[to Erin] How are the marks?
No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
That is correct.
What if he's a murderer?
A quilt.  Depression quilt?
I don't think so.
Oh, I like it.
Right.
Mmm.  [nods]
Ryan.
C���mon.
It's too small.
I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane���s coming.  I suppose you���re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-
For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
Uh-huh.
Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that���s what working at a paper company���s all about!
Yes. And my decision in final.
Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
Michael, I would like to be the elf.
Oh, God!
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
It���s a root you idiot.
I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.
Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
Well, they can���t all be winners. But Trevor���s next and he���s a real professional. You say, ���Jump,��� and he says, ���Oh who?��� He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
D-W-I-G-H-T.
[yawns, ���Idiot��� is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
[grunts] Let���s take him���
Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
Gentlemen.
I knew it.
Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
Leave the keys!
I love you!
So can we come in?
Where did you get that mallard?
Do you have batteries?
And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Oh no, it's broken.
You did this, didn't you?
Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.
It���s him! Do something! Get out!
I can make him talk, Michael.
Let me get that door for you--  [runs to open door]
Troy, do you know anything about this?
Butter. Newborns are slippery.
So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
Yeah, maybe I���ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it���s the most pleasant I���ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
Take me to his house.
That's exactly what I said.
So, I'm paying full price?
No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]
Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
[excitedly] 'Ok' I can run it?
Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]
I don't think she'd be missed.
Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
Different guy.
[slams cell phone on desk] Argh! Ahh!!
[Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
Like those?
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.
Do you know how to use it?
And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
Office Depot!
Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
Kelly is disqualified!
Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
Well rested.
Okay.
...before noon...
[begins playing recorder]
You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.
In which direction?
I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
Mm-hmm.
They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?
Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
Yes.
I want Michael to take me...
Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Vamping.
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
Can you give me a second, sir.
Which is?
All right.
Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
That was the sick one, right?
Well, saddles��� [clicks tongue, whinnies] ��� sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam���s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn���t see it, or didn���t wanna see it.
Warf.
Crap.
I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
That doesn't make any sense.
Not a word.
It was his birthday, just turned three. So���
I'll try and think of one. When...
Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
Thank you Angela.
Where?
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
You know how I feel about IHOP.
100%.
Yeah.
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
Oh, they're forming an alliance
[throws ���now��� beanbag at Jim] Now.
You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
It is my duty...
What about Shoe La La?
Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...
[sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]
I can see the security guard's eyes.
I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
David. Can I just do one thing while you���re making this announcement and then I���ll never, ever do it again?
Never mind. Just never mind.
Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'
Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we���re about to do?
Come on.
Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
Lunch.
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
Hello.
Before taxes.
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.
I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
[tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
Stanley, could you come with me, please.
[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
Cause I could look it up real easily.
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
Classy.
Ow! God!
So you���ll do it?
Give me the hose!
No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
We?'
[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
That's where they remove the uterus.
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.
Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
Pshh. That's a bedbug.
Before I go, may I?
You're so immature!
Ed was decapitated.
Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
Hey.
Oh, how did that happen?
Jim!
Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
Admit it. Admit it.
Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
That's not going to happen.
I can't do this.
[changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
I'm not-- I'm not following you.
Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
[sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.
Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
How would you do that?
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Not you, Erin.
Cri-Man-Squa?
[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!
It means they are not expanding.
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
What?
[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
[whispers to Clark] We don���t get along.
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
[still typing] He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
Oh, worker's comp, my ass!
Okay, Jim.
Jim, don't interfere.
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
You work on commission, don't you?
OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.
You���ll always have the upper hand, when you���ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
That���s very true. Get the hell outta here.
One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]
Eel fishing.
At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
Don't you want a sheath for that?
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
You wanna eat, don't you?
We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]
Whassup!
Just run! Take the stairs!
Kathy.
Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
(takes out bag) 40. Always.
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you���re ever in the area, you���ll always have a place to stay���in my barn.
I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
[sighs] Sixty - forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I'll drive.
Good! Okay. Flirt away.
Did you see the board?
You're the best.
No, don���t say it. You���re fired! You���re both fired!
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
[shouts from another room] What did you do?
Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.
I will trade you for the used candle.
Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.
What are you doing? Those are my keys.
Walkie-talkies.
Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Good night.
Yes?
Oh, this could be a juicy one.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?
What is it?
Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
Eight?
I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
Where are gay mens��� vaginas?
Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he���s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
Shotgun!
You'll have Pam to answer to.
Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?
Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
How about 5:15?
Probably. [walks away with beans]
I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
Thank you.
Yeah!
Good.
Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
Okay.
Yes..?
I'm talking about... hmmm.
Alright. First thing in the morning then.
All right.
It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
Okay, get out of here.
A little eye for an eye action.
Up here. [whistles]
Looks serious.
Yes.
You don���t need to repeat right now, when I���m saying it.
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
Oh my gosh.
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
Let's go.
I'm not.
You���re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we���ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]
Kevin, not now.
Okay.
[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
See ya later, Trevor.
That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
[to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
Oscar.
Please Ja, Ja... [Jan hangs up]
Let's table that. So, temp... You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar.
Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
I'm only going to ask you this once. Are you part of an alliance?
Huh?!
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
He���s like a manatee. Ready? Let���s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley���s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.�� No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
I missed you Kevin.
Forget it. I'll look it up myself.
[puts his grandmother���s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
Absolutely, I do. [giggles]
I do that myself now.
That's a conflict of interest.
Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]
In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
No.
And she is your boss.
[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
I need help.
No... way! Yeah!
No, you���ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who.
Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
Yeah, you don���t want Italian. You���ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you���ll be doing life in Rikers Island.
Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
None of your business. I'm writing something.
[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
Michael.
Oh. Okay. Fine. Well done.
Yes. I am.
Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list]
Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
Damn it!
What?
Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
[Jo leaves] I, uh...
Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]
If you want.
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
Big day for you.
Okay, just shut it.
What did you say?
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk]
So excited.
[employees chuckle] And he
Sorry.
It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You���re still at the 570 number?
Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]
Oh, hey, I���ll take a coffee.
Don't do anything rash!
Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
I'll make you two tapes.
$100 a day, plus expenses.
What���s a book? [giggles]
Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn���t seem so macho now, does it? It���s a jump rope!
Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
[tearful laugh]. Get out of my way.
I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her]
Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]
What's with the smile?
Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!
[clears throat] Knock, knock.
Eat it!
I...
I would make sure that you were dead.
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
Are those real pearls?
Hallowed ground.
Also, he slept with Pam.
Have you seen it?
No, you���re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ��L--
Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I���m eating Jims.
I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.
You can't tantalize me.
...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
I do not look worried.
Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair]
Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
Come on, shooter!
The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
Listen up.  Let's start... from the ground
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You���re gonna watch me right?
Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.
[on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Hey... Why did you do it?
In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
[salutes] Thank you, Michael.
[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
[putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
Fire Jim.
Oh, man!
Yes, Sensei!
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
[takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Blood, urine, or semen.
[picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
Yes.
Hello.
Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
I have to go to the hospital.
It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
Come down right away!
Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
I will never, ever let you down.
Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
That's a realistic time line.
Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go!
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
She said she was only sleeping with me.
Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
[phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he���s free anytime. Not a problem.
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl]
Yes!
Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
Good, we have a deal?
Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
I told you.
Try Dwight.
Right?
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
Yow!
Basement office? You mean like a lair?
[talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
[agreeing with Shirley] Thank you.
Toby...
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
I'll have Pam send out a memo.
There were only two options.
My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
I'm sorry, Michael
Oh he's not that nice.
We'll see.
Way to go man, Jan's really hot.'
Yes... [whispers] I miss you.
What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face]
That's bad.
Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.
[straightens Andy's tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
[looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this.
Watch this part, okay?
[sighs]
What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three 'M's. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.
just drink a lot of water.
Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
Like who?  Who doesn't know?
Attention blue collar workers!
I got sofa. I got sofa.
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
I'm gonna save you!
People who don't trust egg whites.
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.
Okay, that is
Hello? Hello?
Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo!
And she called it nuts?
Wow! Lot of calories.
Why do they call him The Bus?
[plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
MR. RYAN HOWARD!
Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
Michael.
Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
That is a demerit.
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
Hey, hey!
Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we���ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War���
Who is he saying?
Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.
What does it look like?
No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
It's only twenty-five bucks.
Michael, wait. Let me go.
Now, Jim!
How do I look?
Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
You need to do something about your B.O.
No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
Yeah.
Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that...
What box?!
No. And the sheets are made of fire.
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp.
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?
Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room]
Ha!
[smiles] That's two things.
We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
You dressed exactly like the servants.
Why? I don't understand.
Yep.
I will. I will. You need to calm down.
Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
Me.
Where?
Why Jim?
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.
Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
What's jazz hands?
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
[throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
Game on!
Accept it, why would he come back?
[handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
[has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
Well something's come up, I have to go.
Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
Really?
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
Thank you.
Ow.
Sheriff Pierce? I'm turning in my badge.
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
Yes, it is. Carry on.
This is Dunder Mifflin...
Next suggestion.
Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder.
Let's get the party started.
Crisis averted.
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
[lays on bed] Really?  I hadn't noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
That's great.
Go ahead. Don't lie.
Oh, you're kidding me!
Yes.
It's not the greatest one either...
Some sort of virus?
Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
I knew you would, Nancy.
Dwight...
Hello.
So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Try influenza.
Oh, thank you.
Ow.
[Dwight groans] Ugh.
OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
Oh, no. What's wrong?
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
Words will never be enough.
A loyal, but bungling apostle.
[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
Next to me?
Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV.'
Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.
[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
Good luck, Michael.
What?
He's not a songbird.
Ah damn pop-ups.
[referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!
He's lying.
Pam, please call security!
You think Jim���s lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.
A net? a giant net?
Goodbye.
Yeah, you know me.
Oh God.  Oh God.
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
That's my stopwatch.
Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound]
Jim. Look I���m eating you.
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
Hey, hey. Easy.
You're thinking of a chicken.
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
What else does it look like?
has brought...
Yes you can.
Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.
Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
Ok, I'll punch you.
[opens eyes wide in total surprise]
[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
Where did you see it?
No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
What can I do better?
Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
You���re telling me!
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
Might get ugly.
Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
Die. You just... You said it.
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.
Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley���s got way more body fat than they do.
That's a very good record.
Yeah.
What? Come on.
Oh, man.
Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
Oh my God, she told you?
No, you will be tested.
This is not a test! Move to the exits!
Why just Michael?
Hey, what are you laughing at?
So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
[sighs] You're an idiot.
The planet Caprica.
Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.
No.
[Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile���nod. Smile and nod.
But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job.  Interested?
And circle gets the square.
Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim���s desk while he���s away in Philly. Finally I���ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It���s like, ���Really, Jim? You don���t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.��� Wow.
Yeah, but no one here has it.
Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
Did you get your tickets?
[sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back!
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Great.
Try again��� Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one��� is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
Ugh. I'm hanging up.
[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!
Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
What?
Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
Is that how they like to get in?
MIS... MI... What are you doing?
Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ���Scranton Mimeograph Corp?��� I don���t think we���re doing business with them any time soon. That���s odd. ��A letter from Robert Dunder. ���A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.��� The Holy Grail.
Thank God.
Aye aye, Captain.
Let me see.
Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
[lying on Michael's desk] Hold me!
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't...
Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.
[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let���s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man���s closet.
...Okay.
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
...so good.
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
Come on!
[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
Hey... what are you guys doing?
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan���s costume and check out his notes.
[sighing]
No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
You really want Packer as your boss?
Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
What's that?
Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.
Let's go.
[running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
Welcome to the club, pig! [laughs]
Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that���s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
It goes out automatically at five P.M.
Good morning, Michael.
You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.
Uh, duh.
Ryan? What does he know?
Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You���re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark���s shoulder]
Jim couldn���t land me in a thousand years.
Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Dumatril.
[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Right here.
I need you to perform a test.
[panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.
Okay?
Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
No trades.
[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
They match the carpet
[clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.
Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He���s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I���ve got big expectations, Mose-wise.
They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
Do you own a gun?
Oh my���! Oh d���! Oh, how did���? [gasps] Huhhhhh!
[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
No. Angela! What are you saying?
Don't.
Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.
Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]
GAH!!!
Not the living in fear, that's new.
Let me see your ID.
Who cares.
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
I was born a man, Halpert.
Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?
I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
I
Yes you did.
I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?
First present, Oscar.
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
It's time.
I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
Oh my gosh, now she's up.
You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person���s penis?
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on]
What is?
Who are you calling?
Hmmm?
Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.
[Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying.  When my workers-gather-
This is smaller than your old place.
[looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
C���mon.
That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
Who is the king of Austria?
So long Donna! [Michael hangs up]
[attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah!
But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
No, you know what? You do it.
Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
Christmas card list.
What?
Okay. But it���s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can���t scrub worth a damn.
Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.
Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
He doesn't even know that I do that.
I chose my words very carefully.
No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
Inbwit? Yes.
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
Yes.
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-
Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?
Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
No doy!
How close?
No.
Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the 'trappings' of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Oh. Terrible idea.
Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]
[box falls over] Oh.
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
That is not a statue, that is a robot.
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
It's not effeminate. It's festive.
Michael.
Excuse me, Goldschlager, extra flakes.
Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
I think it was Creed.
What are you doing?
How much longer is this going to take?
Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders.
Oh, I bet you think it���s all about core, huh?
Observe. [walks towards desk]
Are there any bloggers around?
No, there's no blood.
We don't take debit cards, anyway.
Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?
It is my idea.
None of your business, Jim.
[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
Michael, you know I can't take this.
All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
Seven...
I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
Come on.
Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].
Yes.
Word.
Aah!
[wraps tape around Stanley���s body]
Jim, Michael's office.
Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
He's not kidding.
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
No, okay.
Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
Yeah.
Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out.
Not counting the last one, 25.
[laughs hysterically] I got her!
Thank you. I���m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
Aah! Actually, he���s right in front of us.
Yes.
Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
K, I���m gonna need some help. Pam?
Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
Just rock. Shh.
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
Go back to the monkey!
Yes.
Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Yes! We advance to the next round!
It's small, I know.
I demand more questions!
Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!
No. Why not do it now?
That's it.
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Jack Nicholas.
[typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don���t see the point. It���s so Wall Street.
Return it!  Return it now!
[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.
Oh really?
He defecated, aw.
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
Yeah, Andy.
We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa.
But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
Ten.
I didn't say anything
Hey Santa!
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
Oh... no... really?
Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
Fine.  Good.
Where is Ryan?
You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
Yes!
Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
And I was thinking it���s only fair that you help make this decision since they���ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you���re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
Ready?
No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
Her name?
Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
[picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
Is that the last year the data was available?
You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
That's impossible.
Why didn't I go to business school?
No, Michael!
About what?
I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']
I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.
[low] Oh God, here.
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
Can you breathe?
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
It was Andy's idea.
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
[again] Assistant Regional Manager.
Yes! Ha!
Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]
Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
You don't want to know.
No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
She sent an email, so.
[eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela's candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm.
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!
Hmm?
In the ocean.
What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?
Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]
Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.
Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
Wing.
Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn���t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
No you do not.
[incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.
No. You will not.
Yeah!
I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
We're not allowed to use the baler.
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
That's fair.
I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
No, not me.
You're insane.
Hello.
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
No, but that's sometimes part of it.
Made copies of it-
No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]
Dale Raymond Corson!
Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself.
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
Burgers.
[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]
Five, four, three, two...
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
These covers are totally indestructible.
When I was asking about the leads.
I've had intercourse in the office.
It's not fair.
[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
Alright.
I'm gonna with the python.
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
I will poison your food.
Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That���s not true.  Just give me another chance.
Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.' Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
She was stoned apparently.
I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
[gasps]Wait, the numbers!
Stanley! Wake up! You���ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
[picks up his beeping cell phone]
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
Wow.
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
Really?  'Cause Ryan says so?
Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
There���s plenty. Don���t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Apparently.
Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
What?
Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.
Ok.
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
Oh, that's funny.  MICHAEL!
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
No, no. Give me the steam.
Keep them.
I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'  Those are the money beets.
And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
They might be listening to us
Thank you.
That laugh is so infectious.
He looks like your twin.
Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ���please kitty, may I have some more?��� You can���t make this stuff up!
[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
No, it was not!
Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
[on the phone] I understand.
You promised us whales. These are worms.
Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
Hey.
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
No, hmmm... that's still...
Tokyo?
Not good.
What are you looking at?
Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?
That snake!
PETA.
If I were you...
[long pause] Crentist.
This is not a test! Can you leave?!
Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
And anoth���
Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]��� Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
Who are you talking to?
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
[picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall]
Okay��� Seven, one, one, nine���
I sa- [Andy honks his horn]
[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?
Well, the alert was already set to ���Red��� because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ���Double Red���?
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Yes, exactly!
It's complicated.
Andy, I can't hear this right now.
All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J���rg Ro���kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!
...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's]
Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
This is war and that is what happens.
Come on.
So what do you need me to do?
Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]
Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
No, I can't... I ca...
It is warm feelings.
Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
Kevin! Doesn't apply.
Think it through.
Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
On a boat.
No, it's marijuana.
Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts?
Dwight Schrute.
I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
I insist.
Pow! Pow! Pow!
But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.
Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
[hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
I can see that happening, yes.
Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
Please, don't.
Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
And you didn���t call Jim - that seems significant.
I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file]
Can I be your representative?
Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.
Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
You can't possibly be serious.
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?
You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
[walking up] Michael?
Jethro Tull...
But we were gonna break the pig rib.
I know...
Unbelievable.
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
I'm not cr-- uhh!
Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
Define scorched earth policy.
Really?
Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
Yes? What is the meaning of this?
Pam.
She���s got a ton of great qualities. She���s young, she���s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we���re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn���t technically incest.
Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
He wouldn't listen to me
PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
[fires tranquilizer gun at Stanley]
Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
[to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]
My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]
My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!
Hey, Jan.
Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
Yes, of course it does.
[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]
[Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans]
Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing ��� bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You���re gonna love ���em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world���s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]
Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]
Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now?  It's not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.
I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
Hey! It's on the list, everybody.
Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
I���m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
[coughing] It's still stinky.
Where are you taking the client list?
We measured it once...
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
[whispering] Michael.
You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?
Not yet.
Yes.
Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
Why him?
I was just jogging.
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Thanks, girl.
I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
I would remember.
Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?
Yeah...
Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could���ve met in the lobby. It���s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
I most certainly did not.
Wow. Did your baby draw that?
Jackpot.
What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who���s the father of her child?
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
Come along, afterthought.
All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]
Not now!
Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
[boastfully] Yes.
Right.
That's what she said! [David laughs]
[eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
Really? Oh... Then here we are.
Yes.
No. No.
A few of the ground rules?
[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
Does it have a deck?
[frightened] Uh!
[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
Yep.
I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
[sobbing] Thank you.
Nothing.
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
No the other thing.
But you still work for Wired, right?
Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
Your path from obesity begins right here!
Yes.
OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
No! [lunges for a large wooden spool]
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
Do you know what 'snap decision' means?
Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
(Bleep)
Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
But you can say that about anything.
You'll see. Here we go.
Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
Master bee.
...is really tight.
What is that?
Put some ice on it.
Damn you.
Dripping on me.
No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
Psst.
No no no.
Eh, its not that early.
