Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you���re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
[singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
[eating Tootsie Rolls from Angela's candy on her desk] Mmm. Good. Mmm.
Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
[Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
Yeah, right. I���m afraid that ship has sailed.
Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now?  It's not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
[looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face.
Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'IT WAS DWIGHT' written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]
So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they���re protecting America���s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day���s security codes. Something that���s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It���s not the KGB, but it���s a start.
I will trade you for the used candle.
Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.
Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I���m telling you... if you don���t do this, [whispers] I don���t stand a chance. Please, Jim.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you���ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ���Infuriating, irresponsible���...
[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
[hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?
I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Oh no, I���m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it���s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
I am so sorry.  I'm so sorry, sir.
[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.
Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.
I���m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We���ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
[moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention]
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!
[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.
And you want me to come with you.
[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
Look.  She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She's a bumpkin.  Pass.
Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance.
I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he���s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
[running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
In a way it���s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they���ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I���ll have a grandson.
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
[Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]
Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk]
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl]
Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late.
[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.
Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?
I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
The perfect girl for me would be Konikotaka. She has the most amazing story. She was orphaned at age 10 when both her parents were assassinated, and she was taken in by a wealthy, but very cruel, businessman. So she practiced aikido in secret for years until she could avenge the death of her parents. She's also a survivor of monster rape.
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don���t see them so I think we���re good.
Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is���for���Kevin.
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices]
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
[to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder.
You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn���t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
Hello, spoiled little baby, [to a watermelon] in your fancy brand name stroller.  Mmm, I wonder if it's as safe as they say it is.  Oh, look, a curb.  Uh oh, let's see what happens... [lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.  My parents left me beside the road.  I crawled home.
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.
Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor]
Oh, no, no, no. It���s good. It���s really -- on the Internet, it���s a really -- that���s a really good, good, thing.
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!
I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
Clark has no chance. I mean, he���s up against my buddy Rolf, for God���s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ��� he���ll make you laugh so hard, you���ll puke your pants.
Wow, that���s great. That���s great. Ok, good, let���s talk about that, ok?
Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.
Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
[plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?
Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]
I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I���ll do mine���.. walnuts?
Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, maybe I���ll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it���s the most pleasant I���ve ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: There���s a madman in our midst.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.
Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.
No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ���Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.��� [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts]
Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
[grunts] Okay, we���re good. We���re good. Let���s go. Push!
[puts his grandmother���s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?
Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it���s your call.
Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!
We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
And they said it couldn���t be done. Boom!
Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
Cause I could look it up real easily.
Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
I don't want people making fun of my nose.
Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet]
Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?
Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief]
Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Oh, no it's not. Okay, check it out.
Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
Could be a bat weevil��� Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
You had to, what other choice did you have?
[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?
Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it���s barely three pounds.
Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
I wish I could hire all of you.
For five years I���ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it���s time for me to just let that thought go. It���s kind of painful, but it���s also freeing in a way. Now it���s all about my instincts.
[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
[cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?
Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
[picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
I do not respect her, but I will go.
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
[continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That���s it? Oh, that���s great. That���s like a five second delay.
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
[Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
[turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]
No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?
Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
[clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.
Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end.
[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.
Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.
What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous.
Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim���s desk while he���s away in Philly. Finally I���ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It���s like, ���Really, Jim? You don���t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.��� Wow.
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
[answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other���s minds. You���re trying to give your wife this job.
Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]
Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
You think Jim���s lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.
I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.
Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
I will stay here and run things on this end.
Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
Okay, listen. I���m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I���ve never actually done this before.
It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
[walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]
Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot.
It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
Prestige is ours. Okay, they���re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?
[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.
Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.
Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]
...because you are never going to see him again.
Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I���m back.
Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
Yeah, you don���t want Italian. You���ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you���ll be doing life in Rikers Island.
I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder]
It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
Gotcha! Yeah! Let���s see ya get out of this web, huh?
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?
Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?
I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
But this isn���t interim manager. No. It���s Dwight K. Schrute��� [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.
Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?
Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I'll install it on your computer.
So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that���s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
[drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!
You seem a little nervous. You shouldn't be.
If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.
Oh, we do. So we���ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
[sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
I can see that as a very real possibility.
I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.'
NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
All we can do is sit and wait.
Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
Well, well, well, it���s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you���re in a suicide cult.
Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier���s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don���t even care about nationals.
I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
���But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark���s getting out of my car. He���s a good boy, does whatever I say.
Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]
Oh God... ��Hey no! Where do you think you���re going? You���ve gotta stay for the big presentation we���ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He���s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]
They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
The eyes are the groin of the head.
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.
Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]
I have to do something to his eyes.
A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.'
Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
It's a job interview, not a flea market.
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger���s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
The buyer is your sister���s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that���s an order.
Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]
There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing ��� bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You���re gonna love ���em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world���s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
Maybe over a beer after she���s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
Well, the alert was already set to ���Red��� because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ���Double Red���?
I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV.'
I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']
There's so much more to it than that.
Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.
Oh, I���m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I���m not in your panties, I don���t go vigilantes. Why don���t you ask your husband?
Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It���s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he���s slouching. Okay, can you���sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager���s office before?
No, no, don't, don't tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
[scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch]
That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!
Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
[lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
Then I would bring an axe, no books.
Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-
Stanley! Wake up! You���ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They���re a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We���d go in pretending to be family ��� brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store.  Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
And he made us all look like chumps!
Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.
Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.
Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.
Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Here���s how I���m going to help out from now on. I���m going to not care, and I���m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy���s inevitable demise.
Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.
There���s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]
[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
Open the gates! There���s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There���s plenty for everyone!
Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You���re still at the 570 number?
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.
Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?
What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.
[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.
So why is this on your resume? [door slams]
Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
What kind of mileage does this baby get?
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]
Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]
Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.
That���s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don���t vibrate at all.
To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
[as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.
I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it���s an idea. But what does it mean?
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]
But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You'll be back.
[interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]
Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
It���s a colloquial way of saying ���you���re fired,��� Kevin, which you are.
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what���s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you���re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back.
Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who.
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we���re about to do?
[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.
I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then.'
I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan]
No, but we should discuss that another time.
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]
Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk]
Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I���ve ever made.
You've done more then you can possibly know.
No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley���s got way more body fat than they do.
[sighs] Sixty - forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I'll drive.
We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.
I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]
[kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
[angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ��� What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
But we were gonna break the pig rib.
What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]
Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car.
Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
[Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, 'Kind of.'
What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it 'Hay Place'. Eldred Called it 'Hay World'. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.
Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
She���s got a ton of great qualities. She���s young, she���s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we���re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn���t technically incest.
No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]
These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He���s gonna be moving slowly. It���s only���
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
How long has he been in the bathroom?
Don't make me do this the hard way.
OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]
Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...
Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.
It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]
Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.
I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
I'm only going to ask you this once. Are you part of an alliance?
Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
That���s very true. Get the hell outta here.
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]
Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?
It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
Let���s go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!
[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
Wha ��� what is this supposed to be?
We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]
What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]
Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won���t be necessary tonight.
Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.
[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
[sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
Don���t be an idiot. It���s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you���ve been here. That���s the max.
[takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
[looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
Now, for the last time, I���d like a side salad with balsamic.
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
[playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
How much longer is this going to take?
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.
[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.
I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don���t try planking. It���s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ���Specially with me around.
You did. Several times. Over and over again.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.
Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'
What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.
[Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it's handle] You sell a lot of these?
Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
[bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
And I was thinking it���s only fair that you help make this decision since they���ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
No. Putting a load on more like it.
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
There���s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They���ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ���em on in there.
True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]
Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
Wait, I see you every day. Can I say 'Good month?'
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now.  She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package]
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.
As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert���s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
It would be better if you were unconscious.
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]
Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
[off screen] What are you guys talking about?
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
He went over your head to go behind your back.
No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!
Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?
Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
Oh, man, never thought I���d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
No, don���t say it. You���re fired! You���re both fired!
Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]
He said he would do the same for me.
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.
Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.
Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
Oh, I'm OK.  I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
Very well, we will come back at 5:15.
Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
What are some of your small business ideas?
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Hey. Come on, buddy. Let���s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don���t compare. When you���re with the R-O-L-F, you���re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM!  Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM! [pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put
Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.
Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three 'M's. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.
Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
[walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry.
[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...
[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
[answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
Actually��� You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I���ll take one too.
Oh, you think they���re my only friends? I���ve got way more friends than that, and they���re all better than the losers who work here.
[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan���s costume and check out his notes.
Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!
[Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
You know, you���re right! We hadn���t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]
Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review.
[on the phone] ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber.
They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]
Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing 'Centerfold.'] They might be listening to us.
Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.' Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.
Thank you. I mean, I���ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh���
Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves]
Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.
Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
I���m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where���s Stanley?
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
[places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
[holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file]  'Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.' Juvie. 'According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor...'  Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]
Okay. But it���s cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can���t scrub worth a damn.
I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
You can't steal what is legally your property.
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
���Higher than numbers go.��� The ceiling above accounting!
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
I don't get that, I don't understand that.
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.
Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
Jeez! What���s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]
I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
[off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?
Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don���t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning 'Love,' and adelph, meaning 'Adolf.' 'the city that loves Adolf.' Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
[on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.
[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
Really? That���s interesting. ���Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who���s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard.
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet���.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]
I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]
It can���t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here.
Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie���?  Lick the spoon?
[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
[phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he���s free anytime. Not a problem.
Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.
[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?
Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
I���d like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]
OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
No need we can just check the security tapes.
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]
No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
[picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'
We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]
Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.
You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I���ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I���ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I���m doin��� great.
Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
Are you really not going to punch him?
[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!
Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
Do you want to do this right or not?
Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.
You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.
Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
In your office? [in Michael's office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
[yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
[sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.
No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.
We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.
Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you���re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
Where you come from, and who you are.
No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]
I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
[waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael's office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this?  Jan?
Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ���em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis]   You want half a sandwich?
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here���s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.
Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]
No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
[looks over and sees hole in his present]  Crap.  [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up]  Come here you.
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick]
[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.
I would make sure that you were dead.
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
[bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.
David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
We are going to have two men's rooms.
Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
[yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you���re ever in the area, you���ll always have a place to stay���in my barn.
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.
[Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ���The Grass Roots��� in the 1960���s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
Maybe if you listened a little bit, you���d improve. No wonder women despise you.
[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand]
Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]
I have to have an emergency crown put in.
I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
[interrupting] ��� lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
[trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's 'Let's Get Physical' starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]
[Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying.  When my workers-gather-
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.
[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]
So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good.
That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
Mmm. That���s a good��� question. 300 times��� [Jim hangs up] 180��� Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Why would I put a banana in my holster?
Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
Ha ha! Yeah, joke���s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
The target-- it���s Oscar, isn���t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'  Those are the money beets.
De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]
She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
I���d have to get some more wire and string, but it���s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.
I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. [turns Ryan around annd points to basketball players] You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Iris, thank you so much for having me.
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.
Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.
[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?
[singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]
My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?
[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
Daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare���s milk?
Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]
Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
[quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]
May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]
[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]
Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
And I���ve never seen you go to work, ever.
Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
[scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.
Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
You think I don���t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I���ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne���er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don���t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!
So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
There���s plenty. Don���t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]
You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.
I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]��� Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
[takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!
[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could���ve met in the lobby. It���s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.
I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!
[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby]
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
[eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I���m sure he���d give a reference.
Well, I���ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.
Well, saddles��� [clicks tongue, whinnies] ��� sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
This conversation has two items on the agenda.
But as Jim and I discovered...  No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]
I started a fire with my cheese pita.
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ���ahhmmm��� excuse me��� What?! Not now, I'm busy.
Guys, it wasn���t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn���t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
I know. That���s not why I���m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]
Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
You know where it is. Lead me there.
When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
What makes you think you���d be an effective paper salesman?
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]
See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!
I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.
Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I���ll be right back.
Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
How do I become a manger at Sabre?
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
You are clean. Okay��� One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who���s the father of her child?
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
[scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
So what kind of commissions you get up there?
I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn���t seem so macho now, does it? It���s a jump rope!
Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
Andy is complicating things.  But I'm not worried.  This will only up my game.
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
Yes. Fast food. I���ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not?
And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.
I think I cut my penis on the lid!
Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.
Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that���s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.
It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
Pfft, ���Athlead���? Please. They���re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ���Stumpany,��� for ���Stupid Company.���
[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]
Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
[snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.
No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]
Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
[in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
Let���s just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice]
[to group] OK, let���s look at some ties.
Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I���ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]
I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.
Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]
Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.
[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]
There's no gum. There never was any gum.
Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
It���s just one thing. Just let me���let me do this���
Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
[on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that's my name.  See you soon.
That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
Well something's come up, I have to go.
Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.
[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
[stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.
The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We���re running late. Let���s get him inside.
Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
[putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face]
Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]
I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]
I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'
Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam's shoulders] You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
[throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
[turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]
I do not!  I do not say 'Hi' Pam!
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]
That is not a statue, that is a robot.
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...
It���s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we���re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Oh my���! Oh d���! Oh, how did���? [gasps] Huhhhhh!
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?
You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]
Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
I never said it was better than an iPod.
You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
Boo, unimpressed. It���s a tightrope for babies. Boo!
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.
God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
[out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
No, you���re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ��L--
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
[on phone with Jim] I hope you���ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it���s time for another episode of ���Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire���.
Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]
Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
Hi Daryl. I���m just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby.
I wanted to offer you a new position.
I gave her a higher clearance than you.
[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh���should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.
Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
Who was the second man on the moon?
Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...
Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute'
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
[heated discussion in the 'Dwight Schrute Workspace', door opens] I did not dismiss you.
Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]
You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't...
Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? [Pretends to be on phone] ���Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.��� It's that easy.
Oh, don���t lie. I���m trying to save those precious knees you���re always bragging about. ��Now, let���s get out of here. He could be right behind us.
Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.
Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.
Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
I know. I could just bang you right now.
[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.
No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]
I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!
It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
No. I���ll be damned if I���m gonna let us lose me.
I already made an appointment��� with your secretary.
You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
That���s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.
The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
I want to be here when you fire her ass.
Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear]
[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
He doesn't even know that I do that.
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.
It was nothing personal. It���s just that you were terrible at your job.
Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It���s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I���d be happy to see Jim as manager.
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
I'm serious. What did you do to it?
Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the 'trappings' of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.
[reading the note with the gay-dar]  'Hope this helps.  -Jim'  Nice!
So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]
Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
You���re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we���ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
From when he recommended me to replace him.
Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
This is not a test! Can you leave?!
I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
[lays on bed] Really?  I hadn't noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin]
[yawns, ���Idiot��� is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He���s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I���ve got big expectations, Mose-wise.
What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.
I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I���ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
Aah! Actually, he���s right in front of us.
I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.
Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]
There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
Why don't you just buy the whole song?
We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here���s something. Who would eat who in an ���Alive��� situation. No... that can���t be it.
Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
[while everyone is gathered playing and singing ���Sons & Daughters���] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.
I thought he was out on the road.
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like���not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor���
Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
I can try. I���m gonna use SMS text.
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
I���ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I���m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
Uh, no, no. No, I think something bad, maybe.
Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
No. Let him get his own. It���s Syracuse money.
Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
I need to go over some details with you.
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!
[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!
Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
Then looks like we have a deal��� Son [holds up a suit identical to his]
Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
[Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job.  Interested?
You just said it. You just said it.
Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp.
You need to do something about your B.O.
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.
OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
[sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn���t you say?
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]
No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes.
You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]
I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.
How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That's good. That's good.
Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
[has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.
Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
[looking into his coffee mug] What the hell?
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
You haven���t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let���s go over membership. I���m going to need the first month���s and the last month���s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month���
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]
Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]
Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.
I like where you're going with this. Continue.
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could���ve choked so many people by now.
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?
...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
I���m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
[singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check��� on that later today. This is my grandmother���s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother���s buttock bullet ring.
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it.
That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there���s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]
Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
If you say screw you one more time...
Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
Jim couldn���t land me in a thousand years.
Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
That���s really rude.  I don���t tell you hurricanes suck even though it���s true.
[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!
No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?
David. Can I just do one thing while you���re making this announcement and then I���ll never, ever do it again?
Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]
Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling]  Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
[changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.
[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?
Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
OK, can we steer away from gay people?
Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
My pants fell down! I don���t have a belt!
Okay, this isn���t working for me, ���cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.
[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]
It���s a youtube thing! Let���s go. Let���s go. Come on, they���re coming.
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?
You were making me do things that were not all right.
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They���re not for me. They���re for my cousin Mose. He���s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Okay, I���m a woman. [high voice] I���m a woman. Good?
Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]
Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?
Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
I can���t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]
Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
[scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
Well, it���s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
You���re the Quizno���s. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn���t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
That never happened. He���s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ���saving treats��� from the kitty litter box.
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.
The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
I could, but I just don���t feel like it loser.
Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
What quality would make you a good sales associate?
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers]
Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I���m gonna like it.
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
And you didn���t call Jim - that seems significant.
Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.
Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
[raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.
That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.
I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that.
Let's table that. So, temp... You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar.
Oh, come on. I���ve never heard of such a thing.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
Uh, if they don't bobble, what's the point?
Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
Oh, great. He���s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ���Scranton Mimeograph Corp?��� I don���t think we���re doing business with them any time soon. That���s odd. ��A letter from Robert Dunder. ���A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.��� The Holy Grail.
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
[Reading from computer] ���Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!��� That means you can't make me do squat.
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
I'm ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
I can tell. I won't let you down.
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?
I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
What the? [follows Nellie into the break room]
Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
[scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!
[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]
Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
Could I have a copy of one of them?
[to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.
[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...
Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ���
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow]
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
It���s 15 feet down, it���s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it���s like your catching a medicine���
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
[falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah!  Aa-aaah! [throws it ahead of the car, it goes for a while and then is stopping]  It's a hardy stroller. [takes watermelon out of stroller, holds it up to show camera] Maybe it's safe!
The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'
No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
What do you think I am saying to you?!
Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
I don���t like him either. ��And yet I really like him.
[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody's found the hog maw.
[at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side.
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
I love finding a good set of twins.
Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?
Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
[straightens Andy's tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
[from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!
The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam���s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn���t see it, or didn���t wanna see it.
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?
Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.
Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he���s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.
Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you���re so smart. You���re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
We did it, we did it. I love you.
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim's hand and leaves]
Well, we���re both just kinda learning as we go, aren���t we?
Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room]
[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I���m eating Jims.
So what do you need me to do?
I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?
Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don���t quit your day job.
Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ���I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt��� unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?
No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
You did not just say that! You don���t know Pam. She is really cool.
Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...
[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls.  We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
You had black hair and then gray hair.
It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
Michael, I would like to be the elf.
[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
No, it���s not. Here���s how we find out. Let���s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let���s just size each other up here and left side of the list��� ATTACK!
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Why would Michael give you one before me?
Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
[to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.
Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn���t on the itinerary.
You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
But the little cars go in the compact spot!
I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure.
I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession?
Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don���t see the point. It���s so Wall Street.
It is the situation that we are in now.
I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
[yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?
Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!
[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
That place doesn���t exist. It���s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
But you're engaged. Aren't you and maybe you've set a date for the wedding, hmm? And because you know you're going to get married you don't have to take our health care plan seriously.
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts?
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]
Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
And how big do you want this robot?
Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.
Excuse me, I got a question for you.
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]
Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.
These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.'
Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
Wha���Yes. Your attention. Uh because��� No that is all. [walks out]
I know that. Don't you think I know that?
No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long.
I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]
This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?
So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]
I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound.
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
I put everything back in the vending machine.
I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog. [runs with stroller]  Oh, no!  Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer [forcefully pushes stroller away toward uneven ground with junk strewn around, the stroller hits some junk, stays upright, and stops safely]
What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.
It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it���s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.
[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves]
[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.
Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.
Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
Louder! You���re shouting it from the back of a horse!
It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person���s penis?
Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]
So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
All their top clients I can't believe it.
[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, 'muffin basket.' Then I thought, 'What���s even more precious to people than muffins?'
Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound]
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her.
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's...
[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door]
Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don���t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So��� have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let���s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So���yes. I���d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane���s coming.  I suppose you���re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
Shhh, Pam. C���mon, don���t be such a right-sider.
Smasher? No, where���d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city���s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?
No, no, no, no! You don���t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There���s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don���t have diplomatic relations.
Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
No! No, Oscar. He���s a friend. He���s a friend.
Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.' You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.
OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Come up with a statement in the next hour....
So, you ever been convicted of a felony?
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]
[sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
Try again��� Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one��� is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
I want him to have all the urine he needs.
I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You���re gonna watch me right?
I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
Of course there���s a costume! [laughs] ��Oh, this is gonna be great. There���s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?
But the little cars go in the compact spot
All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J���rg Ro���kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please.
Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
You said you didn't know how to say it.
STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-
Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
She said she was only sleeping with me.
What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news���thing.
[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
We all have a hero in our heart.
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager���s job?
You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.
Well, they can���t all be winners. But Trevor���s next and he���s a real professional. You say, ���Jump,��� and he says, ���Oh who?��� He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.
Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha���You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
[referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!
[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
Hey, how's it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
Look, I have no problem with women. It���s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don���t lie about your shoulders!
Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
This is war and that is what happens.
OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I'm in pain.
I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
That is a damnable lie. I love women.
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
I can get you exotic meats ��� hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
You don���t need to repeat right now, when I���m saying it.
These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
Just slip it off my���Slip it off my hips.
Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and���
No. We can���t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]
Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ���please kitty, may I have some more?��� You can���t make this stuff up!
We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone]
Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh��� No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
It's about this very announcement you just made.
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]
Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.
Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
[stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]
Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren���t going to look back.
That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn���t even know it. I���ll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
You know there's a ghost in this office
I need to make a sales call.  Please?
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They���re extraordinary.
[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me.
Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on]
No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It���s called ���Schrute or Consequences.��� You���re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
So who will be your new Number Three?
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it���s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It���s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It���s for a disorder of the mind.
No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question: is there fire wood on the island?
Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.
Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.
Let me get that door for you--  [runs to open door]
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
[voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That���s right. You���re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
Well today���s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]
Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
That���s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.
That���s right. Will you just give us a second?
Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too 'meh' or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing 'I wear makeup'] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I���m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file]
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.
Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
Thank you. I���m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]
[shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-
[Holds his finger to Jim's lips] Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim]
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
I can���t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I'm really sorry... about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?
Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was ���poisoned��� by Aunt Shirley.
Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]
Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!
Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over.  I'm sorry.
Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before.
So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
[at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.
I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
[into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.
Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.
He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
That���s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
I'm about to buy this building, you know.
[handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]
Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']
It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.
This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?
Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.
[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]
Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
[talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.
You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
[whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'
You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly]
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
What are you doing? Those are my keys.
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.
Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
[grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.
That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.
No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
Yeah, and we���re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
I���m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Listen to me! I love you! And I don���t care that Phillip���s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.'
No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]
Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
[whispering] I don���t know. I just don���t know.
Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]
[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that���s great.
All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.
Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part]
So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!'
I���d love to be in the loop, David.
I heard you say ���well��� the first time.
[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You���re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark���s shoulder]
I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]
Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.
[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
You���ll always have the upper hand, when you���ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ��� how do I put this ��� steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let���s go!
I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!
[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?
Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It���s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]
Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
Maybe you do. Hi. I���m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It���s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can]
Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
[still typing] He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] ���Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.���
[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
[wearing a face guard] I've almost had my nose broken a dozen times.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
I do. But you married my worst enemy.
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that���s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]
All you have to do it say it.
Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.
[golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat]
This is where I saw that deer last week.
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.
I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
Hoist him aloft. C���mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]
[enters main office, group claps] Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
Don't be mad, it is a business trip.
Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?
Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.
I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
And this chair���s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
Okay, here���s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can���t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]
[on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I...
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial.
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ��We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
[singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.
I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
Okay, now here���s the plan. I���m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!
I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
... is there any news on the leads?
Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
[laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There���s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ���the White Whale���. Look at all that sweet blubber.
Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
What is that in your ear? [pretends to pull beet seed out of Ryan's ear] A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.
Wow. So much crap. It���s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
This is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
No, we haven���t ordered anything. No one���s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
[struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]
My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'
I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
[Toby uses tester on wall as Erin marks wall with red tape X] Oh, god.
[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
This interview is over. I'll let you know.
I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.
OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.
That doesn���t sound crazy, Jim. That���s the sanest thing I���ve ever heard.
And you will be hearing from the -
Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.
[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
[shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]
So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]
Look at him. I���ve never seen such a beautiful child.
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.
Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
He���s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you���re saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.
What?  No, this is about the right size.
Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.
Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
Euughh��� Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present��� Hey.
There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but���
Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!
Oh, I bet you think it���s all about core, huh?
Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?
I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.  [bites into the sandwich half, chews]  Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat.
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let���s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man���s closet.
[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.
[to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
[shouts from another room] What did you do?
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
So, you can tell your clients: ���Unleash the power of the pyramid.���
I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
I'll do it! I always say, 'You want something done right? Ask Dwight.' Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
[taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!
Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]
You know what? I made you a cd...
I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, 'that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.' And I said, 'I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.' Well, hello Danny!
OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
[to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
Paranoid? I���m not familiar with the word. And I really don���t have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?
[exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive.
No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying]
Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
I have no way of knowing if that's true.
Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
No, I'm an inland. Am I a mountainous?
Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can���t believe you came.
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
[typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we���ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War���
Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here���s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That���s not true.  Just give me another chance.
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?
Don���t worry, it���s just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It���s just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
No. And the sheets are made of fire.
Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]
And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]
Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
Not true. And if they did, they couldn't because I'm password protected.
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
[scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]
Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]
Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
No, you're not because I spent hours on it.
Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight]
You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.
Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?
Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.
Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist]
I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they���re out of the house.
The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk]
[Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel.
Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can���t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.
Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.
Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.
Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!
I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we���ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no��� Freak, I need a favor.
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.
[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?
Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]
[slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
Does he have access to their medical records?
Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
Do you live in a regular sized house?
Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!
Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So���[clears throat]
What do you think?  You've got an hour.
I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That���s Lloyd.
[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
[jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]
Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
I know. I know exactly what to do.
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
Oh, I doubt you���ll make it. Very few do who���ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you���ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
[bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!'
Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He���s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He���s my tribe.
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
So I���ve got your resume here, but it���s not telling me everything.
Shhh.  Don't be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle]  ...oh no.
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
