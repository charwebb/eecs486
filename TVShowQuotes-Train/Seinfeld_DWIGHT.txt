I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]
[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, ���perfect pork anus��� which I don't mean.
N-no there's not.
Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
Kids? You don't even have a girlfriend.
Michael.
Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.
[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
Nice.  Do you have any blonde women?
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
I feel like I made the right choice. Things happen for a reason. I wasn't destined to go to Cumberland Mills. Just like Anakin Skywalker was destined to become Darth Vader, I am destined to sell paper here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what I was put on this earth to do.
Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.
Don���t listen to him.
That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
Okay---
What's it of?
Do you love me or not?
Vagina and-
C���mon.
Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
[takes contract] Absolutely, I will.
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance.
Thanks for inviting me along.
You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
Put your fingers here.
Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute.
That's exactly what I said.
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
Psssh, no.
Eh, I've been sitting all day.
Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin]
Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.
Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
No. Putting a load on more like it.
Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
Yeah.
Okay, I can do that.
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Sex.
No.
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
Standing.
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
We are going to have two men's rooms.
Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...
You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
If you want to tell me -
This is how I breathe.
Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
We'll see.
What?
Aaaarrhh!  [kicks over Christmas tree]
Sure.
[after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.
[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
Seventy-two hours.
Oh! [collapses]
Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back]
While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They���re extraordinary.
I don't even know what to say.
I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Yes.
Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
[duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]
Fresh hot ink.
I got a splinter.
Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
[counts down in French]
Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
Uh huh.
[opens eyes wide in total surprise]
Do it.
Let me out or you're fired.
Oh, yes.
Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
Spoken like a true root man.
Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
[shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
The fire guy! The fire guy!
I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.
Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
Okay, this isn���t working for me, ���cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I'm in pain.
Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
Yeah, Meredith.
Take a good look at this boy...
[grunting, shouting]
Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
Ohhhhhh!
You were making me do things that were not all right.
Guilty!
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
Thank you.
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
Surveillance, gaming- and business.
Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
Good, we have a deal?
Pleasure.
They have some great kitchen ideas.
[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]
This is smaller than your old place.
I have to go to the hospital.
It's going very well.
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
You seem suprised.
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.
Do it now.
Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over.  I'm sorry.
Yeah Jim.
[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]
To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
What is wrong with
Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
Kathy.
I can't see.
You���re a good assistant, Jim.
Thank you. [everyone begins to leave]
Andy, I can't hear this right now.
It would be better if you were unconscious.
Would you like to have a vacation this year? That's what I thought. [continues eating Tootsie Rolls] Mmm, delicious.
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That���s right. You���re fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They���re a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We���d go in pretending to be family ��� brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store.  Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.
You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
No, you know what? You do it.
He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
Hey.
Hey. Hey. Jerry.
Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
Great.
OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Come on, shooter!
Jim is essential to th-
You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
All right! What is going on here?
I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.
It's, it's latched closed.
Oh God... ��Hey no! Where do you think you���re going? You���ve gotta stay for the big presentation we���ve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He���s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
Well...
Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
[reading the note with the gay-dar]  'Hope this helps.  -Jim'  Nice!
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
Will end completely!
Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
Right. Okay? Great.
Just hush.
Action.
Ghaaa!
Let's go.
It's in the name.
I will.
I will. I will. You need to calm down.
Like the spirit of Christmas!
No.
No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
What's going on, Michael.  Talk to me.
[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?
Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he���s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
[on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?!
Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]
That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!
I do!  I want some man meat!
Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...
Some of these kernels have crowned.
This is not at drill!
She loves me.
you said to just...
I'm not cr-- uhh!
Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
One of the warehouse guys.
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
I'm gonna answer Charles first.
I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
What did you do to it?
You���re not getting my clients! Nice try.
Well I will prove you wrong.
I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
I am nigh!
[to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
What? Shirts on or off?
Before I go, may I?
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Get out of Jim���s seat.
[nods to camera]
No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
Hallowed ground.
Well...
Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
Maybe over a beer after she���s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
What did you just call him?
I'm barren, Jim.
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
I'll do a shot, Michael.
Why him?
Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
Well, saddles��� [clicks tongue, whinnies] ��� sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
What?
Vietnam sounds.
Please, I can double your pace.
Yep.
[laughs hysterically] I got her!
[coughing] It's still stinky.
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
Aggggh, that stings!
This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
Wrong. [walks away] Thank you Jim. Kevin. Stanley. [whispering] Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. Pam, Jim, Kevin, Stanley. You finished?
Battlestar Galactica isn't a documentary exactly.
I do not have a knife!
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
Probably. [walks away with beans]
Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
Big day for you.
It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
No communication with the outside world Jim.
These covers are totally indestructible.
Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert���s home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file]
[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.
Guten tag, Herr Michael.
I need to make a sales call.  Please?
[has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.
No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
Huh?
I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
I will tell on you.
I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
Now watch, let me take you from behind.
[sighs] It's firm.
[surprising Kelly] Aha!
No. We can���t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.
It's not rabid.
Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.
[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
I'm Jigsaw, idiot.
[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
No.
That���s a bit extreme.
[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
Woohoo!
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?
What?
No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
What is it? Who wrote it?
Jethro Tull...
...with you. [chuckles]
I'm about to buy this building, you know.
That���s impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don���t vibrate at all.
Which is?
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
It was rotting.
What makes you think you���d be an effective paper salesman?
Very funny Jim.
I can get you exotic meats ��� hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Thanks.
You did this, didn't you?
What's that?
Andy! Leapfrog! [Andy leapfrogs Dwight]
Possibly.
Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
[pointing at Toby] There he is. That���s Lloyd.
Outside of work.
Pam.
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
More of a, barbaric growl.
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!
Looks serious.
What? This is such bullcrap!
So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
Go ahead and just read the frosting.
Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
Six percent, I know my worth.
[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
[on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?
No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
He says Thank you.
Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
No, no. No spoilers. Please.
Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
Is somebody after you?
You know how I feel about IHOP.
So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?
No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.
Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
My cervix is ripening.
Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
Okay. You wanna do this the hard way. We'll do this the hard way. You wrote down those fake diseases didn't you?
one noise complaint, several speeding tickets.
Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
You're the stupid one.
So I���ve got your resume here, but it���s not telling me everything.
[holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.
No.
Thank you.
Question? May I investigate?
Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim���s desk while he���s away in Philly. Finally I���ll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It���s like, ���Really, Jim? You don���t understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.��� Wow.
The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Word.
Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
Men find me desirable.
Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That���s it? Oh, that���s great. That���s like a five second delay.
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
Good morning Michael.
[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.
No.
Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]
[runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.
It's from both of us.
It's small, I know.
Men find me desirable.
Yours doesn't.
That's on a need-to-know basis.
God.  Where is Jim?
[holding mini-fan]  It slipped.
Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.
[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
Maybe that's how you die.
We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
I...
No you can't do that.
Thanks so much Earl.
Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
Yeah, let's go.
I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Terrible mistake.
Apparently.
Come on.
Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
No.
You had to, what other choice did you have?
Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!
It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
Okay, Jim.
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
Not literally.
Stop it!
[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
[tests smoke detector] Good.
No. Phyllis, you're not...
If I were you...
Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!
[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
And for���oh, whoopsie daisy. [chuckles]
[sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.
[takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
Are there any bloggers around?
Attention blue collar workers!
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
What are the specs?
But you're the one who picked today.
Okay, I'll drive.
That's bad.
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
[to Nellie] I told you.
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who���s the father of her child?
Okay.
[to troy] Do you have powers?
[with conviction] Start the party.
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
Accountability booster.
No, you���re not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ��L--
C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]
I'm not answering that. You answer it.
My cousin Mose told me a joke.
Aren't they magnificent?
But that's my sale. This is my sale, Michael!
It's a terrible idea.
Oh, no. What's wrong?
Come and get it!
Hey, hey!
You didn't have to.
Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don���t see them so I think we���re good.
[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
Bow down before Recyclops.
Not now, Temp.
I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
(Bleep)
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
Get up off your desks!
I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
[begins playing recorder]
[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
My idea!
Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
Does that include the garage?
No.
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]
Yes, exactly!
Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
I���ll get my apprehension kit.
[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
Leave, get outta here.
Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
Tell him, not Dwight.
Andy���[knocks] I need to talk to you.
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
Whoa!
Shh Shh.
Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
I don't know.
Angela, not here!
[coughs sentence] You're the idiot!
I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]
Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
It was his birthday, just turned three. So���
I missed you Kevin.
Good evening.
Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
Such a chorus girl.
No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He���s a Dunder-Mifflin man. He���s my tribe.
No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
Pam.
Eh, it's not worth it.
Spin move.
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
Menstrual cycles.
Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]
Oh, you're kidding me!
Ok.
Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
Oh, man, it's really back there.
You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
You did.
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
I know.
Don't make me fire you.
[to camera] Same thing.
Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
You most certainly did not.
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
You must use a lot of paper.
Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
What do you think history is?
I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.'
Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.
Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]
You don't work here! You're not Jim!
My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
The bride and groom? What are their names?
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.
That's a common swindlers trick.
Never mind. Just never mind.
[continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.
Hey buddy, so every-
Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
[talking over Michael] God, what a steal.
Big smiles folks! There they are.
[excited] Get out! I���m a dad!
That���s true.
No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
What lab did these little clones escape from?
Uh, Oh.
Hey Jimmy, what's up?
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
There were. A lot of them.
Damn you.
Yeah.
You throat-rip.
As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
Where are they?
Ow.
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
And anoth���
Hey, IT guy.
Text went through.
Sniffling how?
Where?
I don't know.
Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
Seriously?
Excellent.
What?
Still an important position. Still a chief.
pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.
Same thing.
Jim couldn���t land me in a thousand years.
Oh, nothing much. What's up with you?
Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!
What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
[while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
[straightens Andy's tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
Now what?
Okay?
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
First present, Oscar.
Jim, what do you say?
Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-
Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk]
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
Oh.
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers]
Michael.
Okay, who moved my desk?
Just slip it off my���Slip it off my hips.
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
No! [lunges for a large wooden spool]
Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
Really?
Yes!
Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]
From Jim.
That's a conflict of interest.
[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
Shut up.
I would remember.
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
[referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
He sure left in a hurry.
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.
Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
Salad.
Dunder-Mifflin.
It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
All right.
There's a hose out back.
[wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?
A knife.
I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
Yes.
[sighs]
Yes you will.
And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.
I knew it. Is it waterproof?
It will just take a second.
Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
[hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
Well, it should be.
Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.
Tootenbacher.
Well ���
[whispering] What do you need from me?
Got it.
Ah, much, ok.
Oh, our contract.
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
Oh, you think they���re my only friends? I���ve got way more friends than that, and they���re all better than the losers who work here.
I, Jim Halpert...
I'm gonna save you!
Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
I hit a bear.
Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
Take me to Robert.
[punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]
[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
No, I can't... I ca...
Hey, Michael.
Yes you can.
Just, write it down, please.
Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
I will pay you whatever it takes.
It means ���excellent���. And we have begun.
Kevin, not now.
[whispers] I���d love to invest.
Gabe? You don't know?
Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
Question.
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
[on the phone] I understand.
I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]
Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that...
[stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.
Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?
No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
Amazons.
Waste of a good hatchet.
You wanted to see me?
I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
And she called it nuts?
Dwight Schrute. My father's name, also Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name, Dweide Schrude, Amish. That's my family. I don't know where they came, the Amish, came from originally. Uh, Amland.
Oh, I bet you think it���s all about core, huh?
Yeah. What?
I can see that as a very real possibility.
What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ���Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.��� [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
I think she's efficient.
What are you saying?
That's what she said.
Where were you yesterday after work?
What?
It is so on!
...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
Don't set it to yourself!
Take a stand!
Wait, Jim, no! Don't drink directly from the can. Okay, I'm serious. It's all over the Internet. They use the same shipping company as a rat poison, and it gets on the can. [Jim takes a drink] Well, you're an idiot.
Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
I love you!
You're wearing loafers!
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?
I'll have a cup of a coffee.
Don't do it!
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
A bazooka. You remembered.
You don't want to know.
I have been my whole life.
You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...
Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
Hey.
Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
Did you see the board?
Opus dei.
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
It is my duty...
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
I can see that happening.
[talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.
No.
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
Stop giggling.
Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now?  It's not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.
All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
Go, get up there right now.
Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
Come on, folks!
I want to do this.
You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
You���re the Quizno���s. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn���t quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
Yes!
Impossible.
That's unacceptable.
Absolutely... not.
We need to talk!
Phyllis, no, no. Do not listen to her. She's out of her mind.
Ready? What do you think?
Interesting choice...
Listen up.  Let's start... from the ground
[Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
Never!
Go move some paper!
Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Lie still, lie still.
[clapping] No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect.
Jim, what are you doing?
Damnit! Damnit Jim!
I can't say [clearinng throat noise]?
[tearful laugh]. Get out of my way.
YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.
Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
Take a bowl and pass it down.
.. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]
There���s no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
Is it?
I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn���t picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
No.
Pfft, ���Athlead���? Please. They���re too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it ���Stumpany,��� for ���Stupid Company.���
Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!
Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
While you were gone...
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]
[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
Give it a whirl.
It's not the greatest one either...
Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
That's just absurd.
No way, it's the KGB.
That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
Stanley, could you come with me, please.
Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?
I know that's what he said.
Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?
My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
What?
I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
Oh my god.
They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
Well, well, well, it���s finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
Oh my god.
But I'm right?
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.
These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face]
[laughing] Boom!
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
Oh come on.
You read my mind.
We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
[raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.
Good.
Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
So, let's get it going.
Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot.
Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] ���Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.���
On three. One... two... three.
We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]
So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan���s costume and check out his notes.
Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.
Alleged contract.
Assistant Sensei.
It means like this. [snaps fingers]
Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
I'm on official business.
Shh.
Yes I did.
What is that?
[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...
[as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.
Can you breathe?
Fine. Five times. [signs contract]
Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
A hunter.
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
You���ll always have the upper hand, when you���ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
But then no one can see us.
A net? a giant net?
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
[changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
Wait. Are you saying...
[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!
Well, maybe they won't get slashed if you answer all my questions.
[scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
Thank you.
Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]
Game on!
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Really?
I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
...that risks contaminating the other food item. Read the official kitchen regulations memo.
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
Me.
If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
No women or children. Unless provoked.
Do you mind? The men are talking.
The website is hiding, forming alliances with other sites, preparing an attack for which we will have no defense.
I'm gonna say 30.
She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...
[hands Erin a basket of beets]
Lake Erie.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
Silence?
For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
Yeah.
I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
He looks like your twin.
Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
Have you collected the money from everyone?
Who is Justice Beaver?
Loser.
Admit it. Admit it.
What is a scented candle?
I want to be here when you fire her ass.
This party is going to be awesome.
And I have to say your leadership...
No! You���re not helping, Trevor!
Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn���t seem so macho now, does it? It���s a jump rope!
[Bus pulls into lot] Bring it in!
Just doing my job.
Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other���s minds. You���re trying to give your wife this job.
Okay, and remember-you're not gay.
Wrestle him to the ground.
Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
Oh.
Really?  'Cause Ryan says so?
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]
Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.
Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.
Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
Sure
Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Yeah, get them, Creed!
How many in your party?
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
Same page. Just keep moving.
Hey, he can handle it.
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
Oh. Terrible idea.
Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.
Smasher? No, where���d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city���s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]
Cause you're sweeter than candy.
Give me that.
Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand]
...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
Yeah!
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
Yes.
Absolutely not.
You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls.  We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
Yeah...
[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
Okay, go ahead, they're right.
So can we come in?
Kill or be killed.
Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
I found twins.
Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
Feast on this, Lewis.
It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
Fine, let���s go. [grunts]
You can't do that.
I'm doing my job.
So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
Which one is it?
Are you sure that's going to work?
Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
I am ready for my performance review.
Yep.
Jim.
Okay?
All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
You're not allowed to play two-player. You need to start over.
Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound.
It's not effeminate. It's festive.
I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
You know it.
Gotcha! Why are you late?
Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it���s your call.
[phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he���s free anytime. Not a problem.
Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
[laughing together] Yeah!
First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
Michael, I...
[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
[finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.
[putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
If you want.
What did you say?
You're lying.
Mm.
Come along, afterthought.
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
How ya feeling, better?
[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!
Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool.
Like Angela in accounting.
By hand.
You're supposed to be a cat?
Waste of time.
Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]
This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.
What? Are there two suns?
Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel.
Good! Okay. Flirt away.
Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
Hmm?
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?
Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
Saleswoman has a vagina.
[grunts in frustration]
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
Wow.
I don't think so.
Shove it through! Break it!
Sometimes it hurts Michael.
Is that a sumo suit?
Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
Cow, goat or sheep.
I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
What?
Come on pretty boy.
Snakes are waterproof. So, I'm betting that it's waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
Oh, no. Oh, no!
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Rhythm and blues...
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can���t believe you came.
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
No, no. No margarita. Hot sake.
[on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?
Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it���s over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
[on phone with Jim] I hope you���ve been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it���s time for another episode of ���Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire���.
Who is this?
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
[on the phone] Humor works in...
Do you have the Sharpie?!
So you excited?
Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.
No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
I know you did.
Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.
Watching?
It���s just one thing. Just let me���let me do this���
What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
Ah damn pop-ups.
Really.
Oh��� really.
How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
I do not!  I do not say 'Hi' Pam!
Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.' Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
[sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.
It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
They should not be in that room.
How long has he been in the bathroom?
That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
Some sort of virus?
Wha ��� what is this supposed to be?
You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
Please.
Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].
As Assistant Regional Manager...
[employees chuckle] And he
Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.
Do you know how to use it?
No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
I didn't lose my desk.
Monkey. [kisses her]
Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby.
No.
You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin.  I am 99% sure.
Hey, did you SMS text message me?
Yeah!
The leads are in?
Hold still, woman!
[laughs while spray painting ���Jim is Awesome��� on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
No, you're too close.
Can I talk to you about something?
Okay. Let's go. Step up.
I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
Yes. I would welcome it.
What's going on?
I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
I could have stopped him.
Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
[sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
Aye.
I got it.
I think it did.
All right, I'll take them.
He said he would do the same for me.
What is this?
[grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.
Come on!!
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
I have a copy of your key.
[scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.
Hey. Enjoy your new clump.
What is?
[as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.
This. Ends. Now.
Jackpot.
Don't.
Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
Mmm-hmm.
What? [turns and sees Phyllis; Phyllis gasps and drops the box in her hands]
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he���s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it���s an idea. But what does it mean?
Yes. Fast food. I���ll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
That's really fattening.
Calves. Calves all the way.
Here���s how I���m going to help out from now on. I���m going to not care, and I���m going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy���s inevitable demise.
[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
Not good.
[Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!
Also, he slept with Pam.
Oh no, I���m spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?
[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Queen's higher.
Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela]
Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
That's a total waste of your 'M.'
Jim!
To be burned!
Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]
You didn't poison me, it's just stress.
You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
[on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
Yeah!
That's totally unfair. I was just in the ladies' room in order to spy.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Aah!
Excellent question.
What?
Michael?
Can you give me a second, sir.
Because we're friends.
You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
No! I don't want natural!
You stop.
Thank you very much for that.
Get in.
They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no��� Freak, I need a favor.
[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
Okay.
What?
Temp, shouldn't you be monitoring the progress of people's cleaning efforts?
Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
Mm-hmm. Good luck.
Hey David.
It's too small.
[Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying.  When my workers-gather-
I am a farmer Angela.
Definitely.
Were you absent?
Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
Hello, Angela.
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
Hey, Jan.
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
Did he threaten you?
Hey buddy.
You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
That is not true.
Death to Toby!
I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
So don't.
[at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
You know we live together, right?
Crap.
How do I look?
Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
Really? That���s interesting. ���Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who���s here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]
Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...
[bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
Ahh!
Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
Pssht.
Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]
Have you finished with the sketch?
I was here first.
[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.
Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
Extend the fingers more.
How long before?
Hey, it's not a surprise.
Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
All their top clients I can't believe it.
[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
Can I do some of the talking?
Can I drive?
It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
Good shocks.
What do you think I am saying to you?!
You are?
Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
Everybody!
It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
[winks] I'm on it. [leaves room]
You should go.
The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'
You've done more then you can possibly know.
Leave the keys!
Did you get anything good?
Yeah, do tell.
Michael, wait. Let me go.
You sure?
Move to the side of the road!
[looks over and sees hole in his present]  Crap.  [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up]  Come here you.
Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
On an innocent baby.
Want to take a rake... .
If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
Recyclops will have his revenge.
How about 5:15?
That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
Why would I put a banana in my holster?
[joins in] Shrute! Shrute!
Hey. [shuts door] Is everything okay?
I wanted to offer you a new position.
Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don���t know where I���d put you.
I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]
I���d have to get some more wire and string, but it���s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
But this isn���t interim manager. No. It���s Dwight K. Schrute��� [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
Dwight Schrute.
I really don't think so.
All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
Thank you, Angela.
No!
Jim!
Really?
Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.
It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
[is seen taking apart his phone receiver to check for listening devices]
To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
Seal it off with drywall so you don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there all the time.
I'm being sabotaged.
Ed was decapitated.
Okay, I���m gonna need you to print it out.
At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
[drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!
Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.
Then we meet at the Denny's...
Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
Dammit! [hangs up]
Oh. [dumps drink out]
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.
I decided earlier.
Now. Now. Now.
A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
Parley, my office, five minutes.
Not now! Private time!
Washington Monument.
Search his things.
I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]
Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
Where are all the animals?
Yeah.
Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says ���I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt��� unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?
Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?
Do you have the Sharpie?!
Not all the time.
Seedless?
Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
What branch?
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
Well, I���m the one offering the job.
[to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
I am not a liar.
Everyone.
No.
Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
Michael! Michael!
Hello, Dwight Schrute?
What?
Thank you.
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I���m sure he���d give a reference.
Phyllis.
No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
Okay, get out of here.
Yeah, you said...
Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
No, that was my Sensei.
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
That was your idea.
Then I will.
We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief]
He totally misses,
Fail!
I told you.
Euughh��� Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present��� Hey.
I am not bluffing!
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
He���s been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
Yes!
This is how business...
Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]
Good, do you see what I'm saying?
You remember my cousin Mose.
Mmmnnnnmmm...
You don't know?
I have absolutely no idea.
If I guess, will you tell me?
Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
Clarinet.
What?
So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.
[loudly applauds] Yes.
I think I should be there.
And then I inserted my penis-
However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
It's a job interview, not a flea market.
Would that be such a bad thing?
I didn't say anything
Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?
I don't wanna move desks!
Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.
Yeah, but no nipples.
Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
Guys, it wasn���t up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn���t my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies' room wall.
He was dead the whole time.
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
[off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?
....back orders and you never called them.
Okay, I just...
I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
...Okay.
Like hell you are.
Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
Hmm?
You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
That never happened. He���s always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught ���saving treats��� from the kitty litter box.
Yes.
Jim, you're the new schedule guy, huh?
Okay.
I don't get that, I don't understand that.
Thank you Sandra!
Cause you���re interested in going into sales?
We don't take debit cards, anyway.
[still off screen] Carol had a mustache?
But you work tomorrow.
People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they���re out of the house.
You successfully backed down the mob!
It���s a root you idiot.
Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
Really funny, Michael!
Could I have a copy of one of them?
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Oh.
[puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
Frosting.
Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
Stay out of this, you!
[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
No, I wanna seduce her.
We gotta see what he's got.
Maybe you've got mono.
Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Oh, no!
Rule three: Don't fall in love.
It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
You're welcome.
What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
Yep. He'll be fine.
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.
How do I apply?
Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?
Yeah.
Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah!  Aa-aaah! [throws it ahead of the car, it goes for a while and then is stopping]  It's a hardy stroller. [takes watermelon out of stroller, holds it up to show camera] Maybe it's safe!
[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]
Fine.
You're the best.
Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
That!
Who are you talking to?
I'm on it.
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.
Eiffel Tower.
He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
So you���ll do it?
...before noon...
Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
Action.
Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
You believe a computer can beat me?
Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]
It���s by the tenderloin.
Hey.
You got a better way?
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don���t even care about nationals.
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
Watch your step.
Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
I'm talking about... hmmm.
Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
Rule two: we stop at nothing.
I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.
[looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this.
I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
That's impossible.
[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!
For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.
Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
Hmmm?
[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
[sighs] Sixty - forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I'll drive.
There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]
Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
Oh, man.
Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
Yes. I am.
Merry Christmas.
My calls?
It's in my purse.
Um, what about you?
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
N... it's complicated.
Michael is your superior.
Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
Hi, I am Dwight Schrute, Mr. Scott's associate.
But then you wouldn't have me here.
That is correct.
Let's go check out the master bedroom.
Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
Ok, good
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
I���m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We���ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
Please take an agenda item.
25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
You're twenty minutes late!
I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?
What?
-Cornell Application Department,
Yeah.
Give me the dice!
You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
[in Jim's office]  Sign this.
[lets go] Good morning.
Where did you get those?
You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Hey Pam.
Ha, nerd.
Pam, would you care for a bagel?
Weird.
I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
Is that true?
[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
Yes! We advance to the next round!
It's a sales call.
Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
Kelly?
Good. How are you doing?
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.
Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
Hey, HEY.
Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
Surprise! [laughs]  Everybody!
Yes.
It's a mini-briefcase.
I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.
[marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
That would be nice wouldn't it?
Idiot.
Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Thank you.
I have to do something to his eyes.
That's not going to happen.
Hey... Why did you do it?
It doesn't make any sense.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
I know. I could just bang you right now.
What did you---
Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
I don't get to wear my ties.
No.
Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
[again] Assistant Regional Manager.
Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?
Shotgun weddings.
OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
[Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
But that's illegal.
[crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]
[fires tranquilizer gun at Stanley]
Which one's yours?
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
[singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
Lock your door!
[taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!
No.
Any specific animal?
I'll ask you a question.
Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
Also, it's icky back there.
Coolio. Coolio.
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
[in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
Gosh, Mommy feels like taking a jog. [runs with stroller]  Oh, no!  Mommy forgot to wear a bra, and her big fake boobs are really hurting her, and she needs to let go, she can't control the stroller any longer [forcefully pushes stroller away toward uneven ground with junk strewn around, the stroller hits some junk, stays upright, and stops safely]
Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
How as being a minority affected you?
Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
Yeah...
Make-up sex. Nice!
I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they���re protecting America���s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day���s security codes. Something that���s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It���s not the KGB, but it���s a start.
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
Right over by that fence.
Yes!
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
Jan knows paper.
[yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
You wanna eat, don't you?
$100 a day, plus expenses.
I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
No.
Hey, what are you listening to?
Go on.
Yeah, you don���t want Italian. You���ll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you���ll be doing life in Rikers Island.
OK, what's up?
Idiot!
Yes.
Hurl your feces.
Hope - grows.
What?
No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]
I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
Basement office? You mean like a lair?
You'll be fine over there.
Really?
No!
[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
Tokyo?
No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.
It hasn't always been easy being a whistleblower. When I was in school, the kids would call me a tattle-tale or a snitch or a worm. So I really identify with those women from Enron. I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.
No way!
The new IT guy. Nick.
Excuse me, I got a question for you.
Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her.
Doesn't matter.
Hello.
[laughs] I think you know.
Obesity-caused illnesses.
I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]
Hit the nos.
Let's get this roof going.
And I���ve never seen you go to work, ever.
Ah! [throws punch] That���s how it���s done.
Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
You failed?
If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
So you're taking a personal day?
He is a goner.
Oh [half-heartedly throws something]
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
[to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
I take full responsibility.
Oh my God.
I know. You���re gonna be okay, Monkey.
[forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]
You think I don���t have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I���ve got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne���er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don���t need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
What? What's so wierd?
Are you really not going to punch him?
I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
Tent, rainfly, gorp...
Mm-hmm.
Alright.
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]
First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
Damn it. God!
Where?
I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
No, Michael.
You choose!
Keep an existing...
Yes!
Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
Aha! A lightbulb.
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
What's a dis... what's that?
Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
Poor hornet.
Oh, so glad I could help.
Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
Yum.
But the little cars go in the compact spot
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
That's it.
Don't do anything rash!
Karen Filippelli.
She was stoned apparently.
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Message in a Bottle, The Postman...
How would you do that?
Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley���s got way more body fat than they do.
Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
I didn't order anything.
Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
No, no. Give me the steam.
No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
Admit that there is a chance.
I apologized for that.
Kevin Costner.
Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
Wait, what Holly said?
Gotcha! Yeah! Let���s see ya get out of this web, huh?
Where?
The power source.
I'm not answering it.
You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]
Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Got 'em. Go!
Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
What for? We haven���t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren���t deep fried, right?
What can I do better?
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
Okay that's-
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
Okay, okay.
Dry. Delicious.
Your fictitious name?
Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.
You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
[tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!
All right!
This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
So we're choosing...
Doesn't matter.  I'll escort you!
Danger.
Where did you get that mallard?
Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
[Dwight come into office unshaven]  What?
There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
has brought...
[standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!
You were on a boat.
Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.
Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
You would?
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Oh, don���t lie. I���m trying to save those precious knees you���re always bragging about. ��Now, let���s get out of here. He could be right behind us.
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]
Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
Damn it!
Yeah. [Jan starts to get up] Easy there, old girl. [tries to help her]
So, you can tell your clients: ���Unleash the power of the pyramid.���
I work with Michael.
So am I.
[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.
It was playful hazing.
Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
There���s no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
Could be a bat weevil��� Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
And how big do you want this robot?
Steak. Rare.
Little of this, little of that.
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
What kind of mileage does this baby get?
They could do better.
One more. To our boss!
Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I���m about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
How many fingers am I holding up?
Yes.
What?
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.
Do this. Come on. Ready?
Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
Uh, duh.
If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
So���
Well, you have...
And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
Loyalty.
I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
Like those?
Command central.
[laughs] What do you think?
Yes!
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They���re not for me. They���re for my cousin Mose. He���s just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
What was your mile time?
Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Aaaaaaaa!
Right here.
Can I be your representative?
Nothing.
I am so sorry.  I'm so sorry, sir.
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
Aah!
That's great.
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
No thanks I'm stuffed.
[scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.
I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
To keep secrets from my computer.
I knew you would, Nancy.
Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?
But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
All right. Are you okay?
[shakes fist, whispers] Yeah!
Assistant regional manager.
[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
Aye aye, Captain.
Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?
Up here. [whistles]
He's not a songbird.
Get your clouds right.
Jim, don't interfere.
Mine was green.
Jim talked too much.
Fire Jim.
Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
What is the antidote?
Later on.
Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]��� Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
Wait, sales���what sales meeting?
500 and one penny.
[incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.
[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here���s something. Who would eat who in an ���Alive��� situation. No... that can���t be it.
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
Oh I am. In my own words.
It's from Battlestar Galactica.
Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
You apologize right now.
[leaving] We'll bill you.
Alright.  I'll call you, kid.
What's next?
The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
Um.
Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
We're not allowed to use the baler.
[places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]
Oh, yeah.
Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
Got it.  Carb up.
Chicken fight!
Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
Not my urine.
No. I���ll be damned if I���m gonna let us lose me.
[Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
I can see the security guard's eyes.
Any employee may dispose a food item...
No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
You know what? I'm a little busy.
He's searching out younger gays.
Yeah!
Okay.
No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Dumatril.
[interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
I can make him talk, Michael.
That���s great. Let���s do this guys.
You may have...
I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
I
[gets up from chair] Write legibly people.
And this chair���s gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
[on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
Still.
You want rabies? Be my guest.
This is so awesome.
Not the living in fear, that's new.
[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
That was the sick one, right?
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
[Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
Okay.
[singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
Pam, please call security!
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
[bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight���s desk]
The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
All right.
God... Damn it! Why us?
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
Then I would bring an axe, no books.
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Quiet, you.
Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
Yes. Yes.
You're thinking of deer penis.
That is true.
Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist]
It's not locked, gimme that...
Dwight Schrute.
And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!
And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]
That means ye, Plop!
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
Hey, you're making me spray!
Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
Hazel.  They're hazel.
Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]
Angela...
It's a good market. Higher volume.
From the downsizing.
I will never, ever let you down.
Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He���s a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I���m hesitant. Why can���t I pull the trigger on any of them?
Come on, break this up.
She sent an email, so.
Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
I was aware that you were speaking.
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
Come on!
Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]
It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Jim --
I'm... discombobulated.
[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
Oh, why not?
Where is my desk?
She called you D?
And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
[laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!
Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
[walking up] Michael?
Where? Dark side or light side?
Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation: There���s a madman in our midst.
They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
The twirl sucks.
[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
[cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?
Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
Or real bombs.
[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
After you.
What are you doing?
Well, they can���t all be winners. But Trevor���s next and he���s a real professional. You say, ���Jump,��� and he says, ���Oh who?��� He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?
This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.  [bites into the sandwich half, chews]  Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat.
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
Had 'em all my life.
OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
You wanted to see me?
Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.
Exactly.
Did I tell you about her teeth?
I don���t need your help.
Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]
If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
Hey.
I'm gonna set your face on fire.
Yeah!
OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
It was Andy's idea.
Three...
Okay.
Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
Yeah I���m serious.
[answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
That's an excellent analogy.
He���s fine. He gets carsick really easily.
[reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.'
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
Why do you want health care, Pam? Hmm? Why do you want it?
Who is the king of Austria?
[bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.
And it's-
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
American Idol? What? No.
You're gonna need to be more specific.
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
Okay.
No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
Iris, thank you so much for having me.
Right, that's good, good, pursue this.
Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
Give me the dice.
Jim!
350 and one penny.
Yeah.
And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
What is this?
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
I see dead people.
Yeah.
That is all. Have a good morning.
[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh���should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.
I was -- I was right.
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
I'll try and think of one. When...
Shut up.
Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
No.
My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
[running from his desk] Ayyyy!
Where did you read that?
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
Yeah!
Calm, please
Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
This is where I saw that deer last week.
Yes.
That's not why you lost.
Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
Yaoo yay! [claps]
Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]
There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
Have you seen it?
And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]
You did. Several times. Over and over again.
Yeah!
I don't need a key.
[falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous.
You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
I'm just --
It's going to be ok.
It���s all right. Andy approved it.
[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
No, it's an accountability booster.
[stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]
I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
Yeah. It's practical.
You're an idiot.
Well today���s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
$200.00
No.
Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
No!
[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard.
It is my idea.
Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
Do you have batteries?
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
It's non-transferable...
Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
No one just called you.
What do you think?  You've got an hour.
You see?
Oh god.
You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
What?
I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?
No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]
Meet my eye line, Jim!
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
[clears throat]
[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.
Christmas card list.
[Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
Uh-huh.
Eight?
Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
Hear anything interesting?
Fine.  Good.
Reply it!
He went to Gabe behind your back.
[out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
Cut.
With today���s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it���s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
I wish I could menstruate.
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl]
Ladies and Gentlemen! I present to you...the Alamo! [reveals lump of ice]
What does it say?
300 and one penny.
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
Oh my���! Oh d���! Oh, how did���? [gasps] Huhhhhh!
Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could���ve met in the lobby. It���s time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?
Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
[scoffs]
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
Damn it! Perfect answer, again.
Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling]  Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
Bye Pam.
See ya later, Trevor.
Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
...so good.
It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.
In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
[scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
Yeah.
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha���You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
Michael.
Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?
Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
I'm thirsty.
Do you own a gun?
I can handle that.
Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.
I'll take that as a no.
It's all right. It's all right.
[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That���s not true.  Just give me another chance.
Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
When I was asking about the leads.
Don't do it, Michael.
I can't-
Stanley.
You snubbed her.
Of course you are.
And circle gets the square.
[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.
How do you know that?
All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J���rg Ro���kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
No, there's no blood.
Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I���ve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I���ve added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I���m doin��� great.
I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
Wow.
Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.
Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]
No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
Oh, just...
Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
[chokes up]
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]
Her kid needs shoes, Jim!
What's the square footage?
Thank you, Jim.
On one condition. You...
What's the exact square footage.
Good night.
The Crow.
No.
Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
And their king bee.
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
That's because they're easy!
I love finding a good set of twins.
YEAH!
In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
You've got a ton of dandruff.
Oh, man!
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
Yes.
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
Really?
And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
Hey, this is none of your business.
Yeah.
No, it's not.
These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
[Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
You don't work with us.
Party's over. You are so busted!
No holding.
[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Pam, I'll help you.
Yes.
I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
So, you ever been convicted of a felony?
That���s me.
[whispering] I want some of those pills.
Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
[alarm sounds] People!
Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
Let the bedbugs bite!
Louder! You���re shouting it from the back of a horse!
Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
Ten.
You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you���ve got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? ���Infuriating, irresponsible���...
He's lying.
He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
[whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?
No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
Sales is about people, Ryan. About understanding them and learning how to get along with them. Case study: me. To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.
Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
What-
[walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry.
This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
What?
For five years I���ve held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it���s time for me to just let that thought go. It���s kind of painful, but it���s also freeing in a way. Now it���s all about my instincts.
No.
Having trouble finding a vein?
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
Oh.
What did you do? Huh?
No.
Drop this one. Abort.
Come on!
[typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
Crisis averted.
[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
This has to do--
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
What are you looking at?
Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
Come on!
Eight minutes!
[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
No, Michael!
The Sting. The Sting.
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is���for���Kevin.
It could be kind of funny.
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
You could ask for an extension.
Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
It's complicated.
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
Define scorched earth policy.
[singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
That's preposterous.
I can't believe this news.  That--- wow.
I know...
Oh, worker's comp, my ass!
Interviewer has suspect motives.'
As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
Go ahead, you do it.
Are you saying you invented paper?
OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I'm really sorry... about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.
Cute kids, thanks for coming.
Copy.
[over phone] Hey-O!
What? You?
So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.
I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
Of course there���s a costume! [laughs] ��Oh, this is gonna be great. There���s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
What would you have done? Been manager?
[clapping] Best Dundies ever.
���But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark���s getting out of my car. He���s a good boy, does whatever I say.
What were you talking about in there?
I will do my voodoo.
Jack Nicholas.
I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
C���mon.
Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It���s like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]
That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
No wait, what are you doing?!
And I was thinking it���s only fair that you help make this decision since they���ll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
Shut up. That's impossible.
Brought it in here-
How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]
Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
[whispers] Coolio.
Stop!  Don't look at me.  On the counter you will find bread, peanut butter, and jelly.  Pretend to make yourself a sandwich.
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again]
I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
There you go.
Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
Who are you calling?
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.
Yeah, right. I���m afraid that ship has sailed.
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
I don't know...
No word from Michael.
[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
Yeah.
Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
Woo!
Yeah.
In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I���ve had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
All Right!
Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
Michael, come on.
Of course.
[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.
How much longer is this going to take?
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
[speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, 'that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.' And I said, 'I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.' Well, hello Danny!
You wrote down... I didn't give you permission to.. I didn't...
I broke it.
Think!
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
Thank you, Michael.
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
I choose Michael!
[clapping] Whoo!
Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.
Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]
Goodbye.
I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
It's fine. What?
I���ve worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I���m an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
I left a message at corporate.
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Yes!
[Reading from computer] ���Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!��� That means you can't make me do squat.
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
[thinks] Interview.
Very impish.
[on the phone] Howard, hello. Dwight Schrute. Dunder Mifflin. Yes, and you are my favorite client. Listen, I'm calling you to tell you a little joke. What is black and white and red and can't think? A nun who has a beet for a head. ... No, I'm Catholic, too.
What? Why would you say that���
No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.
There is no way that hurt.
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let���s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man���s closet.
Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.
Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?
Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
Oh. Of course.
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
That's right.
Why are you looking at my forehead?
Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...
Yes!
No, no, no, no...
I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
Misdemeanor?
[digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?
Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can]
[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
So we know which truck to van...
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
Okay��� Seven, one, one, nine���
Does it have a deck?
OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
...I'll consider it.
Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.
Jeez! What���s he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]
Good luck to you. [disconnects call]
The planet Caprica.
Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!
I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder]
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
Where are gay mens��� vaginas?
No, Michael.
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.
Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
Point it towards the store, idiot!
Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
Good old Mose. [laughing]
I���ve seen enough.
There's one more suggestion.
Good.
What's your win rate?
[pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty.
Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
I got it. I got it.
Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
[excitedly] 'Ok' I can run it?
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
Hello, spoiled little baby, [to a watermelon] in your fancy brand name stroller.  Mmm, I wonder if it's as safe as they say it is.  Oh, look, a curb.  Uh oh, let's see what happens... [lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.  My parents left me beside the road.  I crawled home.
[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
This is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
That's good enough for me. [exhales again]
[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?
OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
He wasn't volunteering today.
I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael ...
When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
State your business!
Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I���m back.
What?
--the party planning committee...
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
Okay. So yeah.
What did they do to you, Angela?
Did you get your tickets?
Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
Assistant team manager?
Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
No. But I am, I am human, right? [Pam hesitates]
Very excited?
This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her]
It's not really 1992 anymore.
It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
What look?
Accept it, why would he come back?
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
[sighing]
Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
Does he have access to their medical records?
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
Like who?  Who doesn't know?
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.
Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
That laugh is so infectious.
Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby]
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]
[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
[on phone] Dwight Schrute.
That snake!
Ding dong.
Gah!
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
Good.
Thank you. I mean, I���ve rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh���
That's how it's done.
What?
What are you doing?
Make way, nope, inspect me.
Pam, are you all right?
Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
Really?  Anything.
You got this kosher certified?
Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
I'm all better.
Those are fighting words.
C���mon, c���mon.
Checks out.
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
Like baboons or elephants.
Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]
Uh huh.
I don't think she'd be missed.
Women look like white slaves.
Erin [eerie voice] Erin...
[golf ball rolls under bookcase] I got it. No problem. [clears throat]
All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]
Oh no, that is too bad.  Shoot.
It could be kind of funny.
Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
What?
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
[To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV.'
One...
Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
Yeah, magnificent worker, marvelous worker, more money for this worker. Man, I like this worker. Mighty worker.  That's good. That's good.
Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Open the gates! There���s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There���s plenty for everyone!
OK, can we steer away from gay people?
Hello, you're back.
Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'
Yeah, deal with it Pam!
Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
Anything else would be inconsistent.
...for people's behavior.
It���s true.
Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
Get lost.
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here���s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
That is not in the contract.
Oh, that's my last one.
At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
Let's see yours.
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]
I do that myself now.
What?
Why do they call him The Bus?
It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.
You made a big mistake. Huge!
He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
No I don't.
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
[running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
Make him be quiet.
No, that is huge.
Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
Please, don't.
Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
[chuckles]
And your affiliation with Cornell -
You���re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we���ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
Let's get the party started.
Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]
Talk me through an appendectomy.
Okay.  Fine.
Argh!
Gentlemen.
No the other thing.
I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
What do you think you're doing?
Fire hazard.
Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'
Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
It's by the ream?
That���s all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
No... no. One crisis at a time.
Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
Unbelievable.
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Good. Good. And...
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
There were only two options.
I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
To intimidate my subordinates.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!
OK, I'm ready.
Kelly is disqualified!
Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I���m sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I���m not in your panties, I don���t go vigilantes. Why don���t you ask your husband?
Found him!
Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
Thanks old man.
But you can say that about anything.
What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
[giggles]
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
Oh, my God.
Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
She's sleeping with you?
Just say it.
Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
Ha ha! Yeah, joke���s on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
[playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that���s really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]
He/she/it throat rips.
Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
Thank you Michael.
Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
Unless we're unplugged.
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
I can... Yes, sensei.
Not so fast.
They are either going to say yes... or no.
What about you?
I know. I know exactly what to do.
Trees!  And where do trees grow?
I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
[drinks] Mmmmm...
Including prep time?
That's it.
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
Let me get that door for you--  [runs to open door]
Yes, you did.
I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
What'd he say? What did he say?
I can't do this.
Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
-But we'll be together then-'
You're thinking of a chicken.
They're testing it now.
Okay, so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department.
Nope, I wasn't bitten.
Two more.
[Wild Side playing] You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Yes, you are. You are gonna give me this raise. Ya! Ya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation, right? You are gonna give me this raise! Why? Because I'm awesome, awesome, yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you for your time, dude. Champ. My lord, mi amigo. Mi amor. Ha! Wild side! I am ready. [groans]
Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]
Yeah!
Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
We have better service than they do!
Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
Actually��� You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I���ll take one too.
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
Michael.
Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
Do you live in a regular sized house?
I never said it was better than an iPod.
When? When did he tell you? Today?
Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me!
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
I...
...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
Been there, done that.
But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
What's your blood type?
I need help.
No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
No.
[Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
Yeah! Woo-hoo!
I'm sorry.
What did I say!?
Perfect casting, right?
If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]
The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
Mmm-hmm.
I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
Jim���wha��� Come on! What���what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
Okay, just shut it.
You know what? I made you a cd...
No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
[throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
What are you-
You are out of order.
So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background]
Turn it around. Turn it around.
[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.
OK you are useless.
They are now.
Not coming, have plans.
Try again��� Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one��� is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
At what time?
Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
Just ignore him.
[quietly] Phyllis?
I don't think she'd be missed.
Thank you, Andy.
Oh, boy. This whole condo's shifting. It's like this place was built on ancient Indian burial ground.
Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
[Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!
So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!
Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
Michael, I don't know...
Jim won't sign my expense report.
Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant
Thank you, Sensei.
I probably care more than she does.
Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.
He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']
Not so weak, huh, Mom?
You know what?
And they said it couldn���t be done. Boom!
Do you know where we are, temp?
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
No.
What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.
I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
Yes.
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
OK.
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
[whispers to Clark] We don���t get along.
What do you want!?!
Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I���m eating Jims.
Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested.
Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.
Mm-hmm. Good safe?
Hiii! [kicks Michael]
That���s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
I volunteered for this job.
Parka...
Tell me where it hurts.
I was trying to go-
[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.
Oh my God, we have to be there.
Shh. Do you hear that?
How convenient.
Shampoo.
Her name?
Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.
I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, 'muffin basket.' Then I thought, 'What���s even more precious to people than muffins?'
Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can���t be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
I want him to have all the urine he needs.
Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
And I turned it down.
Oh God.
They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
What else does it look like?
Five, four, three, two...
My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.
Jim. Definitely.
What will you do?
Okay. What'd you get?
Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.
Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
No! No, Oscar. He���s a friend. He���s a friend.
Try Dwight.
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
[throwing away a banana, mayonnaise, and a sandwich from the refrigerator, smells the mayonnaise] God. [drinks from the milk carton and puts it back] Mmm.
Just ugly enough to have deniability.
Sorry.
Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
Die. You just... You said it.
What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
Yes. And my decision in final.
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
I think I cut my penis on the lid!
Hoist him aloft. C���mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]
It's not fair.
[shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]
What!
The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.
You're welcome.
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
I do!
Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair]
Mega-Desk.
Hi, Mr. Bart.
No, you stop.
You did not just say that! You don���t know Pam. She is really cool.
Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
Yes.
Argggg!
No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.
What were you doing in there?
All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.
Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!
Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Cherry Pie, Warrant.
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
It's Christmas Toby.
Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Well, yeah.
So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
Oh, please.
Excellent.
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
We're here. [gets out of the car]
Cool, let's start with the banisters.
It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.
Mmm-hmm.
Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
The eyes are the groin of the head.
No! Really?
No, okay.
Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
What?
It can���t be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
Wing.
Come here. Come here.
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
That is a damnable lie. I love women.
Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?
You���re working for ���Stumpany��� too?
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
I just don't get it.
Did you say Karen?
Yeah?
[sighs] This is your job, Halpert.
Mocha complexion. Supplier relations. Either caught a fish or was standing next to a man who caught a fish in Key West, Florida.
I'll do the best I can.
[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.
Michael!
Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
Why?
Pow! Pow! Pow!
No, pictures are too interpretive.
Male, age 37...
Keep the wing flaps.
You're back. [surveys Andy] And you're disgusting.
That's my stopwatch.
I want Michael to take me...
That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]
Stay out of this, you!
That's our theme.
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the?
No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
Welcome to the club, pig! [laughs]
God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Busy!
See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!
OK. Good night Ryan.
Oh.
Really?
Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
I will poison your food.
Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
Where did you see it?
Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
Who took all the black ones?
And she is your boss.
This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
It was my pants.
No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]
Classy.
Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
Talk to you later, Jan.
It was pretty awesome.
It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.
It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?
Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]
She probably scrubbed it
Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
I know that. Don't you think I know that?
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?
Hey, hey. Easy.
You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
No, Kevin, come on.
What do you say?
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?
Mmhmm.
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
No, you can stop.
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Great. Get the plate number.
Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.
You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.
Do you
Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
[pause] What?
Thank you Angela.
Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]
All you have to do it say it.
[In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
Do you know what 'snap decision' means?
God, you're such a spy.
No, everything's fine.
What is going on?
Wow!
So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Oh, good, and you resent this because...
[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
Where?
Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Silver medal.
Damn it!
If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. I think I got this. Um, I am treated in a foreign way with a great deal of prejudice. Am I one of those tribes in Africa? The piggies, or whatever?
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
[lifting box] Ugh! Ow.
Just act natural. [grunts]
That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.'
[Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]
Oh, we do. So we���ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
I hope there will be management parables.
Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
I want to see the baby.
OK, where does it hurt?
Daraas!
[examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Rolph, leave it alone!
Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
Mm hm.
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
I insist.
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
Yes ma'am.
Michael?
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?
No. She needs her rest again.
Jim, this is hardly the time.
Yep, he's lying.
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So���[clears throat]
Damn it!
But check that it's covered by your
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
Alright! Uh! [Spanks himself]
Please?
Sh-what?
Dear God in heaven.
I think this whole disaster on Michael's carpet happened for a good reason. Him sitting next to me is a huge gift. This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God, but I don't know about all that.
Look at him. I���ve never seen such a beautiful child.
I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
I got a knock-knock joke.
Thank you.
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
Thank you.
For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
F. Alright, what's the damage?
Okay. [sits]
I'm not-- I'm not following you.
No.
Thanks, girl.
Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
Two to three hours...
You're leaving?
Him. I have got a couple of questions about the neighborhood. Have you had any problems with prostitution, crack dealing, gang violence, etcetera?
It can���t be nothing.
Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
Get your foot behind the yellow line.
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference.
Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the?
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
You really expect me to believe you haven't set a date? I think you have. Sure Pam, sure. But you know what, you've been engaged for three years and I know you've set a date. And you know what else, I know you've got coverage under Roy and I know that you wrote down those fake diseases. Admit it. Admit it, Pam.
Same old.
None taken. What do you got?
There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
Just lice Pam?
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
No, don���t say it. You���re fired! You���re both fired!
Why didn't I go to business school?
Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
[imitating '80s rock]
Humans are terrible for the environment.
Don't even care!
Or none of you [chuckles]
Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]
Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]
[Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
���Higher than numbers go.��� The ceiling above accounting!
No.
For the performance review. Oh, wait, you don't get one. You're a temp.
[yawns, ���Idiot��� is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
He looks great.
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
Final touch-ups.
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
Walk out of the house...
Don't be fooled by the phrase 'dust bunnies.' They are vicious little bitches and if they get inside your disc drive, God help you. They will bring your computer to its knees. They sit in corners hatching, defecating, laying eggs. And their sole purpose in life is to eat dead skin, which humans in this office shed by the boat load. Especially Creed.
Torture.
[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
Huh. Do you like candy?
Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he���s slouching. Okay, can you���sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'
[whispering] He's my best customer.
No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.
Okay, you can stop.
To do something about-
I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
It means they are not expanding.
You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
That is not a statue, that is a robot.
Nope.
Interception. He shoots, he scores, yeah! Michael, try it like this. This'll be much harder.
Right now!
You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
No.
No, like you.
[sighs and picks up Michael's empty suitcases]
My headphones are broken.
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
Everybody!
I'll do--
No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.
I'm peeing in this empty can.
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Oh.
No, no, no.
...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
[whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.
It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
Amazing.
We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!
What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
Yes! As your representative?
[laughs] No!
Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car.
What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face]
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
[sighs]
I think you need to confess...
[coolly] Seems like you already know where.
Pretty good.
Oh. Okay. Fine. Well done.
I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
[looks to Angela]
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Standing.
The pressure!  The pressure!
Hey! It's on the list, everybody.
My belt's made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
People love beets.
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
It's uh, it's in beta testing.
What were your favorite moments?
Security deposit. That's been-
What? It's a casual, social outfit.
You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
Oh.
Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he���s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
Right.
Oh we know.
I got it here.
[lays on bed] Really?  I hadn't noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
Kevin! Doesn't apply.
Tonight.
[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.
[over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
What? Ooh!
No.
Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
[same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...
Yeah.
Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]
Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk]
Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!
Damn it! Jim!
In the ocean.
Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could���ve choked so many people by now.
No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.
Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
What?
Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
They fall under the category of airplanes.
I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
No.
Is that what we were doing?
You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
It's okay, I smell.
And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight]
I'm... I was making it.
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
We will be called Gryffindor.
Yeah....baby.
[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.
Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what���s the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you���re stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don���t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
Man, what is taking Toby so long?
Return it!  Return it now!
No!
What? Something happened?
Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
Oh, not gonna happen.
He's very, very handsome.
Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
It's pony.
It was nothing personal. It���s just that you were terrible at your job.
Oh he's not that nice.
[yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
You have your lawyer there?
It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
[Jo leaves] I, uh...
Yes, I was quilled.
[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
Only one way to find out.
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
Angela.
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
It doesn't make any sense.
They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
I want an answer by tomorrow.
The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves]
[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.
The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.
Do you have your card?
You know, you���re right! We hadn���t even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]
Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
No, but that's sometimes part of it.
Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don���t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So��� have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let���s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So���yes. I���d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there���s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Erin....the receptionist!
Who? Dave Barry?
This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
Where are we going?
Listening.
[re-entering the store] I'll take the wizard!
What?
Come on. Come on.
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
Hope to see you soon.
Ahh-chaa!
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
Hey, monkey, how you doing?
You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ���ahhmmm��� excuse me��� What?! Not now, I'm busy.
There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but���
Come on.
Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
Really?
Toby...
Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
Welcome to our land.
No problem.
Which is, of course���
Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and���
I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
$30,000? There's gotta be another way.
Yeah, you know me.
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
I thought you guys couldn���t come.
Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger���s knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
OK, temp.
Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]
Empty mind.
Hey Santa!
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
What?
For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts: professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He���s gonna be moving slowly. It���s only���
It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
What?
[grunts] Okay, we���re good. We���re good. Let���s go. Push!
What else?
Great.
Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.
Whassup!
Yeah, that'll work.
Forget it. I'll look it up myself.
Have you seen Erin?
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
Thank you.
Really make one.
That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.
Congratulations.
[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Yeah!
I can handle that.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
No! [arguing over each other]
This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet���.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]
[standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
Why is she marrying Andy?
In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
Oh, thank you.
[lying on Michael's desk] Hold me!
What kind of filing?
Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
Meat grinder.
No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
A quilt.  Depression quilt?
Family only.
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Yeah.
Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
No!
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
Alright. First thing in the morning then.
Okay.
Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
You want you to take this pen and this piece of paper and write this down. Write this down.
I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
Okay.
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
Yes.
Is that the last year the data was available?
Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
What happened?
Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
A little eye for an eye action.
Hey, Andy.
It's a statement of fact.
Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.
So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
Okay.
Our first date was at the Anthracite Coal Museum.  We had both been before, but we pretended like it was our first time so we could get all the extra information.  They knew we were faking... 'cause they recognized us.   But we made them tell us all the stories.  All the safety information.  And we corrected them whenever they got it wrong. [Phyllis chuckles and nods, Dwight sighs and takes the rest of his sandwich out of the container and holds it up to Phyllis]   You want half a sandwich?
Hey, temp.
Bye poochie!
There is no shower.
Troy, do you know anything about this?
Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
Oh... no... really?
Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.
I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
He doesn't even want to go.
Excuse me?
Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
God. How do whalers do it?
Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
Ready?
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
Who is the king of Prussia?
No questions.
Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
Uh-huh.
Say it. Do it. Now.
Hey, how's it going, man?
Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
Hello. Jim?
Alright. [leads Michael away]
Ryan? What does he know?
Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute���s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
Cri-Man-Squa?
I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ��� how do I put this ��� steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
[Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
Oh, great. He���s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
Let's do this thing.
I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now.  She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
That... that's impossible.
Put some ice on it.
[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
Impish or admirable.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
I heard you say ���well��� the first time.
There he is.
It���s a colloquial way of saying ���you���re fired,��� Kevin, which you are.
Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
And one girl push-up.
We?'
Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?
Not a word.
Oh!
MR. RYAN HOWARD!
Oh, they're forming an alliance
No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's]
Anything else you need to talk about?
Oh, I'm equipped... I can...
Maybe it's what she does here...
Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
Ooh, I love repartee.
Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
Mm-hm.
Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
[driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?
[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren���t going to look back.
I need to go over some details with you.
You've got to tell Andy about us.
Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office]
[mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.
Out of loyalty to this company...
I know. That���s not why I���m naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]
You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.
No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
[Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
Get in.
Yes, you do.
Office Depot!
In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
Major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative.
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane���s coming.  I suppose you���re going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
Wow--
Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
Hi Michael!
Look, I have no problem with women. It���s businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don���t lie about your shoulders!
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
Make a decision.
It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
Just wait and send it to voicemail.
I can���t even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
No, impish or admirable.
My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
More like, 'Aye, aye, General.'
Before taxes.
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ���em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
You haven't buried her yet?
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
You're back.
Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
She should thank me.
So excited.
Is this Jan?
Oh, really? Uh-huh.
I see Esther's back in town.
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!
...hollowed out, inside: waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question: did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
Ok, give that back to me.
My pants fell down! I don���t have a belt!
That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
Woo! Okay!
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
Andy! [Jim mimes basketball shot]
Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
Go back to the monkey!
In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I���m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there���s a mini-reunion. A kind of a ���where are they now��� panel at a local theatre. It���ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven���t seen Kevin since we let him go.
What is it?
Psh, why is that great?
It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
Wait, wait, wait.
It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
You.
Like an AIDS test?
You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
[whispering] Say you're sorry times infinity...
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
How is he gonna have grandkids?
[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?
���Gy-na��� said that?
It's not what you think.
[exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive.
Part of my job.
And who is this 'the' Steve Nash?
Eager.
Really?
Well something's come up, I have to go.
...confess to health care fraud.
Please tell me. I've been so good...
Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Why Jim?
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
What are some of your small business ideas?
Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
God!
[salutes] Thank you, Michael.
Aaaaaaaa!
What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
Nice.
There���s plenty. Don���t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Dwike?
Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
That's debatable.
Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
Right, standard.
Really?
Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
[scoffs] Like a gaggle of geese... [jibbering mockingly]
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
[sighs]
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.
Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
Why not call...
Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
Yes.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Awesome.
Thank you. I���m so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
Well, it doesn't...
So you'll be reporting to me, then.
We'll be here waiting for you.
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
Give me the hose!
Yes!
Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.
We had already applauded.
For reha-
You're the one who trained me, Michael.
[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.
Well...
I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
Movie idea?
[waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael's office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this?  Jan?
...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]
No. [typing on keyboard]
Yeah.
Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.
Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
[whispers] Don't let-shh!
Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.
I can't... [starts running]
Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
Good. They good?
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
Oh I did. I did.
I saw that. That's great!
If you say screw you one more time...
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
This is not Mega-Desk.
No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
You can't steal what is legally your property.
You are the future!
Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!
Nothing. [puts down binoculars]
Come on. Come on.
You know what you need? Closure.
In. I'm hungry.
I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
Kind of.
I'll have to talk to the manager.
Oh, God!
Yes!
Thirty-two meatballs.
[coughing]
[Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa....
Don���t be an idiot. It���s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you���ve been here. That���s the max.
Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Yes you did.
[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?
Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
[smiles knowingly]
Do you need anything?
Shh, shh, shh.
What?
Yes!
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
OK, I accept it.
To socialize.  And inform.
I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
Wh--
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
It's actually better this way.
Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
Yeah? Like what?
You can't just move out.
Done.
I will know.
Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying]
[Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
Very well, we will come back at 5:15.
Maybe if you listened a little bit, you���d improve. No wonder women despise you.
Oh, okay.
Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
I'm just...
No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
Where are you?
[on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman!
What?  No, this is about the right size.
Wow!
I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.
He turned over my...
Warf.
There you go!
Visual aids.
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
Next suggestion.
And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.
You seem a little nervous. You shouldn't be.
What Michael doesn't understand is that when I worked in the fast food industry I was actually commended by management for the three 'M's. McService, McCompetence and McPunctuality.
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
[moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention]
Cats don't make butter.
I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]
Stop forgetting things.
Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
[walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
Oh, how did that happen?
[quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]
Oh God.
Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Try me.
Get out of here moron! [Jim leaves]
Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
Disarm!
I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Troy!  What are you doing here?
Yes.
You'll have Pam to answer to.
Taste good too.
Mm-hmm.
[looking into his coffee mug] What the hell?
Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
Smart baby. That���s the most flavorful bond.
Are you going?
She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?
I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]
China is on the move?
Hey. Come on, buddy. Let���s do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don���t compare. When you���re with the R-O-L-F, you���re literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
YEAH!
I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
Know what?
[in disgust] Oh...
I do not look worried.
Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
If they're the worker bees, you're the Queen bee.
[walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.
I'm on it.
Hey, what was she like?
[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
What?
I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going ���please kitty, may I have some more?��� You can���t make this stuff up!
Oh give me a break.
What?
No, try me.
Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]
I won't.
Michael.
You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
Vamping.
Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]
Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
No. Jim, come on.
Pam?
Why's he talking to Holly?
Or get hit by a car-
I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
I'm kneading it!
What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?
No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
No, it was not!
How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm]
I was talking to myself.
On your marks, get set...
You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.
Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don���t quit your day job.
Oh, no, no. It's on the Miata.
Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
Uh, if they don't bobble, what's the point?
Yeah pretty much.
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
Wait, I see you every day. Can I say 'Good month?'
Does it have a deck?
I was right.
Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
Not��� significant is a big word���
I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
Really?
Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we���re about to do?
Ready?
Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate!
[whispering] You okay?
You know what?
It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Saturday.
[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]
Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
[continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
[whispers] Oh D.
When is the Paleolithic Age?
[entering office] What's going on?
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.
Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
You, you, you, you...
He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
Like this? Watch.
[in bullhorn] Pull over!
What if he's a murderer?
Michael, it's time.
Like in a cup?
But the little cars go in the compact spot!
And you are���
Yeah.
It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
David.
No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]
Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
Come on.
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then.'
Nine and three-quarters.
Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
OK, our prices have never been lower.
Ho, thirty years.
Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]
Five percent. No less.
Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
No, my groin...
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
What... [mumbling]
[box falls over] Oh.
He's heading downtown.
[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]
Oh, man, am I a woman?
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
I'm just saying...
Consider it?
[standing up] Get out.
Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
Roll in the hay, five dollars.
Is it called red-vining?
[eating banana] Mm, less than three.
[smirking] Oh, yeah.
Sounds fair to me, David.
Exactly.
Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late.
Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.
[Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, 'Kind of.'
[on the phone] Good. No, I completely understand, times are a little tight right now. If it's alright with you though, I will just give you a call back next month. Great, thank you so much. Goodbye.
Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.
[snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
[sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back!
I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
So, I'm paying full price?
Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
This is exciting! You���re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Mm, great cake.
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Your foot?
No. Let him get his own. It���s Syracuse money.
Oh, no.
[Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile���nod. Smile and nod.
Good.
Don't make me pre-fire you.
Thank you.
Dry rot?
[answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
Now, listen,...
I will stay here and run things on this end.
Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.
[frightened] Uh!
I gave her a higher clearance than you.
One word.
Michael...
Good morning temp.
No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?
Get...
Yep.
Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
Shut up.
Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.
Sorry.
But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
Ok
All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring.
I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
Oh my god.
[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
Get in!
They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier���s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
Keep them.
[looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one.
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They���ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ���em on in there.
Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing ��� bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You���re gonna love ���em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world���s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
Jim. Look I���m eating you.
What are you doing?
That���s right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
Wha...
[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
Oh my God, she told you?
Give me the punch card.
Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
I've said too much.
[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
Ah!
Ok, Pam, thanks.
Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.
It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let���s go!
Okay, how's that?
In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
It's called a costume.
Mr. Peanut is not classy.
Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute'
The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Sounds like a plan.
You know there's a ghost in this office
No? Then you are an idiot.
[fires tranquilizer gun twice]
Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
...'cause there's no comeback for that.
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
No.
Yes, please.
It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
Oh, tips are expected?
Good. Real good.
Hello.
Cool.
Yes.
The target-- it���s Oscar, isn���t it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
Walkie-talkies.
Did you do her?
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
Then looks like we have a deal��� Son [holds up a suit identical to his]
No.
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
That's a realistic time line.
I once saw a movie called 'Training Day'. It starred an African-American and Ethan Hawke. In it, the African-American trains Ethan Hawke with various tests and trials. Today, Ryan is Ethan Hawke, and I am the African-American.
Hungry?
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
[unimpressed] Really?
Where you come from, and who you are.
[whispering] But what if i'm hungry?
How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
[tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo!
Oscar...
Wait, shut up.
I've got a treat for you!
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door]
Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
Peepa, how is she?
Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
Ok.
[taps Jim's hand with his foot]
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
Oh, thank you.
Hey guys.
Judas.
Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
Okay, why are you calling Jo?
Please Michael, please.
[grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
It's close.
Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type: marsupial.
Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing 'Centerfold.'] They might be listening to us.
Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
Now, for the last time, I���d like a side salad with balsamic.
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
Gahh!
Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear]
I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
No. And the sheets are made of fire.
No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]
Good, excellent, and file sharing off and done. Security software, 128-bit encryption, firewalls. Get up, I'll install it on your computer.
No need to thank me.
[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it 'Hay Place'. Eldred Called it 'Hay World'. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.
We thought that she was you.
[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
Yeah.
Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
You're number four.
Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
[talking over Jim] Okay.
Okay.
So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
[takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!
You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
That's not true.
Believe it.
No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead.
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]
And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.
[scoffs] Vaccines are for chumps!
It just goes to show you, you play with fire and you are gonna singe your eyebrows. And they do not grow back the same way. [takes of glasses and points to right eyebrow]
So what do you want?
A bat! Impressive...
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
It is not a B and B.
Alright.
I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
It's only twenty-five bucks.
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
Here, here��� Just���
Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
I miss her so much.
Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
You promised us whales. These are worms.
Gosh. He he.
Just the one window?
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
Let me out.
Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
What are you writing about me?
OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
Well... it's my own fault.
Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
Excuse me?
Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
[looking up at Creed] Dad?
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
He says, 'No!' Boom!
Did you enjoy your lunch?
He doesn't even know that I do that.
Good. [Pam overhears]
Well played.
I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
The new guys called a sales meeting?
Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
Of course I saw it.
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
I asked you a question.
Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.
I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
Jim. I���m not kidding. I need you.
I want a truce.
Eat it!
MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
I just saved your life. You���re welcome!
Word.
Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?
I'll call you back.
Oui.
On his mother's grave.
Yeah!
Aah! Actually, he���s right in front of us.
Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.
I know.
Great idea.
Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
Blah.
[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
No.
Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]
You don't know what you need. Just...
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we���ve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
This expresses how loudly I love you.
[innocently] How'd that get there?
Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
I am a person.
[referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
Wake up! [Cathy screams]
Wow. So much crap. It���s just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor]
Oh...
When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person���s penis?
What?
Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
Thanks for meeting me.
Woohoo! Yes!
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
[scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
It's simpler this way.
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Michael-
[eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
Cell phone?  Charger?
[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
I have to see these shoes.
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
Yeah, but no one here has it.
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
I got it.
Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]
Let's go!
I hadn't noticed.
[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
All right, let's do this.
Just trying to be helpful.
I have to have an emergency crown put in.
Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
Whoa. Michael.
Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He���s got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I���ve got big expectations, Mose-wise.
Hey monkey, what's up?
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!
[typing] Okay, let me finish this thought.
Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]
Fumble! Yaaah!
If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
Oh.
[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
Well, because I want to know who wrote those diseases down.
I do not respect her, but I will go.
[squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
Let's go.
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
Alien
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
Come on.
I'm not gonna say it.
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
Awww!
Yeah. Well, I'd hate to see it blow up in your face.
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
[angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
Take me to his house.
[surprised] Ah!
I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
No.
You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
Pussy. Here, pussy. Pussy. Pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. Meow.
Hello.
Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
When no one hedded--
Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Are you enjoying your mineral water?
That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
No.
No.
No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
You mean, like a ham?
You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn���t you say?
Battlestar Galatica.
Well I'm not responsible for that!
Eh.
Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
I don't understand the reference.
With my leads and stuff like that?
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
Just admit you lost track of time.
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]
How dare you?
Let's go.
This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it���s not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It���s not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It���s for a disorder of the mind.
Got it.
What---
Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
In a way it���s like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they���ll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I���ll have a grandson.
I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Are you near sighted or far sighted?
Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
I have a smudge on my forehead?
Oh, it's so wet.
Power.
[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.
Oh, man. White people, right?
Angela, what about you?
You���re bad.
Poor little fella.
We did it!
How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
Don't be mad, it is a business trip.
It worked.
No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!
Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
Michael?
And you will be hearing from the -
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!
You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
Way to go man, Jan's really hot.'
All right, we're set.
No. [holds Sheriff's Department mug protectively]
No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
But we were gonna break the pig rib.
Please, have a seat. [Kevin sits down] Okay, why not?
Jim, move!
Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.
What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
That���s right Jim.
You and me, Michael. Yes!
Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
Hey, we nailed the sale!
[hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him]
Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!
No.
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
Ready?
No, it���s not. Here���s how we find out. Let���s line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let���s just size each other up here and left side of the list��� ATTACK!
OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager���s job?
It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
Damn it.
That's a ridiculous question.
Apology rejected.
You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
You can't.
Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.
In your office? [in Michael's office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
Living on a farm, your sense of smell gets very sharp. For example, there are beets in the condo two doors down that way. And someone over there, I believe, is a big fan of olives.
The perfect girl for me would be Konikotaka. She has the most amazing story. She was orphaned at age 10 when both her parents were assassinated, and she was taken in by a wealthy, but very cruel, businessman. So she practiced aikido in secret for years until she could avenge the death of her parents. She's also a survivor of monster rape.
Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
Hey, how's it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
[puts his grandmother���s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
No.
Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
Pull over!
He --
Okay.
She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.
Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.
Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Solitaire is a one-player game. It can't have two players.
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]
Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
I had a tickle in my throat.
I���d like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]
OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
Head towards the exits.
It's about this very announcement you just made.
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
Same thing.
No no no.
No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
[Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.
So, all the numbers adding up?
I checked it more than once.
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
Go. Get the door.
Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I���ll do mine���.. walnuts?
Happy birth moment, Michael.
[to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums]
Come up with a statement in the next hour....
But don't forget you owe me $10.
Gah! [tries to dislodge paper with his feet]
Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
I could never do that!
Care for a piece of chocolate?
I'll be back, I mean...
[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!
Do you want to do this right or not?
That was... unauthorized.
Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
No. Why not do it now?
So who are we laughing at?
What do you know?
Mmhmm.
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
What are you doing?
I've had intercourse in the office.
Ingredients.
[moans] Scranton rules! [sprays Silly Spray]
[singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.
Yes.
No.
Hola, tu es une buena worker?
Have a seat.
Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
Good morning, Michael.
Words will never be enough.
Just run! Take the stairs!
Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes.  Also.
Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]
Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
All right.
Really?
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
I have something to do.
[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
And who had your office?
Oh, don���t worry. They���ll get got.
[sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.
Ahh! OK!
Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
Yeah.
Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?
Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you���re in a suicide cult.
Pam is down for anything.
[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
No, I like Meredith.
Ahh!
Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
What does it say?
Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?
Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
None of your business.
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
He went over your head to go behind your back.
Thank you, Angela.
Would that make you happy?
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
Jim, Michael's office.
No!
Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
I am hardly the problem, Jim.
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]
��� 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up]
Oh, no. What?
[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
No thank you.
In your face!
Either he goes, or I go.
You can���t have someone murdered.
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
Cmon.
Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
Not true. And if they did, they couldn't because I'm password protected.
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus?
He's not kidding.
And 'Breaking Corporate News.'
Yes!
Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
Ow.
That doesn't make any sense.
So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
I need you to hose my aunt.
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Could be.
Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
[scores] Yes!
A few of the ground rules?
OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
It���s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
Ok. First impressions?
It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]
Oh. I got it.
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
Yeah.
Come on. Nice try, Josh!
Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
I am cool.
Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam's shoulders] You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
You know where it is. Lead me there.
I was wondering-
I've only had to use it once.
Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
Not a viable option.
[heated discussion in the 'Dwight Schrute Workspace', door opens] I did not dismiss you.
Good.
Welcome.
He is.
Wait, what girlfriend?
No, no, no, no! You don���t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There���s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don���t have diplomatic relations.
Hey!
Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
No thanks.
[laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh]
You're lying. We didn't win.
Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
They might be listening to us
Nice.
What's jazz hands?
[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
Damn It!
...never been lower!
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
How?
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
Good luck, Michael.
Right. Which one is that?
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It���s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I���d be happy to see Jim as manager.
Jim, are you serious?
I'm not good at jokes.
You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
Might get ugly.
Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
I���m gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where���s Stanley?
Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]
Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
No, [mumbling] I don't know.
I do.
Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
Psst.
Anything else?  Flint...
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]
Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.
It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
I love that show.
None of your business, Jim.
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
Right...
He hung up?
My eyes!
[trumpet sounds]
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
Oh, I like it.
Jim, get him a water.
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
No, it's... involves the photograph.
Tom?
Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
[sighs] You're an idiot.
Yes.
How did it go?
Jan, have you ever had deer?
It's a common question.
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good.
That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.
He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
Yes.
Made copies of it-
Oh, I'm OK.  I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
[heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!
Right. Highways or surface roads?
Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ��We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
Zeke.
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
Y el accento, donde are you from?
[mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
Great.
Nametag?
Clark has no chance. I mean, he���s up against my buddy Rolf, for God���s sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ��� he���ll make you laugh so hard, you���ll puke your pants.
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
Oh Pam.
The truth.
Wow! Lot of calories.
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
Uh, it's not totally empty.
[yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don���t try planking. It���s dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ���Specially with me around.
Oh D.
That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
Jeb, my brother.
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
[walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!
Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
Sensei, you���re not watching.
Normal. Ugly.
What box?!
You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'
[to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
Yup.
What?
What?
No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
I have.
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
It's only Meredith.
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
Hey monkey.
Fence with a hole in it..
Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
No thank you.
[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.
That's fair.
I can���t get it out. Try again!
All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
Yes.
I'm not.
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
No way.
None of your business.
It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.
Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
Like a wolf. Thank you.
I do, I have to go.
Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it.
You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
I have a girlfriend...
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ���
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
Alright, move it.
Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
[seething] Holly, you approved this?
I'll have Pam send out a memo.
Uhh-mmm [moaning]
Jan's here.
Good. [clears throat] So, am I a hunter gather culture?
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
No, I have not.
Knight Rider.
Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]
Okay.
All we can do is sit and wait.
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
Oh. God.
WE ARE WARRIORS!
Yes.
I know how we can learn his tricks.
No, we haven���t ordered anything. No one���s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
[fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
Right.
The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...
That is my idea.
I do. But you married my worst enemy.
Oh.
How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
No!
I like where you're going with this. Continue.
[laughs] Right? Come on!
Absolutely I would not.
I'm serious. What did you do to it?
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
No, you���ve been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
Okay!
Yeah?
Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
KGB.
Dammit, Phyllis!
Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
That's exactly the point.  You've hit a slump. It happens to the best of us.  You just have to remember, you know-
Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
Impossible, I love the law.
Well, I���ll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
Not my problem.
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
Sure.
Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
What's this?
Aww, Darryl.
Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
You don't like the Beatles?
Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I���m gonna like it.
Jim.
[as elevator door closes] Hold it!
OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
That's Andy Bernard.
This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.
What?
Eh, its not that early.
Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
Birthday hug!
My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?
Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let���s go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let���s go.
It���s a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we���re talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
I have to put you on with my boss.
No no no the first part.
Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
Are you serious?
Damn it!
[impatient sigh]
He wouldn't listen to me
Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.
Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]
It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
Super 8?
Pssh, stupid. Identity theft happens all the time. I can become you like that. [snaps fingers] But no one can become me.
Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
I can���t hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
Well rested.
[shouts from another room] What did you do?
Losers.
[on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?
I will trade you for the used candle.
I'm not a barbarian.
Stop ordering me around, Jim!
Give me the phone.
Okay, let's go.
You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
Come on Clark!
Cradle my head!
That is so cool.
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
Where's your tie?
Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Tape recorder.
Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
What about your party?
Correct.
My dream vacation?  I sleep in, putter around the farm, go fishing for a few hours, take a long run in the forest, check the traps.  Then the sun comes up and I head into work, which is empty, because everyone else is out of town on vacation.
In which direction?
It happens occasionally.
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
Come on old lady. Let's go.
[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
I want to do it.
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
Not my style.
Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
I'm sorry it makes me nervous.
What's so funny?
Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
Well, the alert was already set to ���Red��� because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to ���Double Red���?
Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.
But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
None of your business.
Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
That's an exaggeration.
What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
He even looks like a mole.
Observe. [walks towards desk]
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don���t see the point. It���s so Wall Street.
Coolio.
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
I would like to arrange a truce.
Got it. Go.
The democratic primaries,
I���m sorry. I���ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
Xterra's not even a real word.
On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]
... is there any news on the leads?
No.
Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself.
Very well.
This is not a test! Can you leave?!
[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk]
What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
I know. Evel Knievel.
I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?
[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don���t lie. I can tell if you���re lying.
No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
No need we can just check the security tapes.
Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
[walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim's pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim's voice] 'We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our...' [pauses recording] I've got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  I'm not insane. [starts the recording again] '...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.'
[struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?
Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.
Don't do it [lobs something at Michael]
Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don't hang up.
Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
[Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands]
Pam...
This is a bus transfer.
What? I believe it.
We better.
That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
It is the situation that we are in now.
We have... a bat... in the office.
Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
That suit is amazing.
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
All right. Sounds good.
What?
No way.
Let's go!
Yeah!
I put everything back in the vending machine.
And Dwight.
You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]
Good. Really really good.
Let's talk pubes, people.
No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.
Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
No, I insist.
It just doesn't add up.
K. I brought cheese too.
And then if I want...
And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
Don't lose your head.
It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
[fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they���re not even good. Really, they���re bad. Like you and your son.
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
It goes out automatically at five P.M.
I will never be your vichyssoise.
[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
You didn't have to...
[sighs] Now, how can I help you?
This ought to be good.
What is it?
Time for me to find out.
Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
Maybe you should.  Whatever.
No, Pam.
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
[smiling] No thank you.
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
That's not good.
Oh no! Jan!?  What's goin' on?
Yes... [whispers] I miss you.
Should I clean out my desk?
Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
All Right
...the fact...
Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
What?
You want me to flush him?
Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
Ready?!
[to old man] Okay, you're done.
Really?
Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
Michael, I would like to be the elf.
[as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Oh, this could be a juicy one.
Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
Ohhh, man!  [sound of Ryan throwing up] There it goes.
[scoffs] The boss isn't funny.
I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible 'Jim faces']
Think it through.
What are you doing?
OK.
Um.
It's gorgeous.  Let's go!
He doesn't like it.
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.
You work on commission, don't you?
Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?
Wow.
What?
I do!
Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
Okay, I will. Okay, fine. You'll be back.
This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
Why?
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
I date Indian girls.
[taking pen back] Gimme that.
Does Michael talk about
[singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
It���s him! Do something! Get out!
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'  Those are the money beets.
Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
[Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Zip your lid!
Describe it.
[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.
[on the phone] If I was offensive in any way, I...
I found it under the seat.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Deceit does not come easy to me.
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
We could do it in the warehouse.
Damn it!
Just a formality.
OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.
Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Michael!?
No, why were you in there?!
I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
What's this?
Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
That's what she said.
No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
I'm on it.
I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
Sly dog.
Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
Okay scram, wizard.
I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Me! Me, me, me.
Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
[Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody's found the hog maw.
[hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
You���re being disrespectful!
Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.
She's not here, Jim.
NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
Let���s get him inside.
Bildenkinder.
Hello.
Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
Fine.
Get in the car.
They match the carpet
[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
And you want me to come with you.
No trades.
Absolutely, I do. [giggles]
Good Morning!
I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
Let me see.
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
Hey... what are you guys doing?
I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
What is the capital of Maine?
Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
God... Damn it! Why us?
Why would Michael give you one before me?
Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
Uh, better ask Jim.
You have till five.
Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor���s had stolen from him?
He took my desk.
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That's it, the end.
[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
Yeah.
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
She said she was only sleeping with me.
Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Got it. [Andy's hand goes up]
Oh that���s real creative.
Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join]
Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
Where we going?
Huh? You like that?
That���s very true. Get the hell outta here.
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
No.
Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!
I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who.
Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]
Queen bee.
Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
I'm coming Michael!
Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I���ll be right back.
Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...' [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]
Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that���s great.
What do you mean?
He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
I might see a movie.
I'll make you two tapes.
Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go!
Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
Me.
Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part]
OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
Please sir! Spare him. Please.
Yes.
Yow!
Eighty thousand dollars a year.
Ah-luh-luh, a little comment.  Muh.
You���re not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
I deserve this. You know I do!
[picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.
Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.
Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
Would you like the stink sack?
No kidding.
I don���t like him either. ��And yet I really like him.
We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone]
Where are you taking the client list?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news���thing.
I knew it.
Him or me?
Cut.
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
What you doing?
How could it be more clear?
Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
Michael, can you explain?
Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!
Gimli.
Does it specify which windshield?
Come on in, the water���s fine.
Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
OK, what am I thinking right now?
Michael! My water's breaking!
Yes!
Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
[turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]
Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]
Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.
[exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
Con artist.
What did you do?
That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
No way. What if I meet someone?
Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim���s leg.
To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].
Always. [runs off]
Check it out.
[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
Will never be her name.
No.
Come on.
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
Daraas!  [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare���s milk?
What about Shoe La La?
Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
What the hell is this?
Boo, unimpressed. It���s a tightrope for babies. Boo!
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
Okay, now here���s the plan. I���m gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Am I nomadic?
No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
I'll order you some cranberry juice.
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
[laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes!
Okay.
A kick and a chop are two totally different things.
You think Jim���s lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.
Done.
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.
You'll fall in love with her.
Not counting the last one, 25.
Next suggestion.
[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.
Just rock. Shh.
Different guy.
All right.
Copy. Thank you.
Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?
I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Awesome!
So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
[agreeing with Shirley] Thank you.
There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
It smells like chicken soup.
Just for a minute.
We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa.
Yes.
Okay.
Two charges of loitering,
[as Jan leaves room] Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]
And, well, I don't see my co-workers--
What are you doing? Those are my keys.
Well, I'm not done yet.
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
Michael, it's Phyllis.
I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
Please?
Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.
I was just jogging.
Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
[laughs] With sex!
(takes out bag) 40. Always.
It's early bird gets the worm.
It does, but still no.
If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
I'm losing control of my bladder.
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!
Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
Yeah, Andy.
OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
That���s really rude.  I don���t tell you hurricanes suck even though it���s true.
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
Where are we going?
Jim, put those away.
Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
Oh my gosh.
Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
You're a secretary! What do you know?
Vegetarian?
Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
[singing]  ... Marilyn Monroe!
I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
What kind of mortgage did you get?
Right?
... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
[smiles] That's two things.
What do you have in mind?
Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Nice try. [on the phone] Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.
I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
Go. Push!
Yeah, right.
Very funny, Jim.
It's a divet...
I have an old barn!
Everybody! Hang on! [Dwight pulls out quickly]
Ahhh.  Mweehaa
You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
Damn straight.
Look what just arrived from the Nashua branch.  [reads from card attached to gift basket] 'Here's something to enjoy on your three non-vacation days.  Nashua branch.' Can I send them a dead deer?
Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room]
Wow. Did your baby draw that?
Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling]
Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
[on the phone] Excellent, good, good. Well, our truck is going out first thing tomorrow morning. So...
Winners!
Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]
Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
[climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!
The warmth will lure people inside.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
We all have a hero in our heart.
Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
[On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?
Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
Five minutes exactly.
[walks in dressed as Jim] Pam.
No, I didn't.
Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
Oh, yes, we do.
Uh, 24. 37.
We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package]
The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
So tape it down.
Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
[jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
Yeah!  Your idea.
The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? [Pretends to be on phone] ���Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt.��� It's that easy.
Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.
Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]
Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
Yeah, I hear that. You know what? This little baby might come in handy.
They are unrelated.
I'm busy.
I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!
No it is not.
Uh-huh.
None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?
Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn���t on the itinerary.
[exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
Oh, you wish.  Hellboy's a hero.
Please Ja, Ja... [Jan hangs up]
The temp.
Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]
Wait, so you���re the boss?
What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
Who is he saying?
Undistributable.
Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check��� on that later today. This is my grandmother���s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother���s buttock bullet ring.
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.
I need you to perform a test.
One minute ago.
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
[Dwight groans] Ugh.
Yes.
Okay, what's next?
Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
BAT!
It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]
Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
Friends with a hobbit.
Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
Hey.  No movement.
...is really tight.
Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
How you doing, Jordan?
Michael. Michael?
What are you doing?
That's impossible.
...from the 1930's...
Look at that one.
No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
I know.
That is a demerit.
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
I already made an appointment��� with your secretary.
Are you nuts?
Yes? What is the meaning of this?
Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. ���Scranton Mimeograph Corp?��� I don���t think we���re doing business with them any time soon. That���s odd. ��A letter from Robert Dunder. ���A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance.��� The Holy Grail.
Screwed.
Woo-hoo.
No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]
Perhaps.
It's true.
[out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
Do the monkey face!
All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.
Yeah, you know me.
Michael, I need to talk to you.
Hi, here you can have this. [Dwight gives Kelly his purse] It's a mini-briefcase, but you can use it as a purse.
[laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
Michael would never let me...
Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.
Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
Excellent.
I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
Uh huh.
[Mose drops cage and runs] Mose!
What is your name, sir?
Right.
Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
Pam!
Pam, hello.
No. [typing on keyboard]
Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]
Are those real pearls?
[on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that's my name.  See you soon.
Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
You���re really going to want the booster.
No! [waves arms] Pam, I'm over here!
It's a lullaby.
I know you did it!
I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
You never know. Better safe than sorry.
I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
Yeah. Well, have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable? 'Cause that guy couldn't get sick, just like me.
Thank you.
And action... Lights, camera, action. Whenever you're ready.
Wait, what?
You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
[to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]
Let me see your ID.
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say. That I'm not standing up for myself. But you know what? It's complicated and I really don't appreciate all the badgering.
I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file]  'Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.' Juvie. 'According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor...'  Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]
Do you love her?
[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves]
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
Very funny, Michael!
Wash your hands, Kevin.
Terrible!
Yes!
Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.
Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
[throws hard, Jim doesn���t catch] Nice catch.
How do you know it's going to be a boy?
Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
Wow. Late every day this week.
Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
Hey!
Yeah!
If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
Can I have an office?
Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
Yeah.
I am a Sheriff's Deputy.
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
There's a photo...
..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
[on the phone] ...crazy ways. I'm going to pass you off to my supervisor. Hold on one second. [whispering] Howard Gruber. It's Howard Gruber.
I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we���ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War���
What's going on in here?
[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I���m finished, it���s over.
There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]
Yes. Of course.
You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]
What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.
Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
I'm a huge fan.
I'm gonna with the python.
Sure.
Thank you.
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
What?
[kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
No. [takes a drink]
Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
OK, this is stupid.
Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
[picks up pencil between his toes]
So wait a minute, there's no drugs?
[exclaims] Atherozar!
Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
It's the ladies' room.
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]
By any means necessary?
Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!
Was she talkin' back?
[walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
[scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch]
What?
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.
Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
Eughh. [looks disgusted]
Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
I���m not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
Sorry.
[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
Ow! God!
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
I....
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Yes.
No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
Move it! One, two, three. [grunts]
Get in the van.
Answer me this, though.
I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.
Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
Ah, I'm not interested.
So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
Ok, what is going on here?
OK, everybody just calm down.
Jim!
[turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
Please.
No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
[scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
[removes glasses] I am the bait.
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We���re running late. Let���s get him inside.
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
Right?
It���s moments away. Just stay here!
Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]
Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.
Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
Clarice?
Okay. Fine.
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
This is stupid! Cut.
Yes!
Hey.
Which is you' is not a sentence.
[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
Shotgun!
Yeah, trust me.
May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
Everybody loves beets.
Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
Michael, nice tie or something.
Yes.
Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.
Okay.
No. That is not a toy.
You need to do something about your B.O.
Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.
It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
You!
[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Just a chocolate shake, chocolate sprinkles.
Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
Jim.
I chose my words very carefully.
Well, this is it.
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
Watch this part, okay?
Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
This isn���t gonna work out.
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?
[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
I'm pumped!
[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
Try 'Big Boobs' with a 'Z'.
No, you will be tested.
Great, right up there.
Master bee.
I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
It's time.
This is not a test! Move to the exits!
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
Need any help?
Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
You needed to speak to me?
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too 'meh' or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing 'I wear makeup'] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
[kicks the car] Unh! Scratch.
Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It���s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
I can try. I���m gonna use SMS text.
Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie���?  Lick the spoon?
Good night.
OK!
Try influenza.
You have information about the sex predator?
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
Seven? Can I finish please?
Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders.
No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.'
Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]
You know, you have worked so hard for this.  You are the boss; you can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger.
What?
Isn't that crazy? I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Lackawanna County says that it's okay for me to perform CPR, but for Michael my lips aren't qualified enough for his perfect little face. It's nuts.
I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]
Don���t!
That's where they remove the uterus.
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
[trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's 'Let's Get Physical' starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
Some of these people are for real.
[whispers] Yeah.
Thanks, Michael.
You are clean. Okay��� One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
Pam was supposed to get 'em.
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
Jonas.
Don't you dare! Andy!
That is so great about the bonus!
Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
Okay.
I sure do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
Oh, that's funny.
Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before.
Crowd control, directing traffic...
Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
Exactly.
No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
So what do we know about her?
Go ahead. Don't lie.
Yeah!
Into your-
I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.
That's what she said! [David laughs]
Yes?
Pushing on.
You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
Was that your per diem?
Yes, it is. Carry on.
I don't follow.
Inbwit? Yes.
Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
No thank you.
You know me.
No.
[lifts cup up with toes]
Excuse me sir.
[talking over Michael] Nice.
A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.
...their own children.
Listen to me! I love you! And I don���t care that Phillip���s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
[picks up his beeping cell phone]
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.
[looking pregnant] Hey Michael?
Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.
Okay, really?
I don't believe you. Continue.
We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
Yes.
Bet you I got mine for less than yours.
Come on, let���s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Well, don't look, freak!
[cries harder] Thank you, Michael.
Welcome.
Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh��� No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
Single... OK.
The White Pages.
I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
Hey buddy, what are you up to?
What? No way!
Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.
OK
Getting defensive?
I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
Nice to see you. May I hold him?
You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]
Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
You're good.
I'd think about it.
Yeah.
[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
Not doing that.
Smile!
Okay, listen. I���m kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I���ve never actually done this before.
Well, that depends on how old she is. What if your girlfriend is 55?
I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?
just drink a lot of water.
Very well.
Cause I could look it up real easily.
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
No.
This is Dunder Mifflin...
It is time to unveil the tree.
Your concern is noted.
I am trying to bring team spirit.
[Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]
Okay.
Michael is gone.
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-
Why just Michael?
And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.
Not what I asked.
Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
You came into my office voluntarily.
Oh.
Well, that didn't go well.
KGB.
We have more houses to visit.
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
Wow.
What's up-dog?
Oh, God.
Yes!
It'll all be goat.
Michael.
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
Look.  She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She's a bumpkin.  Pass.
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
No you're not.
I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.
Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees 'IT WAS DWIGHT' written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]
Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.
Oh, man!
Well don't look so surprised.
I will.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter]
Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
[throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
He'll die.
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
[off screen] What are you guys talking about?
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
...because you are never going to see him again.
No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
So what I���m hearing you say is, ���Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible���?
[to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
I'm only going to ask you this once. Are you part of an alliance?
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].
[coughs]
Yes! Ha!
[wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]
Prestige is ours. Okay, they���re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.
Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]
[at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side.
[looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
OK. [looks at watch and leaves]
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
[on the phone] Yes, Howard Gruber, please.
[to camera] Same thing.
Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
Come down right away!
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
[sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]
Shhh.  Don't be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle]  ...oh no.
Let's table that. So, temp... You seem to be pretty close to this Oscar.
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
My wound hasn't healed yet.
Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
[jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
Hello.
[laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
I can���t use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I���ll be launched into space. God, you���re so insensitive.
In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
No.
If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
Say no more.
Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!
OK.
I'm thirsty!
uhhhh....no one.
Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?
Uh, uh, not my problem. Okay, this is a paper factory not a bacteria factory.
GAH!!!
Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]
Yep.
Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
I'm fine, I'm totally fine.
Okay. [looks ashamed]
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
We'll see.
Emergency dentist appointment.
Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
It's just for family.
Take six.
I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
Hello.
You're doing the right thing. Go ahead. What 's your confession?
New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?
Gonna get it?
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
No! No!
Okay.
There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.
This is war and that is what happens.
Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
Yes.
Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
Yes, sir.
I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
What are you mumbling about?
In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam���s apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn���t see it, or didn���t wanna see it.
He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
None of your business. I'm writing something.
Let���s just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice]
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
[from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
[smiles]
Let's single...
Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
Angela, you're up.
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
[struggling] Ahh! I can't-
No, panic is warranted!
Fine.
Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...
Hoist his shank on three.
The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
How do I become a manger at Sabre?
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
Stupid.
Kelly is the only applicant.
Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
It���s a youtube thing! Let���s go. Let���s go. Come on, they���re coming.
The most important one of the guys.
Yeah. I can barely...
Bull... [bleep] [clears throat] Sorry.
She had a hysterectomy.
Do you accept?
We measured it once...
I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ���The Grass Roots��� in the 1960���s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
Move to the exits!
Ok
Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
How about Scrantonstrangler666.
Seven...
Let it out.
And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
You dressed exactly like the servants.
You really want Packer as your boss?
Yeah, and we���re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
[voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
Who's doing the presentations?
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you���re ever in the area, you���ll always have a place to stay���in my barn.
[hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Andy I���m really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]
[laughs] Nice.
Wait, it���s not D.M Utica, is it?
I don���t see it.
My eyes!
Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
You need-
Don���t move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]
Fifty L.
[stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!
[clears throat] 'I state my regret.'
No.  I think you should date Kelly.
They really do that.
Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
Got it?
Please, come back.
No doy!
Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
[imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls]
Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...
Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
You wanted to see me?
That's my client.
People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.
It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]
[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight]
Michael!  What's wrong?
Horse Boat.
David, is that you?
Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
That's what I said.
Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it���s literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]
Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Remember what we had Larry?
Mose, bags! Now!
No!
Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
Very smart.
[boastfully] Yes.
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...
Door. Chair. It���s about Phillip.
I could've gotten that, idiot!
[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
Mm, good stuff.
And he's lining it up. Seems pretty straightforward from here. If Michael Scott sinks it, he'll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods.
PETA.
And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]
Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
Say it again.
Anyone else?
Good.
Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
Oh, huggy hugs.
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning 'Love,' and adelph, meaning 'Adolf.' 'the city that loves Adolf.' Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
[whispering] I don���t know. I just don���t know.
Hold your breath.
Just now.
[clapping] Come on. Let's get back to this.
The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
We heard it was called red-vining.
As has Angela!
Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
You don't keep a diary.
One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
[on the phone]  Hey, what's up, kid?
DRAW SOME BLOOD!
You took that with you.
I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
I���ll stall him. Go!
Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that���s stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
Your path from obesity begins right here!
Come on, let's go. Take a seat.
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
Ok, tell him that's not true.
He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
Yes.
That place doesn���t exist. It���s not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
Oh... Narcolepsy.
You just said it. You just said it.
Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!'
I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
Stop it.
Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
That���s it.
What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
[to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.
[tries to climb human pyramid] Ahh!
There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
Has Michael checked in?
[into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
Three to four hours.
Yes!
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Where is Ryan?
[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
Rebel Yell, Billy Idol
Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
Thank you. [hangs up phone]
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
Thank you.
Please, I'll make you proud.
Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
Of course I checked it.
Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
[picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
Uhh.
Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
[applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Right?
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
Check out Dental?
Two forms of ID, please.
No.
Yes! Andy, get out here.
But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job.  Interested?
No. Angela! What are you saying?
No no no, I can't let you do this!
And you'll compare the times?
No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
[Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!
Whassup.
I hate her too.
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
Ok. Who reports to who?
Aah!
[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
[show her the wound] Oh God.
Who cares.
I think I saw it!
Based���on his merit.
No.
That's just a verb.
Schrute. Mister Schrute.
[whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
Yeah- oh!
You guys should use a hand truck.
Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?
I can tell. I won't let you down.
Thank you.
Getting a little something that calm the nerves?
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
The waitress tripped on the cord.
So tell me.
You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.
It's good to be paranoid. People need to be more paranoid. Case in point, JFK. If I had been JFK, I would have seen all three gunmen. I would have pulled out my concealed Luger and fired first. Man in book depository, BOOM!  Grassy knoll, BOOM! Fake Jackie, BOOM! [pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
Exactly. Yes.
I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
If you let me run it.
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Just for fun?
[sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]
Oh my God.
Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]
Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?
[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here���s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
So why is this on your resume? [door slams]
I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
That-
No. No.
Oh, man!
[to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Next to me?
Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
So what do you need me to do?
And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
I'll glance at it.
You okay, Robert?
Who is the king of England?
RAHHH!!!!!!!
This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it's handle] You sell a lot of these?
Thank you.
Inspiration.
That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
You're not on
Three.
Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
Mi-
[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
[over phone] Who is that monkey?
That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
Ok, I get it.
Hey, Toby.
Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
No.
Don't tell Michael...
Toby...
Go ahead.
I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]
Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
But I don't have any...
Ah.
[On Phone] One...
No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand]
I tell you what. You give me a tape of your band and a tape of the Steve Miller Band and I'll get back to you. That is all.
Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
[exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
[slams cell phone on desk] Argh! Ahh!!
No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
I don't want people making fun of my nose.
The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
[Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
Breathing. Is that you?
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Oh, that's perfect!
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
What a courageous venture.
A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
Good night.
[in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
What position did you use to conceive?
I call for a refold!
[scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
That's a very good record.
[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.
You'll see. Here we go.
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
Come on.
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
Yes, I do.
[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back.
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
[alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake.
Phyllis, no. No.
What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation.
What's your pin number?
Here we go. Make a wish.
Yeah, yeah!
We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]
Jim, not now! We need to cushion her head. Lie still. Please, Pam. Do not move.
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
In juvie.
[as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!
Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
Come here, I���ll show you.
Arr, dammit!  [throws saw at table he was working on]
There's no gum. There never was any gum.
[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
I smell mold.
I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
[to group] OK, let���s look at some ties.
Kevin! Do more stupid faces.
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
The book All The President's Men is about a conspiracy, just not the one people think.
I thought he was out on the road.
Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
Number one!!
I have crossbows.
[grunts] Let���s take him���
They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
Shunning resumed.
Damn.  [thinks]  I'll try Brookstone.
Dripping on me.
We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
Oh my goodness.
Yeah.
How do you spell 'animalian'?
My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!
Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
This is the lake!
That's fine.
I can't let you in, Michael.
Okay, okay. That's enough.
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
Oh no, no, no.
Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
Maybe you do. Hi. I���m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It���s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
What?
Every day is black tie optional!
From when he recommended me to replace him.
So what kind of commissions you get up there?
Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I���ve got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
What's this? What is this?
I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
No, please don't do this, monkey.
Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.
Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
Yeah, we���ll see about that.
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
You did this for me? [camera pans to 'Welcome Back Oscar' sign]
Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]
Sorry.
Let's get to it.
Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
I've got the key.
Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
Really? Oh... Then here we are.
Fine!
Really?
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]
The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]
Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose]
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
Do I live near a harbor or an ocean?
I could, but I just don���t feel like it loser.
You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name.' You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
You took something that doesn't belong to you.
Hello.
Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.
Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
I have two. White and Indian.
Yeah.
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
[Holds his finger to Jim's lips] Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim]
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
That shady grove out by Willard's pond.
[on telephone] Good. Excellent. Thank you.
Rule 17: don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound]
Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
Who's the target?
Told you.
What?
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
So who will be your new Number Three?
What?
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
That was the last signature I needed.
You said you didn't know how to say it.
No, not me.
Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?
Are you socialist?
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.
Can I be team manager?
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
Uh. [eats antacids]
He's gonna love it!
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
Hmm.
Who are you?
That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
With the crotch.
Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
What?
Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]
What do you think?
Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ��� What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
What is this?
No! No, no! [groans]
I'm breathing heavily.
And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.
Hello, Jan.
Two at a time!
Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.
[shuts door on him] Great.
Henrietta.
Burgers.
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of 'Oklahoma' in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.
[whispering] Michael.
You have it?
I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
Okay. Come on! Jim!
[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
Mm-hmm.
Yup?
Push!
Okay! Come on!
Look, we're twins.
Downsizing?
Same thing.
Why don't you just buy the whole song?
Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
No, but we should discuss that another time.
oh���
Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Okay, here���s one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can���t rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
Lunch.
It's about Michael.
[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
OK.
Please.
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
I'm cashing in the favor.  Fire him.
[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?
Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?
We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
Really, that's your real name?
That would have been really embarrassing.
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
Don't want it.
Andy.
Dale Raymond Corson!
[applause] Yes! Thank you!
I'm sorry, Michael
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]
The buyer is your sister���s friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that���s an order.
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
I'm great. How are you?
Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.
No. You will not.
Oh, you get kicked.
[sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Who's the father?
[enters quickly] You need my pitchfork?
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
They're still good for another week.
It's a miracle.
No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
It���s 15 feet down, it���s at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it���s like your catching a medicine���
[creepy smile]
Clown paint.
What?
Wolves.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.
So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
Ugh.
Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
Bring it.
Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
Hey, hey.
Jim! Open the door!
Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
You have never been cooler.
Ah! Not so fast.
Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah!
[pantless] OK, how is my voice now?
Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that���s what working at a paper company���s all about!
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
But as Jim and I discovered...  No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I���m telling you... if you don���t do this, [whispers] I don���t stand a chance. Please, Jim.
Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
Let's go.
So long Donna! [Michael hangs up]
It's my car now.
Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you���re engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
An ���X.���
I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
...and then we compare notes.
Yes, Michael.
There it is. [everyone applauds]
I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
You heard me!
D-W-I-G-H-T.
Shhh, Pam. C���mon, don���t be such a right-sider.
He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]
There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
Go put them all in random order.
People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
What's our presentation about?
So I can lower it.
Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!
Yes.
Oh, yeah. Yes!
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
Merry Christmas. Good.
I'm stronger.
Oh, hey, I���ll take a coffee.
Coopers has calamari.
The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
Nice, very nice.
That's good, let's wrap it up.
Thank you.
Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
Oh good. She broke up with you.
Wow, that���s great. That���s great. Ok, good, let���s talk about that, ok?
Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
Our theme, if you will.
Do you have your money belt?
I understand. It's in a blind spot because I'm trained in several martial arts and one of them, uh, includes, uh, an awareness that the masters bring, uh, of anything on all sides of you. It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but... Documentary Crew Member: [talking over Dwight] It's...
What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It���s called ���Schrute or Consequences.��� You���re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
It's about adapting to the circumstances.
Well, it���s a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
What?
Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
Yes, Sensei!
I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]
Um, these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years.
[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]
[interrupting] ��� lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
That's where they remove the uterus.
I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
[to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
Yeah.
[to Packer] Silence.
What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
Ok, Um... The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the 'trappings' of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
[chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
I have no idea.
Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
I'm the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!
I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
Yeah.
We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
And wake up in the future.
Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.'
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
Not yet.
[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please.
Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
Yes.
Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.
Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here.
Danny Cordray is the worst.
I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
Screwgun. The sales call!
I am not.
I sa- [Andy honks his horn]
Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'
With all my heart.
Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
Here's another place.
Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?
Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
Of course.
Blood, urine, or semen.
Step lively. Single file everybody.
Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
You are an impressive specimen.
Hey, it just takes one!
[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You���re a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark���s shoulder]
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.'
This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
I got sofa. I got sofa.
Don't say cow- Ugh.
Yes, Monkey.
Michael.
Oh man,
What? No, but I --
[sighs] Please? Please?
The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
Unlikely.
[raises hand] Here.
The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There���s a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing ���the White Whale���. Look at all that sweet blubber.
I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
She's only a cat.
Don't be an idiot.' Changed my life.
Stanley! Wake up! You���ve got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
That���s right. Will you just give us a second?
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
I���m trying to make him feel important.
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
It���s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I���d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
I don't think so, no.
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Me too. [smirking]
Watch this.
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
Thank God.
Stupid!
Mm-hmm.
[riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
Who, me?
(smirking) Exactly.
[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
Wait, canine AIDS?
About what?
That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
Hee-heeding this right now.
I can save the branch.
I was born a man, Halpert.
Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
I...
���Sedes introiti.��� Seat of entrance.
Are you kidding me?
Don't make me do this the hard way.
Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo!
[scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet]
He���s like a manatee. Ready? Let���s go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley���s head hits the door frame] Oh, God.�� No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
Not Dwight.
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
[screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I���ve ever made.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
Quiet you.
I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
[clears throat] Knock, knock.
Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
Excuse me, Goldschlager, extra flakes.
I'm gonna take you home Michael.
[whispering] You set a date?
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Angry.
I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
Bring him the gabba-gool!
Did you do her?
It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Yes. Anything.
Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
Not like this.
The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
Yes, of course it does.
[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
Yeah.
This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
Answer me.
If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
Aaah!
Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
Okay, I'm on it!
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You���re still at the 570 number?
Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
Ok, ok.
Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
You have to interview me...
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It���s gonna be fine. It���s gonna be fine. There���s plenty of Pyramids.
Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
Get out of my way. Huh!
What the? [follows Nellie into the break room]
What?
Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
Aaaaaaaa!
Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
[whispering] You're gonna blow it.
Hey stranger.
Michael? Please! Come on!
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
I bet she had hairy armpits.
Oh, come on. I���ve never heard of such a thing.
The Dundies!
Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
Michael?
Well, we���re both just kinda learning as we go, aren���t we?
Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What���s going on Nellie? Talk to me.
Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?
Oh, that's funny.  MICHAEL!
Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
Don't sleep with your boss.' Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
What's with the smile?
Pam.
Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.
You speak English?
Jan Levinson-Gould.
Then make him pitch to you.
Michael, we have a situation.
Limbo, whoo!
Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
Very good.
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Motel 6? Best Western?
[Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
