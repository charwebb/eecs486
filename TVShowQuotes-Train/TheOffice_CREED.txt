Yep. That's exactly what happened.
Not cool man. [walks out]
It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy.  When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
Ed was decapitated.
Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
Thanks.
She's crazy hot.
The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...
[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over.  It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.
Oh, he does. He does.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.
Ah, Hillary Swank.
Want to play a game?
Ugh.
No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.
Let's fight it.
That's not why.
I gave Toby my buddy Jorge's number in Costa.  He'll hook Toby up with everything: cable TV, women, oh, and this amazing coffee to snort.
I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the '70s.
So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
Remember, you���re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I've been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.
[over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed.
I don't know. It was so long ago.
I don't know.
Undo it!
All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
Good work, kid.
Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
I'm really hating this Jim guy!
We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?
Thank you very much.
Sure.  He hired me.  How's he doing?
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
[from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]
[shaking Holly's hand] The pleasure's all mine.
Oh, no. I need the money.
Give it up, he's dead.
I thought you were gay.
Cambodia.  You?
I'd send you to Hong Kong.
I don't know what to tell you.
[running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
In a way you did.
It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]
I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair...
I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today.
All right.
[after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?
Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
No, no. I had some, thanks.
I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
Your shower radio.
The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
That's from me.
[still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
Ditto that, my brother.
No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
What?
Kids, kids, kids, slow down.
[takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
On the go that's after three.
She's looking good.
Creed! Ha!
Here.
: I'm not offended by homosexuality.  In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain.  And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.
Yes.
I think you two should meet.
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
That is correct.
[talking through bullhorn] Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I've seen this too many times.
Any time.
I really appreciate it, Boss.
I thought you might.
Ah, it's all starting to make sense now.
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
It's a real shame about Ed, huh?
He don't give an 'F' about nothin'!
Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.
Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
Oh, oh that's right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].
I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.
I hate devils food.
When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
Yes, hello.  Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there.  And I'm trying to remember who it was.  Mm-hmm.  Who wasn't there last week?  Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.
Let's put a smile on that face!
I want to sell your blood!
Hell of an ass.
Good night, Mary Beth!
No, you have the power to undo it.
No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.
No.
[walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
Listen, I've got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
Fifteen years, I think.
Sure.
Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
Hi guys.  Somebody makin' soup?
When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I���m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
[opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It's a photo of all of us.
[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office]  Sorry I'm late, boss.  What's going on?
Yes, sir.
Ryan!
I don't know, man. I just don't know.
[on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?
Challenge.
Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
Touch me and I'll sue.
And a happy holiday to you.
[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
I don't think I'm there yet, Boss.
A wheel wants to spin, Pam.
It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But���[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let���s do this.
I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.
Ah, Dwell.
Suit yourself.  But, if it were me, Botox [points at Oscar], wig [points at Kevin].
No, I wanna stay here.
Well, I really, really, really liked it.
Goodnight Mary-Beth.
Us? You and me. The old timers.
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She's got some children.
[bleep] you! [bleep] you! God!
Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
Night
I'm out.
Yep.
Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
How far along?
You want some?
I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
I don't know. I got nephews.
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
What, is any of this real?
Yeah. [Jim enters room]
Let me have a turn.
Hey, why haven't we ever, um...
[spying on David and Jim] They've been in there a while.
Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here?
They make a nice couple.
Everything's cool, dude.
That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
I do not.
You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
I am indeed. How'd you know that?
Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
That's kinda uncool, man.
I can bring these to my shelter.
No...
[from desk chair] Oh, come on!
Think they're talking about me?
[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
Can I go?
Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
I...
Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
This gal, she's really into you?
I'm just looking.
I miss Clinton.
Mm-hmm.
$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
The tall guy got engaged.
She's messed up man...
What are you telling me?
I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30.  Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what.  I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that.  So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels.  Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
Let's do this thing. [Creed loses the first point, tosses his paddle on the table and starts taking off his shirt.  Jim retrieves the ball and looks back to see Creed with his shirt untucked and unbuttoned]
[hums]
I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat.
[opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go.
It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
Who's the OB/GYN?
You think?
Because they're lame.
Yes, sir.
[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
I can get you one in an hour.
[Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me?
[to Oscar] Who do you think did it?
Come on, boss.
This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
Okay.
Four nights a week, I sleep under my desk, and then three nights I stay at my place in Toronto. They don't know about this job up there. It's a welfare state. Beautiful countries, both of 'em.
Let���s try it out.
The real question here is who's this guy work for?
Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.
We should start our own mall!
My tombstone's already made, thank you.
No. No. No. You���re way off on that one.
The balls on you, man.
I'm having a little trouble motivating.
[receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
[notices something new about Dwight] New glasses.
[looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
I don't care which party I go to. Once you've danced naked at a hash bonfire with the spirits of the dead, all parties seem pretty much the same.
Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant.
I hear it, too, Boss.
If that's flashing, then lock me up.
How'd I get this long triangle?
Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
Hi kids.
Who has AIDS?
We're screwed.
[sighs] Thank God.
Great. [gets up and leaves]
Oh ho!  Which one is Pam?
Jinx. Buy me some Coke.
Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? [playing well]
Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael.
No.
Michael, undo it!
I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank.  He's a mole person.
Whacky-weed Creed.
Yeah.  That's what she said.
OK. Hang on just a second.  Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.
That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!
My wife���s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
I've done some things I'm not proud of.  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago.  Princess Cruise Lines.
He has no wallet, I checked.
It's Kismet!
Have you tried making everything smaller?
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.
I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless.
You did good. You did good.
[to Rose] You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
Wesley Silver���s gay?
Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
Just boardin', you know how we do. [flips skateboard up]
Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...
Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage.
I understand it, I can't speak it.
I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.
All right.
When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
Hey! What are you guys doing here?
You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
Oh my goodness.
Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
82 November first. How much is the prize money?
[Dwight pulls over to pick up hitchhiker] Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
Did he actually give you some ganja?
Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
Beleniege!
Hi, hello.
Have fun!  [sigh]
Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
Hey!
Creed Bratton, 75 plus division.
Mmmhm.
I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
All right, thank you, bye-bye.
You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up 'get out of jail free' cards, those things cost thousands.
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
[on phone] Daat!
Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura Show.
Okay, you take it easy, ace.
Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
I���m sure it���ll turn up.
Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
Yeah, that's all-inclusive.
To look younger, so the kid doesn't replace you with machines.
Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry.  We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
What if you've been bad?
I did it!
Did you start the paperwork yet?
Okay, okay. [gasping]
It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu.  I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?
In a minute.
I heard that from... Andy.
Fright. Being scared to death.
Exactly.
I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]
That wasn't a tapeworm.
[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
What size?
Hey, boss, did you find Nemo?
What did I say?
We're working. [Jim still holding his breath]
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
No, but I still have my medal from that.
There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?
Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.
[Bluetooth rings] You got Creed.
Really?  I thought you. [both laugh in Michael's earshot]
I want a nice cobbler.
You ever notice you can ooze two things: sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.
He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6.  He slides under an 18 wheeler.  Pop.  It snaps right off.
Get her Phyll.
That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?
That's crazy. It's crazy.
You don't want to do that.
...Excuse me.
Cool beans.
Well nobody's touching my cobbler.
I want pie. I want peach pie.
HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow!
Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
I saw the leaves twitch!
Well, draw me a map, mama.
Bald people make me sick.
Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
[playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn���t matter. ���Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same���
You shut up!
[motions to phyllis's desk]
Okay.
Oh. [laughs]
The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes...
Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work.
Pam, this is important. Was he me? Am I him?
I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It's tragic.  Just tragic.
What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. 'What do I do?'... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. 'Qua' something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.
I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
Tapas swiss miss.
I'm not good with names.
What's a text?
Oh... Where did you get this stuff?
Which aisle?
I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.
Here's the $40 you gave me.
We're not playing strip pong? [Jim shakes his head no]  Okay. [Creed picks up paddle]
[walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week.
Yeah.
[singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
We hate Pam. We hate Pam.
Well, I can't, I don't know how.
Oh nothing.
Hank, his name is Hank.
Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
You don't have to do this, Michael.
Back in the '60s, I was with the Grass Roots. We toured with Janis Joplin, The Doors, Cream. We had a lot of fun, And now I do quality assurance for a paper company. As you can imagine, drugs played a part. They still do. My work calls last about 90 seconds, and that's about as long as I can concentrate.
You are welcome.
Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?
A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]
How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good.
Hey!
About what?
Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
I don't know, let's try.
I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.
You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
[drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
Hey, Angela's back with her baby.
She's one sassy black lady.
It's thrilling.
Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
I'll wait. [sighs]
What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
Bonnie Hunt is on.
You know, guys, Michael has really incredible decision-making abilities. Michael's really incredible at making decisions.
Right place at the right time.
Thanks mom.
Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
Pirate code, he wants to meet.
[pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first 'B' stand for?
If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor���s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed���s head] Oh!
Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
Th-the hair covers it, mostly.
He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
Oh, thanks ese.  So, what are you guys doing?
Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo.
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
[approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.
What?
In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
Something's up.  That paper was never supposed to arrive.
