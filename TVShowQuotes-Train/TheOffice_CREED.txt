He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
I can get you one in an hour.
Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
I don't know. It was so long ago.
Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here?
[to Oscar] Who do you think did it?
[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.
That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
One year, I had a close acquaintance of mine back a truck in here and clean out this whole place. That was a very good year. I think they blamed it on some kid.
In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.
Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
I've done some things I'm not proud of.  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago.  Princess Cruise Lines.
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
[drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The 'O'...
[running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But���[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let���s do this.
You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'
[playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn���t matter. ���Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same���
Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor���s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed���s head] Oh!
I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
My wife���s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
[Dwight pulls over to pick up hitchhiker] Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
[approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.
Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
[walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.
[still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30.  Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what.  I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that.  So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels.  Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
[looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?
No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
[feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents.
I don't know, man. I just don't know.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.
Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.
[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.
I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.
Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.
I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? [playing well]
It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]
Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
I gave Toby my buddy Jorge's number in Costa.  He'll hook Toby up with everything: cable TV, women, oh, and this amazing coffee to snort.
[after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?
How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good.
What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.
Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry.  We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
To look younger, so the kid doesn't replace you with machines.
It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
Really?  I thought you. [both laugh in Michael's earshot]
About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I've been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
[spying on David and Jim] They've been in there a while.
Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
[singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...
No. No. No. You���re way off on that one.
[from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]
82 November first. How much is the prize money?
[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.
Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
Pam, this is important. Was he me? Am I him?
Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy.  When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
Oh, oh that's right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].
Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?
Something's up.  That paper was never supposed to arrive.
I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
OK. Hang on just a second.  Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
[singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
Four nights a week, I sleep under my desk, and then three nights I stay at my place in Toronto. They don't know about this job up there. It's a welfare state. Beautiful countries, both of 'em.
[takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
Listen, I've got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office]  Sorry I'm late, boss.  What's going on?
I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.
Back in the '60s, I was with the Grass Roots. We toured with Janis Joplin, The Doors, Cream. We had a lot of fun, And now I do quality assurance for a paper company. As you can imagine, drugs played a part. They still do. My work calls last about 90 seconds, and that's about as long as I can concentrate.
Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant.
Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
[receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
[Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me?
I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6.  He slides under an 18 wheeler.  Pop.  It snaps right off.
[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I���m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
The real question here is who's this guy work for?
Hello. [Jim replaces Creed's apple with a potato][Creed takes a bite of the potato]
Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu.  I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
Let's do this thing. [Creed loses the first point, tosses his paddle on the table and starts taking off his shirt.  Jim retrieves the ball and looks back to see Creed with his shirt untucked and unbuttoned]
What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. 'What do I do?'... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. 'Qua' something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She's got some children.
[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over.  It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.
Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?
Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.
I don't care which party I go to. Once you've danced naked at a hash bonfire with the spirits of the dead, all parties seem pretty much the same.
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...
The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.
Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
[pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first 'B' stand for?
Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
[on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...
[opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go.
Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
: I'm not offended by homosexuality.  In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain.  And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.
Just boardin', you know how we do. [flips skateboard up]
Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
Oh, thanks ese.  So, what are you guys doing?
I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank.  He's a mole person.
I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
No, but I still have my medal from that.
The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.
Remember, you���re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It's tragic.  Just tragic.
Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the '70s.
[to Rose] You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
It���s Halloween. That is really, really good timing.
[walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week.
Ah, it's all starting to make sense now.
Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?
No, you have the power to undo it.
The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
