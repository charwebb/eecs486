I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.
[Dwight pulls over to pick up hitchhiker] Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
Something's up.  That paper was never supposed to arrive.
I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The 'O'...
[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
[after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?
Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
The real question here is who's this guy work for?
I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
Back in the '60s, I was with the Grass Roots. We toured with Janis Joplin, The Doors, Cream. We had a lot of fun, And now I do quality assurance for a paper company. As you can imagine, drugs played a part. They still do. My work calls last about 90 seconds, and that's about as long as I can concentrate.
Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless.
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat.
Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
I can get you one in an hour.
Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry.  We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
Suit yourself.  But, if it were me, Botox [points at Oscar], wig [points at Kevin].
Remember, you���re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'
[playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn���t matter. ���Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same���
It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But���[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let���s do this.
Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
Let's do this thing. [Creed loses the first point, tosses his paddle on the table and starts taking off his shirt.  Jim retrieves the ball and looks back to see Creed with his shirt untucked and unbuttoned]
I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]
I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30.  Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what.  I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that.  So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels.  Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...
Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
No, but I still have my medal from that.
It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]
I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.
Listen, I've got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office]  Sorry I'm late, boss.  What's going on?
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...
So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank.  He's a mole person.
Ah, it's all starting to make sense now.
I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.
[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I���m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
[opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It's a photo of all of us.
[from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]
[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It's tragic.  Just tragic.
That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?
You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
Four nights a week, I sleep under my desk, and then three nights I stay at my place in Toronto. They don't know about this job up there. It's a welfare state. Beautiful countries, both of 'em.
Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good.
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.
Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.
I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the '70s.
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
It���s Halloween. That is really, really good timing.
Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
82 November first. How much is the prize money?
[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.
Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
[talking through bullhorn] Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I've seen this too many times.
[walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
Oh, thanks ese.  So, what are you guys doing?
My wife���s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
[singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...
[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.
I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
Really?  I thought you. [both laugh in Michael's earshot]
You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up 'get out of jail free' cards, those things cost thousands.
Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
I've done some things I'm not proud of.  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago.  Princess Cruise Lines.
[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
[receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant.
I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
[drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.
Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6.  He slides under an 18 wheeler.  Pop.  It snaps right off.
[walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week.
Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over.  It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage.
I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.
: I'm not offended by homosexuality.  In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain.  And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.
Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.
Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
Pam, this is important. Was he me? Am I him?
Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.
Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
[opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go.
One year, I had a close acquaintance of mine back a truck in here and clean out this whole place. That was a very good year. I think they blamed it on some kid.
Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?
When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.
Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
[Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me?
Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
[spying on David and Jim] They've been in there a while.
[looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
[pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first 'B' stand for?
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
I don't know. It was so long ago.
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]
Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor���s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed���s head] Oh!
This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
Yes, hello.  Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there.  And I'm trying to remember who it was.  Mm-hmm.  Who wasn't there last week?  Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She's got some children.
Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
[running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.
[holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
[takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
[singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today.
Just boardin', you know how we do. [flips skateboard up]
No, you have the power to undo it.
Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?
Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here?
So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.
Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu.  I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
No. No. No. You���re way off on that one.
Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.
Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I've been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.
The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
I don't know, man. I just don't know.
If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy.  When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
Oh, oh that's right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].
I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? [playing well]
We're not playing strip pong? [Jim shakes his head no]  Okay. [Creed picks up paddle]
[feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents.
Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
I gave Toby my buddy Jorge's number in Costa.  He'll hook Toby up with everything: cable TV, women, oh, and this amazing coffee to snort.
I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
