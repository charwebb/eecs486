Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
[motions to phyllis's desk]
Get her Phyll.
The balls on you, man.
You don't have to do this, Michael.
Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu.  I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
He has no wallet, I checked.
Animals can't feel pain.
Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
[opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go.
Well, I can't, I don't know how.
Here's the $40 you gave me.
Night
That's crazy. It's crazy.
[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I���m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
You shut up!
A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
[sighs] Thank God.
Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
It���s Halloween. That is really, really good timing.
She's messed up man...
I think you two should meet.
Let's fight it.
Let's put a smile on that face!
[singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
I'd like to contribute.
Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
Your shower radio.
What?
And a happy holiday to you.
[spying on David and Jim] They've been in there a while.
Want to play a game?
Hey, boss, did you find Nemo?
We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?
What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
Oh ho!  Which one is Pam?
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
Yeah, that's all-inclusive.
HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow!
Thanks.
Exactly.
Okay. What about your friend?
Whacky-weed Creed.
Oh my goodness.
No, you have the power to undo it.
[receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
I heard that from... Andy.
It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo.
[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...
I've done some things I'm not proud of.  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago.  Princess Cruise Lines.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.
Okay, you take it easy, ace.
Me neither.
Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes...
: I'm not offended by homosexuality.  In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain.  And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.
I want pie. I want peach pie.
I know you don���t really exist.
Creed! Ha!
Four nights a week, I sleep under my desk, and then three nights I stay at my place in Toronto. They don't know about this job up there. It's a welfare state. Beautiful countries, both of 'em.
It's not cool.
[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
No. No. No. You���re way off on that one.
Sure.  He hired me.  How's he doing?
Th-the hair covers it, mostly.
Who said that?
He don't give an 'F' about nothin'!
So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
Just boardin', you know how we do. [flips skateboard up]
Have you tried making everything smaller?
All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
The feeling of pure risk.
I'm not good with names.
I watch you when you sleep.
I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.
How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good.
Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
I understand it, I can't speak it.
[singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...
No...
Everything's cool, dude.
[walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
I don't care which party I go to. Once you've danced naked at a hash bonfire with the spirits of the dead, all parties seem pretty much the same.
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.
Good night, Mary Beth!
We're working. [Jim still holding his breath]
Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
Sup? [rolls into kitchen on a skateboard]
Ryan!
I still have my medal from that.
I don't know. I got nephews.
[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office]  Sorry I'm late, boss.  What's going on?
You don't want to do that.
Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
Sure.
Hi, hello.
Yep.
[feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents.
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
[to Rose] You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
Pam, this is important. Was he me? Am I him?
I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
I thought you might.
Oh... Where did you get this stuff?
Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? [playing well]
[walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week.
OK. Hang on just a second.  Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
My wife���s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
Because they're lame.
The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.
What if you've been bad?
You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage.
Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
I'm just looking.
Here.
Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.
Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...
All right, thank you, bye-bye.
Goodnight Mary-Beth.
You're welcome.
I'll wait. [sighs]
[running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
Beleniege!
Ah, it's all starting to make sense now.
Creed Bratton, 75 plus division.
Hi kids.
I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry.  We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
Right place at the right time.
He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
[looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
Let���s try it out.
I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Wesley Silver���s gay?
Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.
Pirate code, he wants to meet.
Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
Cambodia.  You?
Yeah.
You ever notice you can ooze two things: sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.
What did I say?
There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?
They make a nice couple.
$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?
Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
What are you telling me?
What, is any of this real?
You think?
Can't be good.
Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
I can get you one in an hour.
[from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]
Thank you very much.
That is correct.
It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But���[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let���s do this.
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
[pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first 'B' stand for?
Yes.
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She's got some children.
Hey, Angela's back with her baby.
Hey!
Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?
Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?
Yes, sir.
Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today.
You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael.
I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.
[Dwight pulls over to pick up hitchhiker] Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
Ditto that, my brother.
What size?
Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.
She's looking good.
In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
Oh nothing.
You are welcome.
...Excuse me.
I'd send you to Hong Kong.
I���m sure it���ll turn up.
[hums]
I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It's tragic.  Just tragic.
Remember, you���re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
Yes, sir.
I really appreciate it, Boss.
No, but I still have my medal from that.
[from desk chair] Oh, come on!
Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.
It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!
Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
Hank, his name is Hank.
Come on, boss.
Let me have a turn.
I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank.  He's a mole person.
Bonnie Hunt is on.
Oh, thanks ese.  So, what are you guys doing?
I don't know what to tell you.
You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.
I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat.
[approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.
Kids, kids, kids, slow down.
If that's flashing, then lock me up.
I gave Toby my buddy Jorge's number in Costa.  He'll hook Toby up with everything: cable TV, women, oh, and this amazing coffee to snort.
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
All right.
www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
[still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
That's from me.
Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
Us? You and me. The old timers.
Oh. [laughs]
[over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed.
Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
We should start our own mall!
I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
I am indeed. How'd you know that?
[opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It's a photo of all of us.
Just doing my job, guys.
I don't think I'm there yet, Boss.
To look younger, so the kid doesn't replace you with machines.
That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?
She's crazy hot.
Not cool man. [walks out]
I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair...
Which aisle?
Ok, thirty seconds to showtime!
I do not.
I...
Ah, Dwell.
Mm-hmm.
It's Kismet!
Yep. That's exactly what happened.
Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor���s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed���s head] Oh!
Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy.  When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
Hey, why haven't we ever, um...
This gal, she's really into you?
[on phone] Daat!
Ed was decapitated.
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here?
Fifteen years, I think.
I want a nice cobbler.
I don't know, let's try.
No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.
Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
Who has AIDS?
Yes, hello.  Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there.  And I'm trying to remember who it was.  Mm-hmm.  Who wasn't there last week?  Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.
Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.
Suit yourself.  But, if it were me, Botox [points at Oscar], wig [points at Kevin].
That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Yeah, you.
Jinx. Buy me some Coke.
I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over.  It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.
[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.
Fright. Being scared to death.
I can bring these to my shelter.
On the go that's after three.
Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant.
Give it up, he's dead.
[Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me?
[takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
Okay, okay. [gasping]
How'd I get this long triangle?
Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
You know, guys, Michael has really incredible decision-making abilities. Michael's really incredible at making decisions.
There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
Great. [gets up and leaves]
My tombstone's already made, thank you.
Michael, undo it!
I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]
That's kinda uncool, man.
Challenge.
The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...
Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
I'm really hating this Jim guy!
Thanks mom.
Mmmhm.
When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
[to Oscar] Who do you think did it?
Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
Okay.
I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30.  Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what.  I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that.  So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels.  Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
Back in the '60s, I was with the Grass Roots. We toured with Janis Joplin, The Doors, Cream. We had a lot of fun, And now I do quality assurance for a paper company. As you can imagine, drugs played a part. They still do. My work calls last about 90 seconds, and that's about as long as I can concentrate.
I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
Yeah.  That's what she said.
[playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn���t matter. ���Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same���
I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
[after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?
No.
Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura Show.
I did it!
82 November first. How much is the prize money?
Can I go?
Well, draw me a map, mama.
All right.
We hate Pam. We hate Pam.
You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
I saw the leaves twitch!
That wasn't a tapeworm.
You want some?
Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
That's not why.
Think they're talking about me?
One year, I had a close acquaintance of mine back a truck in here and clean out this whole place. That was a very good year. I think they blamed it on some kid.
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
Ah, Hillary Swank.
Listen, I've got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the '70s.
Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
Who's the OB/GYN?
[chuckles] I know. Isn't it something?
She's one sassy black lady.
He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6.  He slides under an 18 wheeler.  Pop.  It snaps right off.
Hi guys.  Somebody makin' soup?
I want to sell your blood!
It's a real shame about Ed, huh?
Something's up.  That paper was never supposed to arrive.
I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
I don't know. It was so long ago.
Let���s find out what I did.
I miss Clinton.
I thought you were gay.
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
A wheel wants to spin, Pam.
If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
Did he actually give you some ganja?
I don't know.
About what?
Bald people make me sick.
Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]
What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. 'What do I do?'... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. 'Qua' something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
Cool beans.
Really?  I thought you. [both laugh in Michael's earshot]
[shaking Holly's hand] The pleasure's all mine.
I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
No, I wanna stay here.
It's thrilling.
This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
[talking through bullhorn] Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I've seen this too many times.
[on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?
Hello. [Jim replaces Creed's apple with a potato][Creed takes a bite of the potato]
Let's do this thing. [Creed loses the first point, tosses his paddle on the table and starts taking off his shirt.  Jim retrieves the ball and looks back to see Creed with his shirt untucked and unbuttoned]
What do you mean, 'Why?'
[bleep] you! [bleep] you! God!
[holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
The tall guy got engaged.
Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.
What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
Hey! What are you guys doing here?
[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
You did good. You did good.
Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
Ugh.
Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
Have fun!  [sigh]
Oh, no. I need the money.
That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.
Any time.
Well, I really, really, really liked it.
How far along?
I hear it, too, Boss.
Oh, oh that's right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].
[notices something new about Dwight] New glasses.
[drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
What?
It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen]
Oh, he does. He does.
