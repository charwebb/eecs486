Sure.
[singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...
The feeling of pure risk.
Oh, oh that's right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].
He don't give an 'F' about nothin'!
Cambodia.  You?
[from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]
Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...
[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
[opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It's a photo of all of us.
It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She's got some children.
[takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
Beleniege!
I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the '70s.
Four nights a week, I sleep under my desk, and then three nights I stay at my place in Toronto. They don't know about this job up there. It's a welfare state. Beautiful countries, both of 'em.
Touch me and I'll sue.
I don't know, let's try.
I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.
Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
Tapas swiss miss.
Good night, Mary Beth!
That is correct.
I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.
I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The 'O'...
That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!
You are welcome.
I really appreciate it, Boss.
What?
No, I wanna stay here.
[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
A wheel wants to spin, Pam.
Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.
Oh, thanks ese.  So, what are you guys doing?
The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.
Thank you very much.
When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
Oh nothing.
Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
She's messed up man...
Okay.
Let���s find out what I did.
All right.
Ah, Hillary Swank.
[walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
I know you don���t really exist.
Challenge.
What, is any of this real?
Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
[Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
If that's flashing, then lock me up.
I miss Clinton.
Thanks mom.
Yep. That's exactly what happened.
You don't want to do that.
Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
[running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
Yes.
Oh ho!  Which one is Pam?
Listen, I've got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
I've done some things I'm not proud of.  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago.  Princess Cruise Lines.
That's not why.
Which aisle?
[still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up 'get out of jail free' cards, those things cost thousands.
Oh my goodness.
I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.
Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant.
[bleep] you! [bleep] you! God!
I did it!
[receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
Hi guys.  Somebody makin' soup?
Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.
Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
Have fun!  [sigh]
Yeah. [Jim enters room]
It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
[from desk chair] Oh, come on!
Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry.  We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
[opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go.
If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?
I don't know. It was so long ago.
Cool beans.
Are you gonna add any more?
Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?
So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
Oh. [laughs]
Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy.  When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.
Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor���s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed���s head] Oh!
Sure.  He hired me.  How's he doing?
Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
Hey, boss, did you find Nemo?
In a way you did.
The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
Let's do this thing. [Creed loses the first point, tosses his paddle on the table and starts taking off his shirt.  Jim retrieves the ball and looks back to see Creed with his shirt untucked and unbuttoned]
Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura Show.
It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But���[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let���s do this.
I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30.  Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what.  I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that.  So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels.  Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
[over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed.
We're screwed.
I don't care which party I go to. Once you've danced naked at a hash bonfire with the spirits of the dead, all parties seem pretty much the same.
Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.
No.
A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
I thought you might.
What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
[playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn���t matter. ���Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same���
Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes...
It's thrilling.
This gal, she's really into you?
Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
[hums]
Hell of an ass.
Mm-hmm.
Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
[Bluetooth rings] You got Creed.
No.
Hey! What are you guys doing here?
Everything's cool, dude.
Undo it!
I do not.
Hank, his name is Hank.
Good work, kid.
What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.
[sighs] Thank God.
I gave Toby my buddy Jorge's number in Costa.  He'll hook Toby up with everything: cable TV, women, oh, and this amazing coffee to snort.
I'll wait. [sighs]
Give it up, he's dead.
Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
Did you start the paperwork yet?
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
I thought you were gay.
Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today.
[spying on David and Jim] They've been in there a while.
Because they're lame.
I'd like to contribute.
You shut up!
Hi kids.
Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
Ed was decapitated.
You're welcome.
Ryan!
We're working. [Jim still holding his breath]
I want pie. I want peach pie.
Who's the OB/GYN?
[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.
No...
Creed Bratton, 75 plus division.
About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I've been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.
Yeah.
Who said that?
Let���s try it out.
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank.  He's a mole person.
Okay.
You think?
That wasn't a tapeworm.
I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
Hi, hello.
Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?
HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow!
We're not playing strip pong? [Jim shakes his head no]  Okay. [Creed picks up paddle]
...Excuse me.
Right place at the right time.
Any time.
So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
On the go that's after three.
I���m sure it���ll turn up.
Let me have a turn.
[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
Hey, Angela's back with her baby.
Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
I don't think I'm there yet, Boss.
Goodnight Mary-Beth.
My wife���s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
I'm having a little trouble motivating.
Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu.  I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
Yes, hello.  Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there.  And I'm trying to remember who it was.  Mm-hmm.  Who wasn't there last week?  Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.
Wesley Silver���s gay?
You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
Us? You and me. The old timers.
What are you telling me?
[looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
I think you two should meet.
Can I go?
You ever notice you can ooze two things: sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.
Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo.
That's from me.
Jinx. Buy me some Coke.
[pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first 'B' stand for?
It���s Halloween. That is really, really good timing.
Remember, you���re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
Michael, undo it!
Well, I really, really, really liked it.
She's looking good.
You did good. You did good.
[feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents.
What's a text?
I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
Animals can't feel pain.
I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
She's crazy hot.
[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
Yes, sir.
Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?
Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage.
[holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
I'm out.
Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
Want to play a game?
We should start our own mall!
He has no wallet, I checked.
What did I say?
Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
I...
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
That's crazy. It's crazy.
Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
To look younger, so the kid doesn't replace you with machines.
You know, guys, Michael has really incredible decision-making abilities. Michael's really incredible at making decisions.
I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It's tragic.  Just tragic.
Thanks.
Well, draw me a map, mama.
[shaking Holly's hand] The pleasure's all mine.
Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
Hey, thanks, ace.
Really?  I thought you. [both laugh in Michael's earshot]
When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
[drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
Oh, no. I need the money.
What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. 'What do I do?'... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. 'Qua' something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
Bald people make me sick.
The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...
I'm just looking.
They make a nice couple.
I don't know. I got nephews.
You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
Here.
That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]
Just doing my job, guys.
Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
About what?
All right, thank you, bye-bye.
No. No. No. You���re way off on that one.
How far along?
I don't know, man. I just don't know.
In a minute.
Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? [playing well]
You don't have to do this, Michael.
Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
Bonnie Hunt is on.
Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over.  It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.
Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
[on phone] Daat!
It's Kismet!
Your shower radio.
[walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week.
What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.
[Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me?
[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...
Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.
Okay, you take it easy, ace.
Here's the $40 you gave me.
[smacks Meredith���s head] [screams] [runs out]
I heard that from... Andy.
Back in the '60s, I was with the Grass Roots. We toured with Janis Joplin, The Doors, Cream. We had a lot of fun, And now I do quality assurance for a paper company. As you can imagine, drugs played a part. They still do. My work calls last about 90 seconds, and that's about as long as I can concentrate.
One year, I had a close acquaintance of mine back a truck in here and clean out this whole place. That was a very good year. I think they blamed it on some kid.
Come on, boss.
[singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
Ditto that, my brother.
We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?
The balls on you, man.
I am indeed. How'd you know that?
Just boardin', you know how we do. [flips skateboard up]
Hey!
Can't be good.
I can bring these to my shelter.
Ah, Dwell.
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
Exactly.
It's a real shame about Ed, huh?
Think they're talking about me?
I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
That's kinda uncool, man.
Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.
I watch you when you sleep.
Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6.  He slides under an 18 wheeler.  Pop.  It snaps right off.
Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
[notices something new about Dwight] New glasses.
[talking through bullhorn] Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I've seen this too many times.
What size?
Okay, okay. [gasping]
The perfect cartwheel.
I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless.
Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here?
Let's fight it.
It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
I hate devils food.
82 November first. How much is the prize money?
Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
Let's put a smile on that face!
OK. Hang on just a second.  Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
Creed! Ha!
I want to sell your blood!
Sup? [rolls into kitchen on a skateboard]
Did he actually give you some ganja?
Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]
I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
The tall guy got engaged.
The real question here is who's this guy work for?
Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work.
: I'm not offended by homosexuality.  In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain.  And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.
No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.
In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
Ah, it's all starting to make sense now.
Pirate code, he wants to meet.
[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
Hey!
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
I don't know what to tell you.
Something's up.  That paper was never supposed to arrive.
I'm really hating this Jim guy!
[on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?
Oh, he does. He does.
Suit yourself.  But, if it were me, Botox [points at Oscar], wig [points at Kevin].
[carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I���m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
Who has AIDS?
And a happy holiday to you.
Yeah.  That's what she said.
Hey, why haven't we ever, um...
Whacky-weed Creed.
You want some?
I want a nice cobbler.
How'd I get this long triangle?
[Dwight pulls over to pick up hitchhiker] Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael.
Not cool man. [walks out]
No, no. I had some, thanks.
I saw the leaves twitch!
Ok, thirty seconds to showtime!
Mmmhm.
[motions to phyllis's desk]
[to Rose] You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
Oh... Where did you get this stuff?
Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
No, but I still have my medal from that.
Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
Fifteen years, I think.
Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'
I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
We hate Pam. We hate Pam.
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair...
I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.
It's not cool.
When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.
Okay. What about your friend?
[to Oscar] Who do you think did it?
Great. [gets up and leaves]
Yes, sir.
I hear it, too, Boss.
