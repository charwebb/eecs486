Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
Really?  I thought you. [both laugh in Michael's earshot]
The real question here is who's this guy work for?
The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
No. No. No. You���re way off on that one.
The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...
Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
[Creed pulls into the parking lot and goes into the office]  Sorry I'm late, boss.  What's going on?
Do you want me to give it a shot? Just...
He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat.
Remember, you���re a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry.  We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
[to Rose] You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
I've done some things I'm not proud of.  Committed some atrocities in Vietnam, uh, two years ago.  Princess Cruise Lines.
I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.
What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
To look younger, so the kid doesn't replace you with machines.
Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
We're not playing strip pong? [Jim shakes his head no]  Okay. [Creed picks up paddle]
Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
[to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She's got some children.
[approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.
[from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer]
I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant.
Ah, it's all starting to make sense now.
[Dwight pulls over to pick up hitchhiker] Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
Yeah. Yeah. And I buy them stuff, you know. Oh, made some bad investments. Why are you asking me this?
[opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go.
Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?
[looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.
Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.
Oh, oh that's right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].
Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor���s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed���s head] Oh!
Just boardin', you know how we do. [flips skateboard up]
Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'
: I'm not offended by homosexuality.  In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain.  And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.
It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
[to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
My wife���s name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
Yeah, that makes way more sense.   Okay thanks boss.
No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?
You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
Hello. [Jim replaces Creed's apple with a potato][Creed takes a bite of the potato]
[running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
Listen, I've got the answer.  You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
[on cell phone] Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.
[Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me?
[opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It's a photo of all of us.
All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.
I gave Toby my buddy Jorge's number in Costa.  He'll hook Toby up with everything: cable TV, women, oh, and this amazing coffee to snort.
I don't care which party I go to. Once you've danced naked at a hash bonfire with the spirits of the dead, all parties seem pretty much the same.
Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
I love it. I actually used to have a radio show back in the '70s.
You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts.  Nobody just picks up 'get out of jail free' cards, those things cost thousands.
OK. Hang on just a second.  Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
82 November first. How much is the prize money?
I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]
[singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
Back in the '60s, I was with the Grass Roots. We toured with Janis Joplin, The Doors, Cream. We had a lot of fun, And now I do quality assurance for a paper company. As you can imagine, drugs played a part. They still do. My work calls last about 90 seconds, and that's about as long as I can concentrate.
[on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.
[zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a penis. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question: Why are you here?
I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today.
Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
One year, I had a close acquaintance of mine back a truck in here and clean out this whole place. That was a very good year. I think they blamed it on some kid.
[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.
[spying on David and Jim] They've been in there a while.
Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It's tragic.  Just tragic.
Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
You know, guys, Michael has really incredible decision-making abilities. Michael's really incredible at making decisions.
I can get you one in an hour.
Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.
Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
[to Oscar] Who do you think did it?
[receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
It���s Halloween. That is really, really good timing.
You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
[from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
[to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
Oh, thanks ese.  So, what are you guys doing?
$3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
Suit yourself.  But, if it were me, Botox [points at Oscar], wig [points at Kevin].
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
[walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week.
Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over.  It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I've been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.
Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6.  He slides under an 18 wheeler.  Pop.  It snaps right off.
[singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...
[drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
Something's up.  That paper was never supposed to arrive.
I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30.  Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what.  I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that.  So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels.  Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
I go to New York all the time, to visit my buddy Frank.  He's a mole person.
Four nights a week, I sleep under my desk, and then three nights I stay at my place in Toronto. They don't know about this job up there. It's a welfare state. Beautiful countries, both of 'em.
Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.
Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
[knocking from outside window in break room] Jim.
When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
I don't know, man. I just don't know.
[playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?
Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Well, you never asked me about my life before, is all.
A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go gang! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left]
It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu.  I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
[on phone] Yo, is this his new chair?
[as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no.
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
No, but I still have my medal from that.
Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying.  You were inferring.
For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. 'What do I do?'... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. 'Qua' something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...
Guys, E, blues. Follow me, okay? [playing well]
[after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you hit me for?
You ever notice you can ooze two things: sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.
It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
Do you have something specific you wanted to talk to me about?
Yes, hello.  Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there.  And I'm trying to remember who it was.  Mm-hmm.  Who wasn't there last week?  Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.
I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good.
[talking through bullhorn] Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I've seen this too many times.
[takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
[feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents.
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.
That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?
Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?
Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
No, you have the power to undo it.
[still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50's, they're meaningless.
Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage.
Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
[playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn���t matter. ���Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same���
You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
