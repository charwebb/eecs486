Well, I was going to say why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
You looking for a job?
I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
You don't know.
They're so soft and milky white.
(entering the apartment) Vincent!
(nodding) Poor. (Elaine mouths 'oo')
So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
What is it?
No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
Really?
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
Yeah, it's in my purse.
(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
You know the time!
Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
Which market?
So, are they a nice couple?
What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
What're you so tense about?
Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)
Hi. JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
What are you doing?
Goin' on four years.
Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.
Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
What is it?
But I didn't do anything.
Yes.
Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
Come here. (moves in for a kiss)
Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?
Mulva?
I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
Well, this is where I get off.
(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?
(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?
You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
All right, we're done. You can have it now.
Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
Oh, Nice to meet you, George.
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
Yeah. I really have to be going.
Oh, hi.
Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
Make your-self comfortable.
Well I won't be long.
Nice.
Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
Do you know how to double-clutch?
(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
Yes.
Oh, hello.
Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
Who are you?
Did he send you part of our VCR?
(crying)
(To Leslie) So, when's your due date?
Who are you?
I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
Thank you.
Are you going upstairs? Tell my fianc I'm looking for him. I havelost my fianc, the poor baby.
Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)
How did this start?
Bye George.
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
I don't know.
AHAaaaaaaaaa! (scream)
Mm. Bye Jerry.
Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
No.
How well do you know her?
A thousand.
Oh, I have Junior Mints.
Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
"Seinsmelled"?
(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
What?
Oh, don't worry. I do.
Nice to meet you.
(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?
I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...
Why don't you just make another wish?
Which one?
Hmm..
(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)
(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
Excuse me. Can I help you?
I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere...
A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
Yeah.
Where's Glenn?
Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
I don't know.
So, you're in 'the market'?
(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
(Behind service window) Im allergic to coconut.
Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
What about a shooting star?
What?
Well, you're reading the classifieds.
Yeah, what is it?
Newman, I'm bored.
Oh, oh Jerry...
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
George Costanza? Estelles son?
So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
huh.
No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)
Get the bikes.
You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
You want to give it a try?
