What're you so tense about?
Get the bikes.
Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
David, you are so funny.
What?
Are you going upstairs? Tell my fianc I'm looking for him. I havelost my fianc, the poor baby.
You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
Yeah. I really have to be going.
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
What?
Yeah, it's in my purse.
(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?
Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?
You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
What is it?
Yeah, not bad at all.
(Behind service window) Im allergic to coconut.
Well I won't be long.
AHAaaaaaaaaa! (scream)
Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.
You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
Excuse me. Can I help you?
(entering the apartment) Vincent!
(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
huh.
And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
"Seinsmelled"?
No.
Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
How did this start?
Yeah, what is it?
What about a shooting star?
Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
Did he send you part of our VCR?
Newman, I'm bored.
It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
Mulva?
Nice.
Why don't you just make another wish?
Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)
(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?
Oh, I have Junior Mints.
I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
They're quite exquisite!
So, are they a nice couple?
(To Leslie) So, when's your due date?
What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
Oh, hello.
Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?
So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
Well, I was going to say why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
A thousand.
I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
Yes.
Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
Oh, hi.
Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
You want to give it a try?
Make your-self comfortable.
Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
Who are you?
But I didn't do anything.
When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere...
Thank you.
You looking for a job?
Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?
Bye George.
I don't know.
Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
All right, we're done. You can have it now.
George Costanza? Estelles son?
Hmm..
I'm taking your clothes.
Well, this is where I get off.
Well, you're reading the classifieds.
Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
What are you doing?
Yes.
Who are you?
I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
(crying)
Which market?
Do you know how to double-clutch?
You know the time!
Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
Like what?
Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...
Oh, oh Jerry...
I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
Which one?
What's the problem?
Hi. JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
Mm. Bye Jerry.
Come here. (moves in for a kiss)
I don't know.
You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
Yeah.
Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)
There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames! Peterman gets up and runs towards the door, he stops and looks back. George is still sitting on the couch, looking up and shaking his head.
Really?
You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
Oh, don't worry. I do.
Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
Nice to meet you.
So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
Goin' on four years.
Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
