They're so soft and milky white.
Come here. (moves in for a kiss)
Oh, Nice to meet you, George.
(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
I had it autographed for my uncle.
Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, oh Jerry...
(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
Newman, I'm bored.
Like what?
Yes.
Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
"Seinsmelled"?
Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
So, you're in 'the market'?
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
(Behind service window) Im allergic to coconut.
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
Oh, I have Junior Mints.
AHAaaaaaaaaa! (scream)
What is it?
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
You don't know.
It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
Did he send you part of our VCR?
Yeah, not bad at all.
huh.
David, you are so funny.
(entering the apartment) Vincent!
Yeah. I really have to be going.
Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
All right, we're done. You can have it now.
There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames! Peterman gets up and runs towards the door, he stops and looks back. George is still sitting on the couch, looking up and shaking his head.
You know the time!
(reaches out to Jerry) Mr. O'Brien?
Bye George.
What?
Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
Which one?
Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
(To Leslie) So, when's your due date?
No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)
Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
Well I won't be long.
What are you doing?
Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
I don't know.
Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...
Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
Thank you.
Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?
Mm. Bye Jerry.
What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
What is it?
Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
(crying)
You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
(nodding) Poor. (Elaine mouths 'oo')
They're quite exquisite!
Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
Excuse me. Can I help you?
I don't know.
(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)
(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
Nice.
I'm taking your clothes.
I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.
Why don't you just make another wish?
It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
Where's Glenn?
Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?
How well do you know her?
Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
Hmm..
Yeah, what is it?
Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
Hi. JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
What about a shooting star?
What?
What're you so tense about?
Oh, don't worry. I do.
Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
Are you going upstairs? Tell my fianc I'm looking for him. I havelost my fianc, the poor baby.
You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)
What's the problem?
Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?
When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere...
How did this start?
A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
Oh, hi.
(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
Mulva?
So, are they a nice couple?
Who are you?
Yes.
George Costanza? Estelles son?
You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
Oh, hello.
You looking for a job?
So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
Goin' on four years.
Well, I was going to say why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
No.
A thousand.
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
Yeah, it's in my purse.
Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?
You want to give it a try?
Who are you?
But I didn't do anything.
Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
Get the bikes.
Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)
Well, you're reading the classifieds.
