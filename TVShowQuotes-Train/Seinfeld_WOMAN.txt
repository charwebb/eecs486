About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)
You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)
Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)
(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.
You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
Hi. JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
All right, we're done. You can have it now.
I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
Did he send you part of our VCR?
Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?
Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)
Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames! Peterman gets up and runs towards the door, he stops and looks back. George is still sitting on the couch, looking up and shaking his head.
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere...
Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?
(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?
(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?
What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
Are you going upstairs? Tell my fianc I'm looking for him. I havelost my fianc, the poor baby.
