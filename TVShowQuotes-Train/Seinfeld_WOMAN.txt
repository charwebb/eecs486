It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
I don't know.
(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)
Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
Hmm..
Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)
You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?
What's the problem?
Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
AHAaaaaaaaaa! (scream)
Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
How did this start?
Well, you're reading the classifieds.
How well do you know her?
And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
Newman, I'm bored.
Yeah. I really have to be going.
I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?
What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
Oh, Nice to meet you, George.
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
What?
Yeah, what is it?
Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
What're you so tense about?
Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
Are you going upstairs? Tell my fianc I'm looking for him. I havelost my fianc, the poor baby.
Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
You know the time!
(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
Did he send you part of our VCR?
Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
Yes.
Make your-self comfortable.
What are you doing?
(reaches out to Jerry) Mr. O'Brien?
What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
Oh, oh Jerry...
Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
Oh, hi.
You don't know.
(crying)
Excuse me. Can I help you?
Why don't you just make another wish?
"Seinsmelled"?
Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.
So, you're in 'the market'?
Well, this is where I get off.
Like what?
(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
Then shouldn't you be wearing the bucket?
So, are they a nice couple?
Well I won't be long.
(nodding) Poor. (Elaine mouths 'oo')
What?
You looking for a job?
Do you know how to double-clutch?
What is it?
I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
Oh, I have Junior Mints.
Where's Glenn?
You want to give it a try?
Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
Bye George.
I had it autographed for my uncle.
There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames! Peterman gets up and runs towards the door, he stops and looks back. George is still sitting on the couch, looking up and shaking his head.
Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
Really?
(To Leslie) So, when's your due date?
Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
Who are you?
They're quite exquisite!
I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
David, you are so funny.
I'm taking your clothes.
Oh, don't worry. I do.
(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
(entering the apartment) Vincent!
Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)
A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
Come here. (moves in for a kiss)
Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere...
No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)
What is it?
George Costanza? Estelles son?
Which one?
A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
Which market?
Nice to meet you.
But I didn't do anything.
Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
Thank you.
They're so soft and milky white.
huh.
Get the bikes.
Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
(Behind service window) Im allergic to coconut.
You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...
And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
All right, we're done. You can have it now.
Yeah, not bad at all.
I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
Oh, hello.
Yes.
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
Yeah.
Mulva?
(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
No.
Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?
Nice.
So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
Mm. Bye Jerry.
Well, I was going to say why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
Hi. JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
