You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
Great seats. You could see the actors spitting.
Oh, well, I really think I'm falling for you... [opens the playbill and flips five pages till he finds and reads autograph] .....Joseph Puglia...
Did he send you part of our VCR?
Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)
Y'know my cousin knows the producer. I may get to go backstage and meet Olympia Dukakis.
Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
Hi. JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?
Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?
When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere...
Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
Well, I was going to say why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?
I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames! Peterman gets up and runs towards the door, he stops and looks back. George is still sitting on the couch, looking up and shaking his head.
(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?
No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)
(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)
What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
All right, we're done. You can have it now.
You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
