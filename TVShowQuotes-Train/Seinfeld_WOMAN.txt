(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
All right, we're done. You can have it now.
A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
Why does this dummy have a bucket on its head?
Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?
Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.
So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
Uh-huh. And afterwards we went backstage and Olympia Dukakis autographed my playbill.
Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny!
I wonder what happened to my fianc. I know he's here somewhere. Ellen? Have you seen my fianc?
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
(con't) Of course, not everybody can be as sweet as you are.
Some jerk parked in a handicap spot, so this woman in a wheelchair had to wheel up this incline, and half way up her batteries gave up, and she rolled backwards into the wall. Taken her to St. Elizabeth's...
Did he send you part of our VCR?
How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
(Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)
You know, I was wondering - if you're not doing anything later, maybe you'd like to get together..?
Are you kidding? They were merciless! What do you expect when your name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy?
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
Bon-jour, welcome to the Gateway to Paris Charter Flight.
Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?
No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her things up)
So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone for you.
So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
I don't know. We're just waiting here for the owner of this car to show up. May not get out alive! Thug! Taking up a handicap spot? He's gonna pay!
It was great working with you. (Somewhat coy) Your hands are beautiful.
When youre dead, youre dead. Thats it. Youre not goin anywhere...
I could listen to you talk about mail all day.
(Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
(Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand modeling?
(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
Well, I'm his mother. (stern) Vincent, what's going on here?
Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
There's a big fire down the street, the whole block is going up in flames! Peterman gets up and runs towards the door, he stops and looks back. George is still sitting on the couch, looking up and shaking his head.
I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
I'll be back. I'm not feeling very well.
Well, I better get going. I don't want to be late for the play. (Grabs her coat.)
Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
(licks he lips) You don't know my name, do you?
Um, I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.
(Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?
Y'know I really think I'm falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld. (stands up, a quick kiss on the cheek and hugs him.)
Well, I was going to say why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
Hi. JERRY You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
