Hey!
Where are the muffin tops?
Aw, drop dead!
Come on, make a wish! Make a wish!
Can't do it.
She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.
Let's smash it!
Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had.
Wh, when is that?
(waiting in line for tickets, he overhears Elaine) Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth!
I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'
Now give me your code!
(to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys.
Ooohhh... Argghhh..
(Off-screen) Hey, shut up up there!
Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold.
What area? New Jersey?
Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes.
You've done it again, C.K.!
(Pulling a slip of paper out of his coat pocket) And here's your check. (George accepts) Thank you very much. (Pats him on the back) It was an honor.
You shot Death Blow?
Alright, see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey.
Who's that?
Well, you know what opium is made from...
(Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love..
I've never seen hands like these before..
(on the phone) Front desk...?
Aaahhhgggg!
Ooooooohhh..
Yeah?
I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.
That was brilliant.
It's up to you.
Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck.
What are you doing?
Please, rest Mr. Pitt.
Mr. Steinfeld?
She exposed her nipple.
Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?
I'm really kinda seein' somebody.
Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.
No.
What's the problem?
All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.
Will you put that cigarette out, please?
Hey, hey! You dented my ride.
Are you through? (annoyed)
You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.
(Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.
Watch your step.
Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!
It doesn't look like garbage.
Took a very dangerous combination prescription heart medicine and these other pills.
Thank you.
The surgeon left a sponge inside me.
What is this? A piece of pound cake?
Ugh.. Ray.
You Steinfeld?
There's a clock over there.
But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!
Nice day
These clothes. The ones you're wearing.
Yes sir.
(To secretary) Expira te afuera.
George?
What about cigars?
Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..
Sure.
Hey, this Clark bar is good.
I like that jacket..
We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?
Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.
Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!
Hey!
I told you, it's right over there.
Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--
The machine won't open without the code!
What?
(In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut.
Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward.
Keep fighting matey! Get your head above the water! I've got you matey! I've got you! Matey! (he loses the rope) I'll remember her name! Elaine Benes! I'll write to her. I'll tell her all about you and what you did out here! Goodbye, matey! Goddbye!
Okay.
She passed.
Shut up!
(also seated at the counter) Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.
Good day Ms. Benes. Its Roger Ipswitch.
The code!! The code!!
646?
It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.
(with disbelief) You'll never pull it off.
Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.
You're soaking wet. Who are you?
(pointing) There.
That's what I'd like to know about it.
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.
Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.
So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?
Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
What cough?
Will you put that cigarette out?!
Are you going to eat thoise fries?
(Confused) Cigars?
Do I have to dial a one first?
There's people down there! Hold on!
You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
Eat hickory!!
Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.
They just put out some more donuts.
It's right by the escalator.
Whats the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?
Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her.
!Mira! !Mira! Stacy Keach!
(frustrated) Damn thing is jammed again..
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?
Holders.
Who let you in?
Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.
How 'bout leading us in a toast?
Oh yeah.
How about I do you a favor upside your head?
Who are you with?
(Holding his up) Last one.
Thank you both for being here.
Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?
Hey Jerry.
You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number.
I didn't. My friend was getting it.
I did? Where?
Hey hey, I'm on line here.
