Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.
Aw, drop dead!
(also seated at the counter) Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.
Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--
Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?
Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.
(Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.
She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.
All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.
Wh, when is that?
I'm really kinda seein' somebody.
Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.
That was brilliant.
(To secretary) Expira te afuera.
Well, you know what opium is made from...
(on the phone) Front desk...?
The surgeon left a sponge inside me.
I've never seen hands like these before..
Ugh.. Ray.
Who's that?
Wha? What d'you want?
What's the problem?
Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.
Nice day
(Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love..
What is your name, Senor?
It's up to you.
Are you through? (annoyed)
Earth.

Shut up!
(Confused) Cigars?
You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.
(to George) Hey, do you have the time?
It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.
Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.
Please, rest Mr. Pitt.
I didn't. My friend was getting it.
Hey, this Clark bar is good.
George?
Thank you both for being here.
(Holding his up) Last one.
How 'bout leading us in a toast?
Come on, let's go.
I did? Where?
(In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut.
Are you going to eat thoise fries?
But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!
Yeah, they kicked us all out.
You shot Death Blow?

The machine won't open without the code!
(Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I uh only hope you have a little more self-control.
(waiting in line for tickets, he overhears Elaine) Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth!
They just put out some more donuts.
What are you doing?
Took a very dangerous combination prescription heart medicine and these other pills.
How about I do you a favor upside your head?
(pointing) There.
(with disbelief) You'll never pull it off.
Oh, Excuse me.
You've done it again, C.K.!
So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?
Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!
Watch your step.
Hey, hey! You dented my ride.
You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
She passed.
I told you, it's right over there.
Where are the muffin tops?
Good day Ms. Benes. Its Roger Ipswitch.
Holders.
Who are you with?
(frustrated) Damn thing is jammed again..
Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward.
(to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys.
I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer. (He starts pulling her to safety)
Hey!
Yes sir.
Alright, see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey.
What about cigars?
What cough?
Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold.
Do I have to dial a one first?
Let's smash it!
It doesn't look like garbage.
You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number.
Who let you in?
What?
Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck.
You're soaking wet. Who are you?
I like that jacket..
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.
Keep fighting matey! Get your head above the water! I've got you matey! I've got you! Matey! (he loses the rope) I'll remember her name! Elaine Benes! I'll write to her. I'll tell her all about you and what you did out here! Goodbye, matey! Goddbye!
Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..
Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?
My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place.
Sure.
Can't do it.
I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.
She exposed her nipple.
Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?
