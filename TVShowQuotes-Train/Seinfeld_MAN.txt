I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.
We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?
Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.
Yeah?
Mr. Steinfeld?
(Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I uh only hope you have a little more self-control.
You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number.
She exposed her nipple.
Who are you with?
What area? New Jersey?
Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..
All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.
Can't do it.
Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold.
!Mira! !Mira! Stacy Keach!
Are you going to eat thoise fries?
Hey, this Clark bar is good.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, make a wish! Make a wish!
(frustrated) Damn thing is jammed again..
These clothes. The ones you're wearing.
Who let you in?
No.
George?
(Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.
Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?
Now give me your code!
But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!
That's what I'd like to know about it.
(pointing) There.
Nice day
What's the problem?
They just put out some more donuts.
Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--
I'm really kinda seein' somebody.
The machine won't open without the code!
Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.
There's people down there! Hold on!
(In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut.
Let's smash it!
Are you through? (annoyed)
My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place.
Thank you.
She passed.
Whats the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?
I didn't. My friend was getting it.
Eat hickory!!
You're soaking wet. Who are you?
Holders.
Who's that?
Keep fighting matey! Get your head above the water! I've got you matey! I've got you! Matey! (he loses the rope) I'll remember her name! Elaine Benes! I'll write to her. I'll tell her all about you and what you did out here! Goodbye, matey! Goddbye!
That was brilliant.
Hey!
Ooooooohhh..
Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've only got two spots to fill. Good luck.
You shot Death Blow?
You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.
Okay.
Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?
Hey hey, I'm on line here.
Please, rest Mr. Pitt.
What about cigars?
You've done it again, C.K.!
Ugh.. Ray.
So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?
Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes.
She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.
It's up to you.
Hey!
Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.
I told you, it's right over there.
Oh yeah.
Wha? What d'you want?
Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.
Thank you both for being here.
What?
Shut up!
The code!! The code!!
Oh, Excuse me.
Do I have to dial a one first?
Wh, when is that?
(Confused) Cigars?
(waiting in line for tickets, he overhears Elaine) Hey, give us a break. We haven't seen it yet. Thanks a lot big mouth!
Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
There's a clock over there.
Yes sir.
Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.
Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.
Will you put that cigarette out?!
Now I got you!
Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best haircut I've ever had.
Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.
Hey, hey! You dented my ride.
You Steinfeld?
Earth.
Will you put that cigarette out, please?
I like that jacket..
(To secretary) Expira te afuera.
(with disbelief) You'll never pull it off.
Well, you know what opium is made from...
It doesn't look like garbage.
I did? Where?
Watch your step.
Ooohhh... Argghhh..
Sure.
Alright, see ya. (Meets Tina in the door) Hey.
Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!
What cough?
(on the phone) Front desk...?

(to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys.
646?
Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?
What is this? A piece of pound cake?
Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.
It's right by the escalator.
(Pulling a slip of paper out of his coat pocket) And here's your check. (George accepts) Thank you very much. (Pats him on the back) It was an honor.
The surgeon left a sponge inside me.
Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!
I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come here. Do you recognize anybody in the lineup?
How about I do you a favor upside your head?
(also seated at the counter) Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.
Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.
I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'
Yeah, they kicked us all out.
(Holding his up) Last one.
Aaahhhgggg!
What is your name, Senor?
What are you doing?
Good day Ms. Benes. Its Roger Ipswitch.
