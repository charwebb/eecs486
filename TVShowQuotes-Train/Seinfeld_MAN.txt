Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.

You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number.
(Confused) Cigars?

Aaahhhgggg!
What's the problem?
Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!
Thank you both for being here.
(Quick, to the point) The muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw. (Holds hand up, displaying a claw-like shape) He traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. Towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils, (Visibly disgusted by this last part) and was dependent on Cub Scouts to feed him. I hadn't seen another pair of hands like Ray McKigney's until today. You are his successor. (George looks down at his hands) I uh only hope you have a little more self-control.
(also seated at the counter) Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.
So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?
Yes sir.
Ooohhh... Argghhh..
(Clears throat) Tragic story, I'm afraid. He could've had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love..
How 'bout leading us in a toast?
All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.
Oh, Excuse me.

Can't do it.
What is your name, Senor?
Well, you know what opium is made from...
The machine won't open without the code!
Hey hey, I'm on line here.
It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.
Ooooooohhh..
(on the phone) Front desk...?
You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.
I didn't. My friend was getting it.
I did? Where?
Who let you in?
Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold.
Come on, make a wish! Make a wish!
Hey, this Clark bar is good.
That's what I'd like to know about it.
My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place.

What cough?
There's a clock over there.
Nice day

(Holding his up) Last one.

Now give me your code!
Good day Ms. Benes. Its Roger Ipswitch.

Hey!
I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'

Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.
Wow! Is that Danny Tartabull?
Aw, drop dead!
Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
You Steinfeld?
I'd like to shake his hand but I can't.
Let's smash it!
(In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut.
Hey, I have been trying to get this book signed all day.
Watch your step.
How about I do you a favor upside your head?

She exposed her nipple.
Took a very dangerous combination prescription heart medicine and these other pills.
You're soaking wet. Who are you?

It's up to you.
Where are we going?
(to Fred and Paul) See you back at the office, guys.
Yeah, they kicked us all out.
(with disbelief) You'll never pull it off.
Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.
Who are you with?
Whats the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?
Yes. he was not.. master of his domain.
Oh yeah.
Ugh.. Ray.
(Pulling a slip of paper out of his coat pocket) And here's your check. (George accepts) Thank you very much. (Pats him on the back) It was an honor.
Thank you.
Where are the muffin tops?
It doesn't look like garbage.
I've never seen hands like these before..
Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.
You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
Please, rest Mr. Pitt.
The surgeon left a sponge inside me.
Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..
Who's that?
Eat hickory!!
Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her.
Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.
Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--
I like that jacket..
Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes.

That was brilliant.
You've done it again, C.K.!
(Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.
Sure.
Okay.
Hey Jerry.
There's people down there! Hold on!
I'm really kinda seein' somebody.

It's right by the escalator.
Wh, when is that?
Earth.
