Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office, but it's locked) Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.
K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger!
George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.
All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?
I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.
Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.
It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?
Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?
George, I got something for you. (Pulls a check from his pocket) I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me, so, what's the difference? (Hands the check to George)
Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?
(getting up to leave) Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me.
George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.
According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?
Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.
George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair) Three times around, no feet.
Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.
George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year.
How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?
(Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George?
So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?
Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair.
You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.
Not if you could see our books.. what's this?
I don't care. Let's find you an office.
Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?
George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.
...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble.
