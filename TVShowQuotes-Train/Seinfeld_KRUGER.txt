All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?
...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble.
Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.
(getting up to leave) Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me.
(Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George?
Yeah, you probably should.
All me.
George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year.
Ahem. Now, what's your name?
Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.
Alright, alright I'm going.
We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George.
Let's order lunch.
George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair) Three times around, no feet.
Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?
Goodnight everybody!
Hey, Koko, Who's this?
According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?
You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.
But there isn't.
Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?
I'm not too worried about it.
I'm not too worried about it.
George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.
T-bone!
They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my main man.
Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office, but it's locked) Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.
Who's Gammy?
I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.
Not if you could see our books.. what's this?
It's K-uger!
Ok, good enough for me, Koko.
So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?
Are you making all this up, too?
George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?
George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.
Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair.
Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.
Mary, I will have a chef's salad.
I don't care. Let's find you an office.
It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?
How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?
Well, then we should call you T-bone.
Koko the monkey.
Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?
George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.
Vemonous?
Whatever. (Walks off)
For lunch?
I find your belief system fascinating.
K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger!
Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?
