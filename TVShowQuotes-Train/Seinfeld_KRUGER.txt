I'm not too worried about it.
Mary, I will have a chef's salad.
Alright, alright I'm going.
Yeah, you probably should.
How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?
They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my main man.
George, I got something for you. (Pulls a check from his pocket) I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me, so, what's the difference? (Hands the check to George)
...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble.
George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.
All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?
So, how am I looking?
For lunch?
It's K-uger!
All me.
But there isn't.
George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.
George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.
Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.
George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year.
So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?
Let's order lunch.
T-bone!
Ahem. Now, what's your name?
Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.
Who's Gammy?
George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair) Three times around, no feet.
I'm not too worried about it.
Whatever. (Walks off)
George.
George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?
Not if you could see our books.. what's this?
I don't care. Let's find you an office.
(getting up to leave) Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me.
Goodnight everybody!
Vemonous?
Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?
Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?
Koko the monkey.
(Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George?
Are you making all this up, too?
It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?
I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.
Hey, Koko, Who's this?
Maybe there should be a Gammy.
Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office, but it's locked) Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.
Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?
Works for me. Good thinking, George.
K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger!
Ok, good enough for me, Koko.
According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?
We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George.
Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair.
