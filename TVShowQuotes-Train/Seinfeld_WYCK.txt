George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic.
Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.
Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?
I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.
Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?
You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! (Everyone but George laughs) Contratulations, young man. (Shakes Steven's hand)
George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?
Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident.
Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price.
Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.
They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.
Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?
So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.
Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.
These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.
