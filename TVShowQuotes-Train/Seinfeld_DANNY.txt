Hmm.
Hey.
Three of you guys for one sale.
Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
Are you serious?
Uh...I mean-yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
So. You're all on the list!
Okay...that's different.
You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...
I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think.
I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now.
Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! [knocking on wall] Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.
Okay.
Okay. You wanna know?  I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
Yeah. Way ,way, way back.
[laughing] Well, that does not sound like me.
Hola. Que tal?
You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-
Thanks.
Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
Was it two? I thought it was three.
Well, we'll get this...[Meredith unbuttons]
For sure.
More freedom.
Jim and Pam really don't want you to go?
Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you.
Oh.
Can you imagine? It's just crazy.
No! Two or three dates.
Okay.
Or...crazy.
Oh, I'm just here for the coffee.
Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
What are you talking about?
I'll talk to them.
Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar.
Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
Michael Scott.
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.
But from where?
Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]
We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?
Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.
Get out of my way.
I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
[stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.
This is some party, huh?
Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky.
[opening door again to leave] No!
Good to see you too.
Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.
Oh. She was not into me.
Exactly.
What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that! [opens door to leave]
I'm very upset!
