Yeah.
Well, I really love that piece.
(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?
(laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)
Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
Ah, I gotta go. (Gets up to leave)
I just need to freshen up.
Hello, George.
Don't you think that's strange?
No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!
Nice to meet you, too.
Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.
Really?
Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?
George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you?
And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!
Jerry?
Honestly, George, the money's not important.
(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving.
Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.
No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to do.
Are you an art-lover?
She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
Tell me about Elaine.
By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya?
(From Jerry's room) Jerry?
(rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?
Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.
Okay.
George I need to freshen., George, George, George ...
Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)
Yeah!
What's the appeal of the posse?
Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)
My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.
Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!
I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.
What are you doing here George?
Heh.. yeah.
I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that.
No... not really. You?
Elaine?
Will you excuse me.
Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
I don't know... maybe.
George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.
Oh, are you interested?
How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)
Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
But, they're still friends.
It's great talkin'
Mmmm mm so good.
Good, good.
(Casually) Alright.. Neither.
Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
Bye. (Leaves)
