George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you?
Mmmm mm so good.
Yeah.
Elaine?
Oh, I'm so full.
Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)
She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
(Casually) Alright.. Neither.
Tell me about Elaine.
Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
Heh.. yeah.
What's the appeal of the posse?
What are you doing here George?
Don't you think that's strange?
(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving.
Are you an art-lover?
And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!
Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.
Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.
Good, good.
George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.
But, they're still friends.
Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
Ah, I gotta go. (Gets up to leave)
A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.
Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
(From Jerry's room) Jerry?
(laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)
Honestly, George, the money's not important.
Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?
Yeah!
It's great talkin'
(rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?
Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)
My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.
Really?
No... not really. You?
How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)
Oh. Hi.
Nice to meet you, too.
Well, I really love that piece.
Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!
Will you excuse me.
By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya?
(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?
I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that.
(Getting ready to leave) Oh, I should... um...
Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
Hi.
I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.
I just need to freshen up.
Hello, George.
Okay.
Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.
No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to do.
Oh, are you interested?
