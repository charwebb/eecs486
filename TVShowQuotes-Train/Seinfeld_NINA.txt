(Getting ready to leave) Oh, I should... um...
Okay.
Are you an art-lover?
Well, I really love that piece.
Ah, I gotta go. (Gets up to leave)
My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.
I just need to freshen up.
Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.
Mmmm mm so good.
(rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?
And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!
Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!
But, they're still friends.
A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.
Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
Honestly, George, the money's not important.
George I need to freshen., George, George, George ...
Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?
How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)
It's great talkin'
Yeah.
Nice to meet you, too.
Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.
No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!
No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to do.
Don't you think that's strange?
Elaine?
Jerry?
(From Jerry's room) Jerry?
(Casually) Alright.. Neither.
Bye. (Leaves)
Yeah!
What are you doing here George?
Will you excuse me.
Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!
(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving.
Hi.
Really?
Oh, I'm so full.
Tell me about Elaine.
I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that.
George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.
George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you?
Hello, George.
She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
What's the appeal of the posse?
By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya?
Heh.. yeah.
Oh. Hi.
I don't know... maybe.
No... not really. You?
Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?
Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)
Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
