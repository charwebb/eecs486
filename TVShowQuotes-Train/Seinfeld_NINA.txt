(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?
Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?
(Getting ready to leave) Oh, I should... um...
George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you?
(laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)
I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.
Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)
(rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?
How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)
Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!
She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
George I need to freshen., George, George, George ...
And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!
Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.
I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that.
No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to do.
No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!
Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.
Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!
(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving.
Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)
By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya?
A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.
Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
