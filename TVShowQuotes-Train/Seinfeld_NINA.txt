Well, I really love that piece.
Don't you think that's strange?
But, they're still friends.
Heh.. yeah.
(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?
(Getting ready to leave) Oh, I should... um...
Bye. (Leaves)
Oh, are you interested?
She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya?
Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
(From Jerry's room) Jerry?
My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.
Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!
A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.
Are you an art-lover?
And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!
What's the appeal of the posse?
No... not really. You?
Hi.
It's great talkin'
Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
What are you doing here George?
Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.
Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!
How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)
Honestly, George, the money's not important.
(laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)
Nice to meet you, too.
Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)
George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.
Ah, I gotta go. (Gets up to leave)
Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.
Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.
I don't know... maybe.
Tell me about Elaine.
Yeah.
Oh. Hi.
Really?
I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that.
Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
Hello, George.
Will you excuse me.
(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving.
No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!
Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to do.
Mmmm mm so good.
Elaine?
I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.
Good, good.
(Casually) Alright.. Neither.
Oh, I'm so full.
I just need to freshen up.
George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you?
Yeah!
