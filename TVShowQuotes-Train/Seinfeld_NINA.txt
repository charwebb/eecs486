A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.
I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like that.
Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!
She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
(Getting ready to leave) Oh, I should... um...
No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to do.
Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
(gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?
Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.
(laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)
No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!
By the way, you never said anything to George about Jerry and me, did ya?
How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)
(laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do this if you keep moving.
(rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?
My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.
Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
George, you've been wearing those boots since I met you. You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, are you?
Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.
Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
Ah, I gotta go. (Gets up to leave)
Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)
Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!
Will you excuse me I've got to freshen up.
Mmm, Mmmm oh, so good, mmm, mmm. Aren't you hungry?
And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!
