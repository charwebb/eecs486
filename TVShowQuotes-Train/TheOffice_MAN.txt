I liked your statement tonight.
See you later.
There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there?
Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing over there?
Eh, you go through a lot of mice.
I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday.
So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you?
I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions?
Do you mind if we share this bale?
Oh, very cool.  It was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed by that.
Oh, no. [chuckles] Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse.
No, no, no, I wasn't--I was just laughing at your joke.
Yeah. Little hat.
Yeah, sure, go ahead.
It's very.
Go ahead and read it, some people weren't here.
Quit it.
Pay Place.
Do you have a card?
Hello?
No.
OK, let's make ten copies of this diary.
Thank You.
What does this have to do with sales?
Who is Mr. Scott?
Hey! Lincoln's starting. [light applause]

Why?
Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting.
Uh, I don't know. It's pretty quiet.
These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass.
That's humorous.
Hey! It���s Andy Bernard!
Hey, you're the Scranton guy.
She's got it up now.
He asked for a line, like in a play.
Fine.  Please be brief.
Excuse me.
Kay. 'Kay.
Eleven, sure. And we'll break for lunch, so everyone can have a look.
So did the merger go smoothly, or?
Then you're an old hand at this.
Eh, you know, it really doesn���t make sense to name the mice. They���re kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You���re not one of those PETA guys , are you? [cat jumps off dog] Oh, great.
Yeah.
