She's got it up now.
I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions?
Who is Mr. Scott?
Hey, you're the Scranton guy.
Then you're an old hand at this.
Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence.
Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing over there?
Eh, you go through a lot of mice.
Kay. 'Kay.
Hey! It���s Andy Bernard!
There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there?
No.
We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.
Go ahead and read it, some people weren't here.
I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday.

Oh, no. [chuckles] Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse.
Thank You.
My wife passed away a few years ago.
Yeah.
Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting.
Excuse me.

Hey! Lincoln's starting. [light applause]

See you later.
Uh, I don't know. It's pretty quiet.
