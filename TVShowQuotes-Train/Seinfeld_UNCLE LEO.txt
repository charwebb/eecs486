You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?
I am calm.
I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait!
Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation, you understand?
Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.
They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.
It was a fireball.
Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin.
Hello!
I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.
Hello Amy.
You know Jeffrey's favorite animal the leopard.
It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
What should I do with it?
Come on in.
Jerry, are you listening to this?
What kind of checks?
So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
Okay. Opening.
I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
She left.
What are you talking about?
Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!
What are you talking about?
Hello.
I want-
Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?
What?
When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print.
Helloooo!
Jeffrey went out tonight.
Elaine. Hello. What are you doing here?
Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?
But she's an anti-Semite.
Elaine...
No, for the walking tours.
Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.
She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
Hey Danny. Hello. How are you?
Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .
What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
I want you to have it!
Haven't I always been a good uncle?
Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello!
Elaine what about my eyebrows?
Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw.
Jerry? Hello.
Jerry!
No. I am going to ask him about my eyebrows.
Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.
I got your package.
Are my eyebrows going to grow back?
What are you talking about?
Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of "The Mikado". I want you to go see it with me.
Jerry, take the money!
Jerry, would you please take it.
Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.
She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?
Demeanor?
You're not my nurse.
Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em.
Ah, she's a real tiger.
