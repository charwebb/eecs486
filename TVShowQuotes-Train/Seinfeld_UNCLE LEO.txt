What are you talking about?
What are you writing?
Jerry? Hello.
I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.
They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.
Hey Danny. Hello. How are you?
Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.
Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.
She left.
She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
What kind of checks?
Come on in.
What are you talking about?
It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
Are my eyebrows going to grow back?
Elaine what about my eyebrows?
Move back with Lydia?
Jerry, are you listening to this?
Jerry!
Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
No. I am going to ask him about my eyebrows.
You know Jeffrey's favorite animal the leopard.
I want-
Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin.
It was a fireball.
Hello!
But she's an anti-Semite.
Jerry, take the money!
Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?
You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?
Elaine...
I am calm.
I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!
Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello!
I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait!
He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets.
What should I do with it?
Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?
Haven't I always been a good uncle?
What are you talking about?
Demeanor?
I got your package.
So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
You're not my nurse.
I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
Helloooo!
She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions...
Hello.
Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em.
Your wife?
When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print.
What?
I want you to have it!
I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!
Elaine. Hello. What are you doing here?
Hello Amy.
Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of "The Mikado". I want you to go see it with me.
Ah, she's a real tiger.
Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.
Okay. Opening.
Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .
Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation, you understand?
