Jerry? Hello.
Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.
Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation, you understand?
Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.
Elaine. Hello. What are you doing here?
You know Jeffrey's favorite animal the leopard.
Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?
What are you writing?
Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of "The Mikado". I want you to go see it with me.
Your wife?
It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
Hello Amy.
She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.
I want-
So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
What are you talking about?
Hey Danny. Hello. How are you?
Jeffrey went out tonight.
What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
Jerry, are you listening to this?
I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait!
Helloooo!
Elaine...
Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello!
Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?
Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .
That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions...
What are you talking about?
Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.
Move back with Lydia?
Haven't I always been a good uncle?
Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?
Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin.
No, for the walking tours.
I got your package.
Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.
What kind of checks?
Demeanor?
Are my eyebrows going to grow back?
What?
I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!
I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!
Come on in.
Hello.
Jerry, take the money!
Okay. Opening.
She left.
Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw.
But she's an anti-Semite.
No. I am going to ask him about my eyebrows.
You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?
What should I do with it?
Elaine what about my eyebrows?
He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets.
You're not my nurse.
What are you talking about?
I am calm.
I want you to have it!
Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?
I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.
When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print.
