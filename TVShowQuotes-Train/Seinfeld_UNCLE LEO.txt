Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?
No. I am going to ask him about my eyebrows.
I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch with him? They became friends!
That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions...
Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?
She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin.
She's had quite a day but she's gonna watch you tonight on the TV.
It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of "The Mikado". I want you to go see it with me.
What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .
Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.
I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!
Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?
Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em.
Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.
Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?
Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation, you understand?
You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?
I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, there's my bus! (Rushes out.) Hello! Wait!
I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.
Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.
He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets.
Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
