You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends me an invitation?
What are you talking about?
Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.
Jerry? Hello.
I want-
You know Jeffrey's favorite animal the leopard.
Hell do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, thats your cousin.
Elaine what about my eyebrows?
Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that uh he's very sorry and uh he hopes you'll forgive 'em.
Hello!
Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?
Move back with Lydia?
Come on in.
I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
Hello.
Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. Theyre transferring him to Riverside - so hell completely revamp that operation, you understand?
I wanted to tell you that your grandmother is fine.
Okay. Opening.
Haven't I always been a good uncle?
They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.
Hey Danny. Hello. How are you?
I came to pick her up for a doctor's appointment, she wasn't here. I called the doctor, nobody knows where she is. She hasn't left the apartment in twenty-five years!
Demeanor?
Jerry!
Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.
I am calm.
Hello Amy.
Your grandmother's on a very fixed income. What, are you broke?
So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.
You're not my nurse.
When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. I used to encourage him to print.
It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a week.
No, for the walking tours.
Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way, I can't see a flaw.
Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
What should I do with it?
But she's an anti-Semite.
What?
I got your package.
What kind of checks?
I want you to have it!
Jerry, take the money!
That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have dinner together, they have discussions...
What are you talking about?
Thats exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours hes talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?
It was a fireball.
What are you talking about?
She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
Jerry, would you please take it.
Ah, she's a real tiger.
Chemical?! She hasn't used that account since her branch closed. What are you doing cashing her checks anyway?
What are you writing?
Listen, I don't want to alarm you, but your nana is missing.
Elaine. Hello. What are you doing here?
Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello!
What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that the seats aren't very good.
Your wife?
Elaine...
Why didn't you tell me you were a little short? Here. If anybody asks you where you got it, you don't know.
Jerry, are you listening to this?
Jeffrey went out tonight.
She left.
Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .
Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em.
Helloooo!
