Bye [kiss]...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.
My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?

It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.
Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
[sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?
[to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.
