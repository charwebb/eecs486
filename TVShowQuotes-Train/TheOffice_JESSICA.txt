OK.
Did you not...
Dive in right here.
Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy?
Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
Hey.
Andy! Hey!
Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.
Oh! [laughs] Oof!
Whoo!
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
Ah..[laughs]
Oh.
OK [laughs] Bye.
That's uh, that's the girl you dated.
I can't say it doesn't make sense...
Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.
[laughs] Thank you.
I cannot believe it either.
No, she, she seems fine.
My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
You guys ready?
It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Here we go! [knocks Erin over] Yes!
Spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh]
[knocks Erin off Dwight's shoulders] Yes!
Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?
I'll see you at home?
Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?
Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office.
Oh
No, show me.
Okay. You don't know what you're doing.
OK
I'll let him know.
What?
[sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?
Go away.
Yeah!
[looks at pool] Wow.
Yeah, come on!
[to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.
Uh, yeah. What is it?
Hey.
I dunno.
Hi.
You're breaking up with me?
