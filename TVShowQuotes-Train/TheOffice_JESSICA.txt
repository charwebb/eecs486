Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy?
No, she, she seems fine.
OK [laughs] Bye.
My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
Did you not...
Okay. You don't know what you're doing.
Yeah!
What?
Here we go! [knocks Erin over] Yes!
[sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?
Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
No, show me.
What are you doing here?
Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?
Oh! [laughs] Oof!
You're breaking up with me?
Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?
Oh.
Whoo!
Hey.
Dive in right here.
[to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.
Bye [kiss]...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.
Oh.
Andy! Hey!
It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Oh
Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
That's uh, that's the girl you dated.
Uh huh.
Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office.
Go away.
You guys ready?
[looks at pool] Wow.
Spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh]
[knocks Erin off Dwight's shoulders] Yes!
Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.
I'll let him know.
I'll see you at home?
Hey.
OK
I can't say it doesn't make sense...
Um, it ta-, um it depends.
Uh, yeah. What is it?
Hi.
[laughs] Thank you.
Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.
Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap]
Ah..[laughs]
[group laughing] I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful...
