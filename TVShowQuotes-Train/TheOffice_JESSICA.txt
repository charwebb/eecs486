I'll see you at home?
Okay. You don't know what you're doing.
Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?
Uh, yeah. What is it?
Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.
Um, it ta-, um it depends.
It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Oh.
Hey.
Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?
Bye [kiss]...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.
Dive in right here.
Did you not...
[laughs] Thank you.
You're breaking up with me?
Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy?
Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office.
I dunno.
You guys ready?
Whoo!
Uh huh.
What?
I'll let him know.
Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.
Andy! Hey!
Here we go! [knocks Erin over] Yes!
[looks at pool] Wow.
Oh! [laughs] Oof!
Oh
That's uh, that's the girl you dated.
[knocks Erin off Dwight's shoulders] Yes!
I can't say it doesn't make sense...
[to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.
Yeah, come on!
Ah..[laughs]
OK.
My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
What are you doing here?
No, show me.
Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
No, she, she seems fine.
Spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh]
I cannot believe it either.
Yeah!
[sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?
Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap]
OK
OK [laughs] Bye.
