[group laughing] I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful...
[to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.
Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
[sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?
Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.
Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?
Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
Bye [kiss]...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.
My brother and I were the chicken fight champions of our swim club growing up. I mean, we beat the Strauss twins. Ok, I guess somebody didn't grow up in west Hartford, Connecticut.
