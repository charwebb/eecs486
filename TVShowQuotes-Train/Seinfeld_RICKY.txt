Oh, 'kay, see. On this particular Tuesday (he swaps seats and sits beside Elaine) you could've watched six hours of Lucy. There's I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy.
TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.
Hey, you can't talk to her like that.
(entering) Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide.
Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train.
(jumping to his feet) Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious.
(seeing TV) Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching?
These are worth like, a lot of money.
(after Elaine) Hey miss! (waving TV Guide) You forgot this!
I like the special fall preview issues the best.
Fine, okay. It's just, I've never seen a beautiful lady reading 'the Guide' so far away from a TV. You must really like television.
