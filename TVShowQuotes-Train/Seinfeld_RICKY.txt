Hey, you can't talk to her like that.
(jumping to his feet) Elaine! Hello! You look scrumptious.
These are worth like, a lot of money.
Fine, okay. It's just, I've never seen a beautiful lady reading 'the Guide' so far away from a TV. You must really like television.
(entering) Oh, 'cos I made her this very special gift. 'Kay, it's a bouquet of paper from her TV Guide.
(seeing TV) Hey, is that the Twilight Zone you're watching?
(after Elaine) Hey miss! (waving TV Guide) You forgot this!
I like the special fall preview issues the best.
Guess your boyfriend'll have to catch the next train.
TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.
To highlight the programmes you plan to watch.
