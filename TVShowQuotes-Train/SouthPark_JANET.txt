Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something.
Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.
It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.
I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!
Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?
Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!
We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!
The school hired a substitute to cover for me.
Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!
Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! 
Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?
Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!
We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."
That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman.
Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian.
What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?
Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!
Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?
I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.
Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.
All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.
Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!
No, it's Les Bos!  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!
And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.
The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!
Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.
All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.
Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!
Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.
That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!
Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.
If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!
Because we're protecting the only home we have.
No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos!
