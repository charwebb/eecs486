Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!

Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?

Hey Tracy, hey Kate.

Would you allow straight people in? Men?

I knew it! I knew it!

Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!

The school hired a substitute to cover for me.

Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!

That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman.

Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!

Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? 

I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!

No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! 

That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!

Take positions, Lesbos!

Yeah, this is our home.

Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.

The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!

It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.

Yeah, scissor!

If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!

Hey Patty.

No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.

He-yeah. Done what?

Persians?!

Lesbos! Positions! 

Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.

Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.

Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.

Let them through. It's okay.

Lesbohhhs!

Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!

Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!

All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.

Yeah, I've been told that.

All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.

Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?

But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa. 

Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.

I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.

Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! 

Choose your next words wisely, Persian! 

¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!

Because we're protecting the only home we have.

What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?

A-are you sure?

Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!

Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something.

Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian.

Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!

I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.

Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!

Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?

Oh jeez. 

Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!

And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.

Thanks for everything, Xerxes.
