Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.

Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!

Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian.

Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!

And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.

Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something.

That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!

Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! 

It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.

That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman.

No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! 

We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."

Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.

No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.

No, it's Les Bos!  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!

Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? 

The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!

Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!

I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!

We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!

Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?

¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.

I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.

All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.

You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.

Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!

The school hired a substitute to cover for me.

Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!

Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!

What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?

If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!

Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?

I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.

Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.

Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?

Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.

All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
