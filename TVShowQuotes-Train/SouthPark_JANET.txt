I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.
And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.
The school hired a substitute to cover for me.
That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman.
Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!
You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.
That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!
We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."
It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.
Because we're protecting the only home we have.
No, it's Les Bos!  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!
It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?
All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.
If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!
Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!
Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.
Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!
Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!
Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian.
Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!
Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?
I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!
Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something.
What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?
Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!
Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.
Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? 
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?
Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!
Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.
No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.
No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! 
Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! 
All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.
The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!
