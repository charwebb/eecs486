That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman.

All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.

All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.

Persians?!

Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.

Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.

Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something.

He-yeah. Done what?

Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! 

Thanks for everything, Xerxes.

Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!

Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?

I knew it! I knew it!

But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa. 

You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.

The school hired a substitute to cover for me.

Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!

Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!

No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! 

Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? 

Never!

What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?

Hey Patty.

Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!

Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.

Because we're protecting the only home we have.

Yeah, this is our home.

Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian.

I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.

It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.

Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.

Would you allow straight people in? Men?

I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!

No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.

Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!

Yeah, I've been told that.

Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!

Hey Tracy, hey Kate.

Lesbos! Positions! 

The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!

Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!

Oh jeez. 

We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."

Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!

If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!

We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!

And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.

Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?

A-are you sure?

Let them through. It's okay.

Choose your next words wisely, Persian! 

Take positions, Lesbos!

It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.

Yeah, scissor!

Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.

Lesbohhhs!

Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!

We can't? I think it's pretty fun.
