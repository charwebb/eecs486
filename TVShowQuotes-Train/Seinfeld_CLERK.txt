6.75.
There is no small. [flash of perky inspiration] Child-size is small.
Uh, this is out. Someone has it.
49?
I thought you said you wanted to be out?
You poor thing!
Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.)
Yes?
Here you Mr. Costanza.
Thatll be 13.05
A hundred? I can't change that.
Oh! Well, we have quite a few to pick from ( turns around and picks up a huge binder) They're arranged in order of price , the most expensive are in the front.
(on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh, I see. (listens) Interesting. (listens) Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you.
When 's the wedding?
That's what I said. $98.00.
The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...
Here you are. (hands Elaine the cake box)
Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years. I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check.
Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...
You're a good friend.
Can I getca anything else?
Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.
That's medium.
There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.
Looks real, doesn't it?
Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?
All right guys, take it outside.
46?
That'll be $98.00.
(on phone) Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh, there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project?
That, Cinnamon Babka.
(blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here.
Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.
Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... "A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...
Keep going.
Okay, have you been in here before?
Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?
Not enough.
(Noticing George with the rocking chair) Excuse me. Can I help you?
There is no small. Small is Medium.
(apologetically) Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home.
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.
Can I help you guys with anything?
What's your name again?
I know! But it happens.
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
Oh, sorry. We can't do that.
Adult.
Hi.. May I help you?
Next.
Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good.
I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.
Well, maybe I will.
That would be $387 round-trip.
Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.
Yes.
Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)
You're paying for these.
Nope, haven't seen him.
You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
Uh, what are you returning?
You got to buy more than that.
47!
Do you want butter?
Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo.
Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.
Then you better get a camera.
Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.
Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo.
58!
Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.
What project?
What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
You've really lost a lot of hair.
You're gonna have to fill me in.
Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49.
Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout.
... flared nostrils?
Oh, I'm very sorry.
[perkily] It's yellow!
(coughing and coughing, getting really bad)
Ohh! Well...Congratulations
(upset) Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to humiliate me about it, alright!
