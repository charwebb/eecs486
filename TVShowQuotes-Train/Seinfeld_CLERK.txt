What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.
Yes.
You have to take a number.
That's medium.
I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.
Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.
You poor thing!
[perkily] It's butter-*flavored*!
(coughing and coughing, getting really bad)
Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.
(blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here.
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.
Not enough.

Then you better get a camera.
You got to buy more than that.

Uh, what are you returning?
Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?
I know! But it happens.
All right guys, take it outside.

(on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh, I see. (listens) Interesting. (listens) Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you.

The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...
I thought you said you wanted to be out?
[chuckling] Not usually.
You're paying for these.
You're a good friend.
(apologetically) Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home.
Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.
Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...
Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49.
Nope, haven't seen him.
There is no small. Small is Medium.
