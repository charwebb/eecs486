That, Cinnamon Babka.
Ohh! Well...Congratulations
Here you Mr. Costanza.
Nope, haven't seen him.
Evan Fayne.
Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)
Right, how did that all work out?
... flared nostrils?
(Noticing George with the rocking chair) Excuse me. Can I help you?
You got to buy more than that.
Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.
(on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh, I see. (listens) Interesting. (listens) Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you.
Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.)
A hundred? I can't change that.
Next.
Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo.
That'll be $98.00.
There is no small. [flash of perky inspiration] Child-size is small.
You poor thing!
Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.
Okay, have you been in here before?
Uh, that'll be, uh... $3.49.
Do you want butter?
Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.
I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.
What project?
You're paying for these.
That's what I said. $98.00.
Oh, I'm very sorry.
You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
I know! But it happens.
6.75.
You've really lost a lot of hair.
Then you better get a camera.
That's medium.
Not enough.
Uh, what are you returning?
Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good.
Oh! Well, we have quite a few to pick from ( turns around and picks up a huge binder) They're arranged in order of price , the most expensive are in the front.
(upset) Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to humiliate me about it, alright!
Adult.
What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.
Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?
Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout.
58!
Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.
Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.
Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... "A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...
That would be $387 round-trip.
(coughing and coughing, getting really bad)
You're gonna have to fill me in.
When 's the wedding?
You have to take a number.
47!
Can I help you guys with anything?
46?
(apologetically) Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home.
Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky.
[perkily] It's butter-*flavored*!
All right guys, take it outside.
The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...
There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.
Oh, sorry. We can't do that.
Keep going.
Well, maybe I will.
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.
There is no small. Small is Medium.
How about a nice box of "scram".
(blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here.
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
You're a good friend.
Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.
Here you are. (hands Elaine the cake box)
Yes.
Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years. I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check.
Uh, this is out. Someone has it.
(checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.
Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?
Hi.. May I help you?
(on phone) Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh, there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project?
[chuckling] Not usually.
What's your name again?
