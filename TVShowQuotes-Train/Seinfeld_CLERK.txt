You're paying for these.
[perkily] It's yellow!
(checks computer again) Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.
Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.
Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good.
Next.
(Noticing George with the rocking chair) Excuse me. Can I help you?
What is it a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.
Well, I could put it on reserve for you, if you'd like.
That would be $387 round-trip.
I don't think so. It doesn't work that way.
Yes, yes, we do need documentation or you know, people could take advantage.
Ah, ``Rochelle, Rochelle''... "A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk"...
Yes.
Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...(she flips the sample book all the way to the end.)
What's your name again?
58!
Oh! Well, we have quite a few to pick from ( turns around and picks up a huge binder) They're arranged in order of price , the most expensive are in the front.
(on phone) Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh, there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project?
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.
That's medium.
Sign right here, please. (hands over clipboard)
Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky.
Yes, all you have to do is pay the full fare now, then return to any one of our counters with a copy of the death certificate, and we'll refund half your fare.
6.75.
Here you Mr. Costanza.
Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?
Here you are. (hands Elaine the cake box)
Oh, sorry. We can't do that.
There's chocolate and there's cinnamon.
Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout.
Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?
Oh, I'm very sorry.
Kramer.... (checks computer) All right...
What project?
Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo.
(coughing and coughing, getting really bad)
A hundred? I can't change that.
(upset) Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to humiliate me about it, alright!
Keep going.
Yes?
Uh, what are you returning?
When 's the wedding?
Okay, have you been in here before?
Nope, haven't seen him.
Well, you didn't rewind it. There's a $2.00 charge for not rewinding.
Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.
(apologetically) Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home.
Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years. I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check.
Right, how did that all work out?
Evan Fayne.
Ohh! Well...Congratulations
You have to take a number.
You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo.
Do you want butter?
[perkily] It's butter-*flavored*!
Hi.. May I help you?
(on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh, I see. (listens) Interesting. (listens) Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you.
You're gonna have to fill me in.
The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...
Then you better get a camera.
Looks real, doesn't it?
I know! But it happens.
That's what I said. $98.00.
[chuckling] Not usually.
You've really lost a lot of hair.
Adult.
(blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here.
You're a good friend.
You poor thing!
47!
Thatll be 13.05
You got to buy more than that.
Uh, this is out. Someone has it.
That, Cinnamon Babka.
How about a nice box of "scram".
There is no small. [flash of perky inspiration] Child-size is small.
There is no small. Small is Medium.
That'll be $98.00.
Can I getca anything else?
Well, maybe I will.
