Are you sure you should be going on this thing?

Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick!  Oh, my stuhomach!  Oh, my nose!  Augh! 

What's cock Magic?

Kenny?

Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.

Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on.

Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!

Jesus. It's begun.

How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!

God Damn-it.

Yeah?

What's the point? Can't you see it's over? 

We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. 

No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.

Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old men—I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! 

Wha, what's the matter, doctor?

Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.

Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.

God.

Aw, he smacked me in the balls! 

Kenny?? 

Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!

You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.

I don't go to any cock Magic fights!

Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! 

Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.

'Cause he's Bono, that's why.

Hey, I heard that, bitch!

Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.

We can be a nation that believe in war,

Aagh!

Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.

What do you mean?

When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless.

I'm white trash and I'm in trouble. 

Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! 

NOW!

Yep, me too.

Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it!  Good job. Now throw me one.  Ohp! Guhhogh! 

Where were the teachers?!

What—What did you say?

Aw, alright.

Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.

See you in a couple of days, son.

Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one.

What happened? What killed him, doctor?

What the hell is he wearin' now?

No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.

Well, now, that's part of the fun.

How is it?

Oohhh, God!  Oooh, my balls!  Ooh, God 

Now don't make me do that again! 

What? Whaaat?!

A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. 

Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son.

Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants! 

We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!

Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids-- 

Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! 

You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.

Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. 

Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much.  Man.

Oh yeah.

We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.

If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!

Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?

Nice! Oh yeah! 

Beer?

Hey hefe. You want some cerveza? 

Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!

Well, I can still drink. 

Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.

You're hurting my arm!

Uh huh!

We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.

Aww hell, I'm sorry, too. 

It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive.

A football? That's amazing.

Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny!

What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?

Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.

What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! 

Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey. 

What? I'm just askin' a question.  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!

You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!

Me, too.

You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.

I heard that.

You're hurting me!

He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?

Oh my freaking Lord.

We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio.

Yeah. Now they're acting like men.

Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? 

What the hell was that?

I'm tired of losing this battle!

Eeaagghh! 

Shut up, bitch!

It's a lot of natural.

Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!

Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house.

With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?

Oh my God, it killed Kenny!

Well your side has the grocery store.

Oh!

I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!

'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!

Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?

That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!

Yes?

What did he say?  ...John Denver Experience.

Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.

Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas?

Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us , and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.

Uh!

Tackle box?

So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?

Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!

I told you to shut up!

We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV. 

God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.

Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.

I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.

Not that easy. You were lucky.

Who the hell could that be? 

Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?

Your wife, huh?

Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo.

Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. 

Come on, son!

I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??

That's where I live now.

Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock.

We're fine, officer.
