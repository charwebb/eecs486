Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!
What? I'm just askin' a question.  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!
That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! 
We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. 
If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!
Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! 
No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.
Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?
Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!
What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! 
Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys?  Kenny?! Answer me!! 
We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.
Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!
Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey. 
Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!
Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! 
Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. 
You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.
Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?
Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?
Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.
Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? 
Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.
You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!
Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids-- 
With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.
Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old menâ€”I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! 
How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!
Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.
I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??
Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.
I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.
What's the point? Can't you see it's over? 
Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of...  Who-o-oa.
So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?
Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us , and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.
We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.
A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. 
Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny!
Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much.  Man.
If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!
You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.
Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it!  Good job. Now throw me one.  Ohp! Guhhogh! 
No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.
We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
We can be a nation that believe in war,
I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!
And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!
We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV. 
Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.
Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!
Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!
I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.
You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!
God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.
See you in a couple of days, son.
