Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!

We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!

Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.

You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!

A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. 

That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!

Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.

No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.

Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.

Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.

How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!

Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. 

'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!

What's the point? Can't you see it's over? 

With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?

Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us , and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.

Are you sure you should be going on this thing?

You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.

Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.

I don't go to any cock Magic fights!

Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much.  Man.

Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!

See you in a couple of days, son.

--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.

Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?

Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.

We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.

I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.

Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.

Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.

Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. 

You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.

Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?

If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!

Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?

We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV. 

He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?

We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.

And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!

Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! 

Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on.

If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!

God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.

We can be a nation that believe in war,

Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!

Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son.

What? I'm just askin' a question.  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!

You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.

Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.

I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??

We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. 

Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.

Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!

Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick!  Oh, my stuhomach!  Oh, my nose!  Augh! 

Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys?  Kenny?! Answer me!! 

I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!

So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?

Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it!  Good job. Now throw me one.  Ohp! Guhhogh! 

Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!

Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old menâ€”I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! 

Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of...  Who-o-oa.

Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey. 

Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!

Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? 

Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! 

Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.
