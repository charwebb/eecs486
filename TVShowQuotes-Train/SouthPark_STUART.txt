We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!
What's the point? Can't you see it's over? 
Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!
How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!
Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick!  Oh, my stuhomach!  Oh, my nose!  Augh! 
--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.
Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.
Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!
Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey. 
Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. 
Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old menâ€”I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! 
I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!
Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?
We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. 
No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.
A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. 
Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.
Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids-- 
Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
See you in a couple of days, son.
That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! 
We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?
We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.
And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!
You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.
Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!
Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.
I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.
Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son.
Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.
What? I'm just askin' a question.  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!
Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?
Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.
Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much.  Man.
I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??
Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.
Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys?  Kenny?! Answer me!! 
Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.
Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!
Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on.
We can be a nation that believe in war,
Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! 
Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us , and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.
What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! 
Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? 
Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?
'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!
If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!
Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny!
No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.
Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.
Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!
If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!
Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. 
God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.
I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.
You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell!
