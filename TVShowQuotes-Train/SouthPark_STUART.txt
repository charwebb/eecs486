Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on.
Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!
Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny!
I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!
Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys?  Kenny?! Answer me!! 
We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.
Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.
You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.
Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! 
Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.
That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?
Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!
We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.
You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!
Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.
Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.
No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.
Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old menâ€”I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! 
Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!
We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV. 
Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!
Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of...  Who-o-oa.
Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. 
What's the point? Can't you see it's over? 
See you in a couple of days, son.
Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. 
Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.
Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.
Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey. 
How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!
Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it!  Good job. Now throw me one.  Ohp! Guhhogh! 
You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!
With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?
Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! 
Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids-- 
I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??
Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!
Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? 
Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.
I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.
What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! 
You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. 
Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. 
Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick!  Oh, my stuhomach!  Oh, my nose!  Augh! 
If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!
Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son.
Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?
We can be a nation that believe in war,
Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.
Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much.  Man.
Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?
Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.
We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.
What? I'm just askin' a question.  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!
