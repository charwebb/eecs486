Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.
Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!
How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!
Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? 
Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.
What's the point? Can't you see it's over? 
Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country!  Come on, Kenny!
Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.
I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!
We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV. 
We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! 
Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?
Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!
Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.
We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!
Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.
Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us.  Aw now, honey. 
What? I'm just askin' a question.  You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!
A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. 
Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.
Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! 
See you in a couple of days, son.
We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.
Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!
Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. 
And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!
So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?
Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys?  Kenny?! Answer me!! 
Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!
I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick!  Oh, my stuhomach!  Oh, my nose!  Augh! 
You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son.
Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.
Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. 
No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.
God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.
Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and-  Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much.  Man.
Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?
I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.
You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!
Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it!  Good job. Now throw me one.  Ohp! Guhhogh! 
If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!
He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?
Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.
We can be a nation that believe in war,
With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.
Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids-- 
You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls.  What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of...  Who-o-oa.
Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!
Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us , and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.
I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??
Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.
We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. 
Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! 
--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.
Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.
Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.
