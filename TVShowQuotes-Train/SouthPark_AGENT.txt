How so?

Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso.

Naw, this is better. It's called The Contender. 

We monitored your little online chat.  Now you're coming with us! 

Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her...

Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now. 

Are you Alphonse Mephesto?

Amazing. He looks so much like us. 

What do you mean your client isn't coming?! We're taping the show tomorrow! Where am I goin' to find another contestant? Fine! Go screw yourself!

Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised.

Sir, the feds are here.

Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie! 

Where's the ice man?!

Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chatâ€”now, you're coming with us! 

What? Nothing!

I said, stop that train!

Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go go go! 

This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months.

Habitat?

Well yeah, winner gets a thousand dollars.

Hold it right there, scumbag!

He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?

Nothing.

We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996.

No, that's impossible! How could he have?

Right.

Really?

Stop the train!

Yeah.

We would like to...  we would like to offer our services in your experiments.

Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.

The train! 

I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy.  Seize the assets. 

Mr. President?

Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles. I think you've got real promise. How'd you like to sign with CAA?

Oh, dear Jesus, no!

Hey, we didn't try that room! 

We'll never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance.

Butlutlutlutlup! 

The train station? Then he's trying to go somewhere.

And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this?

Freeze, cows!  The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns! 

Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative.

Hey there my man, that was a great performance.

I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock.

It's easy.

Excuse me? Eric Cartman?

Damn! Well, so much for our plan to use the ice man to take over Sweden.

Great! You kids just saved my ass! See you over at Stage 6. 

We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?

Let's get him! 

Damn it, Damn it!

You will now all march in an orderly fashion into this trailer!  Move! 

Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here!  Go get him, boys!  Cut him off!
