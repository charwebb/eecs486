This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months.
Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her...
Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chatâ€”now, you're coming with us! 
Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.
He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?
Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised.
Naw, this is better. It's called The Contender. 
The train station? Then he's trying to go somewhere.
We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?
Freeze, cows!  The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns! 
Hey there my man, that was a great performance.
I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock.

Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here!  Go get him, boys!  Cut him off!
Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab.
Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now. 
And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this?
We'll never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance.
What do you mean your client isn't coming?! We're taping the show tomorrow! Where am I goin' to find another contestant? Fine! Go screw yourself!
Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso.
