Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.

Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! 

Where are you taking me??  You are all being very naughty. 

You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years.

That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.

No!  Jesus. Jesus!  No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch.

No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit.  What's going on here?!

Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do. 

To bring happiness and joy to the children.

You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old... me. 
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys

And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.

I just couldn't do it.  I just couldn't let him live. He shocked Santa's balls! 

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand!

All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!

I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! 

Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!

Huh?  Oh, all right.  Make way for Santa! 

Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead. Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's... very sad. Santa will have to... oh no. They're coming for me!  Stay back, you bastards! Stay back! 

Oh, and boys, you might want to check under the Christmas tree.  Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! 

I don't know, I live in the North Pole.  What are you doing??

I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it! 

Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh! 

Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!

Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.

I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.

We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.

Well little boy, it seems that you  have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?

You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.

I know, but there's, like, three-hundred Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones! It's not fair! Just do it yourself! I'm leaving. 

Everyone! Everyone, can I please have your attention?  Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day. we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus.

Up on the housetop, click click click.
Down through the chimney with good old... me.

Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone!  Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all!

Then we're in for a long night, 'cause I don't know shit!
