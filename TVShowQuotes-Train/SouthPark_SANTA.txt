Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh! 
Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.
I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! 
No!  Jesus. Jesus!  No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch.
You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.
Oh, and boys, you might want to check under the Christmas tree.  Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! 
Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.
And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.
You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years.
Where are you taking me??  You are all being very naughty. 
I just couldn't do it.  I just couldn't let him live. He shocked Santa's balls! 
Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.
I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it! 
Then we're in for a long night, 'cause I don't know shit! 
Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!
We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.
Up on the housetop, click click click.
Down through the chimney with good old... me.
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand!
Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! 
I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.
Huh?  Oh, all right.  Make way for Santa! 
Okay, Jesus. Here's one you might remember:
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twistin' through the dusty land.
All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!
Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead. Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's... very sad. Santa will have to... oh no. They're coming for me!  Stay back, you bastards! Stay back! 
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!
You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old... me. 
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys
Well little boy, it seems that you  have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?
Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do. 
That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.
Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone!  Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all!
I don't know, I live in the North Pole.  What are you doing??
Everyone! Everyone, can I please have your attention?  Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day. we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus.
