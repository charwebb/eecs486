Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead. Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's... very sad. Santa will have to... oh no. They're coming for me!  Stay back, you bastards! Stay back! 

Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus! 

Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone!  Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all!

Christmas is for giving!

Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!

Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.

Don't do it, Kyle! 

Little boy, you should be ashamed!

What? What happened?

I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.

Jesus Christ! 

You're right, kid. 

Aw.

And heaven and nature sing...

Holy crap! 

Howdy-ho ho ho!

Huh?  Oh, all right.  Make way for Santa! 

Okay, Jesus. Here's one you might remember:
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twistin' through the dusty land.

Hold on!  Sleigh is going down! 

Well little boy, it seems that you  have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?

Come on, kids! 

I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it! 

But I brought some corn for poopity-poppin'.

Merry Christmas! Hohoho!

You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years.

And heaven and nature sing...

No!  Jesus. Jesus!  No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch.

Where are you taking me??  You are all being very naughty. 

Ho ho ho! 

We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.

To bring happiness and joy to the children.

Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!

North Pole. This is Santa.

Hohoho! Merry Christmas! 

Oh, and boys, you might want to check under the Christmas tree.  Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! 

Then we're in for a long night, 'cause I don't know shit! 

I don't know, I live in the North Pole.  What are you doing??

Merry Christmas!  I'm hit! I'm hit! 

Santa Cl- em

Everyone! Everyone, can I please have your attention?  Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day. we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus.

I know, but there's, like, three-hundred Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones! It's not fair! Just do it yourself! I'm leaving. 

Saint Nicholas... can't think of one.

Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!

Up on the housetop, click click click.
Down through the chimney with good old... me.

Oh no. Not Santa's balls! 

Well, since I've no place to go.

Santa's legs are broken. 

We sure did, Jesus.

You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old... me. 
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys

I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! 

No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit.  What's going on here?!

What?

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand!

I'm here, Jesus.

And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.

Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! 

I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.

Sorry, boys. I tried.

You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.

Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.

Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.

Go away??

I'm gonna fucking kill you!

Uh.

Hey, it's my turn.

Hello, everybody!

Aw, fuck you, Jesus!

Where away?

All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!
