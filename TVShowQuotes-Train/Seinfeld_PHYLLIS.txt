It's really cute.
Put it down
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
You sound worried.
Um, The DaVinci Code.
[grabbing the coffee] Hot!
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
Now you move on.
I... twisted it.
We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
[out of breath] Bowling.
If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
[to Pam] I'll tell you later.
Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
We have a gym at home. It���s called the bedroom.
[gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
You're making a knife with a knife?
Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
You didn't decorate it?
Jim, don't listen to Andy.  I think it's so romantic.
Oh Michael.
I'll do it.
Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
Why would you do that?
Why are you here, Todd?
[to customer] Can you help me?
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
Did you get any clients back?
It's unbelievable!
One, two three! [group takes shots]
It's a secret.
A lot of mines in Scranton.
Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
[on phone] Well, who can do a party of this size?  But you're in the business, you must surely know of some other businesses.  Okay, well, I JUST WANT A DAMN DANCE FLOOR!  Sorry. So sorry, I shouldn't have sworn, I'm so sorry.  Um, thanks for your time. [knock on door]  What?  Sorry, I shouldn't have said 'what' like that, it was really rude.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
What?
Oh. Someplace with a pool, then?
That wasn't me.
See?
Poor, poor Andy.
Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
I invited someone to the party. Bob Vance. He works at Vance Refrigeration next door. That's how we met. [whispers] He's my boyfriend.
Disgusting...
Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
[laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
I was...
Mmm-hmm.
Dwight said it's 'Hog maw.'
I'm just saying hi to Bob.
I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
It's just me here.
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
No, I think they mean more like a politician.
Sir, you have some messages.
Why wouldn't she?
Did you have a nice drive in?
Where would you like the Rice Krispy Treat stars?
Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
[raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.
I think you're remembering that wrong?
Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
Guys, we can���t let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
You don't even like us as friends?
Wait���.they���re terrified?
Oh God.
Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
Yeah.
Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.
Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
[moans in pain]
[singing] Here I go again on my own.  Going down the only road I've ever known...
[laughs] Yeah.
Yes.
I almost quit my job so I could be closer to Bob, and we're in the same building.
[under her breath] There's another party in the break room.
[snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
He was looking at me in the ladies' room.
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
Okay, let's do it.
Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
Oh, don't be such a baby.
Why were you peering over the stalls?!
Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
I think it's good.
[at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
Are you calling me a ho?
I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
You said fruit, Michael.
The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Stanley and I are close, too.
Yeah.
It's not me, either.
Is there any mustard?
Cool.
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
Okay... [removes glasses]
Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.
Oh...
She's out of your league Andy.
Oh, ok.
So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
Oh, this isn't good.
Where do we get those?
Ooh.
Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
Sugarplum fairy wands.
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
Ohhh...
He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
I'm sitting right here Dwight.
Whew, well. I guess that���s that.
Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
That's fair.
Tom?  He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's shooting herself in the head] Pow.
I need you to get rid of the tree.
You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
Michael, what happened?
[also to Darryl] Good morning.
Then what was this all about?
Yeah.
Oh.
Pam.
Where are we going?
Good luck!
I think he-
Who's that?
I have a sports bra.
What are you gonna do?
No.
Does it hurt terribly?
Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.
She does have very nice clothes.
What's happening to you Michael?
Thank you, Michael.
No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
How far along is Pam?
I think it's gonna be Michael.
Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.
It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
Where are we going this afternoon?
I can't feel my toes.
OK. Packer can go to hell.
Teri's out of town, Michael.
Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out]
Andy He's gone.
They're not getting married. It's just talk.
So, uh, show us how you���d normally sell to a female client.
It's not like you can fire people or anything.
I'm sorry.  It's the largest one I have.
What does the furnace do?
I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
Kevin, take your shoes off first!
Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
I said no.
Cookies?
First message is: 'I love you'.  That's from me.
Oh, dear.
It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
Yes you were.
An asset!
Just go.
What are you asking?
What? Is Dan okay?
Yeah, I really like Stanley, but I'm not always sure if he likes me. I guess that's okay, 'cause I don't really like him.
It's nice, like Up.
Or should I have corndogs. I mean-
[phone rings] Hello?  Hi Bob Vance. [laughs]
[knocks files off desk] Sorry.
That feels good, Dwight.
What does that even mean?
Oh, that's great news for your friend.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
[into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
Hello Angela.
Sure.
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
That's awful.
Awww, it's kissing its mommy!
Bye everyone.
I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
Wanna dance, Dwight?
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
Yeah mostly.
Make them kiss each other.
I didn't ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is 'Nights in Morocco'.  This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
I think I just got flashed.
Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. [Andy gets up and leaves]
Hey, where���s my ring?
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
We're laughing at this cartoon! [passes newspaper to Dwight]
Where's your place?
What's he doing?
Drew isn't a girl... She's Andy.
It's going well.
Why should I have to thank him?
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
Go get him Bobby!
Dwight was in the ladies' room and he was looking at me.
Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
Michael, you make fun of us every day.
You are a pervert!
We're not mocking, we're watching.
I have my hug.
Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk]
[quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
Found him!
If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
Why isn't Dwight turning around?
I knitted it for you.
[to Kelly] Who's that?
Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your [to Nellie] boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
[laughing] It's good!
Oh, I'd love to but, um-
Okay.
Dwight, get out of here!!
Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
No, he���s good.
Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that���s-.
That's...
I don't have that, Dwight.
Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
No.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, the plants are gonna love this.
What are these for?
Michael, I was doing so well.
Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
Ow! Ee! I sat on my sandwich.
You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
No, she is the boss.
And this brings us to you, little one.
Yeah.
[to Dwight] Do you believe that?!
Michael... [Kelly enters conference room in a flirty red dress]
Mm-hmm, near the river.
What are we supposed to talk about?
You tell me.  Well, you do mean you and Jim right?  Oh God.  I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time.  I'm sorry!
[laughs] Yeah.
Yes. Put the DVD in.
What's wrong with you?
Definitely Jim.
I have ears, Dwight.
Completely.
All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
Val.
Four.
Okay, fine. Cash it is.
So you went homemade this year.
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
I was all-county my junior and senior years.
All right.
What's on your suit?
What does that even mean?
It looks pretty black.
I don't know, they're both handsome.
You are...
Oh no, they're still not done.
Dwight! Dwight!
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
On purpose.
Me.
She's not hot.
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
No. Jim... [wine bottle clangs on plate]
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
Yeah, what's the reason?
But I won't be able to do inventory without it.
Dwight, you can���t go. You have a problem with women. You can���t sell to them.
Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
What in the name of God is going on?!
Yeah.
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
Dwight, stop it.
He should pay.
I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Mmm-hmm. Moneybags. Must be nice.
Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
Oh. [looks away]
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
No. Sorry.
[seeing a large red spot on Michael's lip] God! Wow!
Hello.
You're kidding...
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
You're gonna compete against us?
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
Yeah.
You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.'
[Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
No, it's lettuce.
I don't get it.
Yeah, pretty stationery.
What's the case, Toby?
Yes, I'm jumping.
Ooh, why is it shaped like that?
Oh.
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
Who?
So he won't get caught!
Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
Oh, we wouldn't.  We love Stevie Wonder.
Yeah, that���s all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
Yes.
In our neighborhood...
What should we ask?
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]
You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Mm-hmm.
All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don���t know.
Well, what about the other guys.
Are you all packed?
Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
Dwight, get out of here!
Ass.
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
Got it.
I do.
Did you plan it?
Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
Which thing?
Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
Sic him!
Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
But I didn't report your snoring-
Michael.
When I was a little girl...
That's great!
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
Wow.
Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
Did the police solve the problem with the...
This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
Yeah, there you go. [laughter]
Dwight, get out of here!
Yeah!
Wow, thirteen!
How much wine do you have?
No.
You guys are together?
Angela���s special repairman is here.
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles]
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
You found Uncle Al!
Say 'Me eat cookie.'
Mmm, whatcha got?
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
That's funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date]
Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red...
[dressed as Raggedy Ann] Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.
I'm telling Michael.
Please Michael.
Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
[storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
Are you glad to be back?
What are you -
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
You think that Andy's family owned slaves?
On more week. [chuckles]
Um-hmmm.
Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on]
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
C.C
Hey, this is your apology letter.
I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
[Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face]
Ahhh! [falls out of chair]
I don���t think I should walk anymore.  You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast.  Two poached eggs.  And then half a sandwich on the bus.
Yes I do.
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
Now this is getting ridiculous.
Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
Wait, what?
Okay.
I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
Oh.
Are you alright?
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
You, are, a pervert!
Come on Andy, they're a good match.
You're welcome.
There's nothing to know, it's just gossip.
Yes.
You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.
Do you think they'll get the account. [Stanley stares at her] How come you never answer me?
Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
Oh, sorry, it's your job.
I am jumping.
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that���s Italian.
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Thanks Angela.
Know what?
Yeah.
Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.
We���re gonna cover for you, ya know.
[leaving the room] Excuse me.
[Dwight's footsteps sound from the ceiling] Just drive away. Just..
Hi sweetie.
Cold, huh?
Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]
Let me help you us.
Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
He needs to rest.
It's labeled.
Shut up. You're a freak!
Andy, don���t make us sell this stupid thing.
OK.
Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
I like her purple dress.
I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
You can't be in here!
Okay that's enough.
But where would we...go?
This is weird.
Wow! Sorry!
Hi.
You left me in a bad part of town!
You don���t have to thank us for coming in, it���s our job.
Did you even try?
Unbelievable.
No..we don't
If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Ten...
Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. 'kay.
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
Back!
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
[whispers] I'm clicking!
My mom taught me that.
The girls school?
[whispering] It's about Michael.
David Wallace called this meeting?
Oh, we're in a meeting.
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
Is there any mustard?
Eleven, wow!
Ow, my ankle!
Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.
Was there a fistfight?
[Gasps] Oh my god!
He's always been terrible with money.
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
Ryan, hand the phone over.
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
It���s just the wind.
[whispers] Yes.
Does he die?
Thanks.
Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.
Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It���s hopeless.
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Do you have a black eye?
Yeah, sign says 'Begin tour here.'
What do we do? How do we stop this?
Yeah, I got stung up my dress.
Not according to the beans.
Backups. [Jim goes to join the backups]
I'm sorry,
The first thing I'd buy is new boobs. For my mom. She has the worst boobs. It- It's embarrassing.
Hey.
Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
[to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
Um, let's see... it's fine.
There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
We-- we--
It's my back.
Oh, boy...
You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
Yeah, I would, too.
We already said no.
No, just go home.
I hope he's ok, I feel bad.
I'm bringing someone.
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]
Oh, well, I'm already married.  Boys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses.
Clark!
Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
[to Stanley] Hey, I did good too!
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Elliot.
Excuse me?
Okay, forget it. [walks away]
That's despicable.
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
Why?
We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
You know your perfumes!
Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
Michael! Come on!
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn't be a good wife.
How's your hearing?
Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay.
Mmm-hmm.
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
It'll be all right.
Jim was supposed to collect it.
Andy!
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
I thought it was...
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
What?
We have a right to know.
What did you do, Andy?
[crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
I didn't really get a good look.
We started selling balloons.
I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
And when you fell in, did you flounder?
Oh! I forgot my purse.
Do you have a pole?
I don't care what she's doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
Church isn't a party, Michael.
Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
I'm out too.
[on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It���s all garbage okay? You���re the woman, I���m the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
Call a doctor.
A restaurant.
Well, there is a ball.
No, there���s wine in here.
No, hey, Dwight shouldn���t...
We're in the same High School class.
That's what I said. He was spying in the ladies' room.
Robert's house is, well....I don't mean to sound offensive, but it's like where a basketball player would live.
Really?
[to Angela] So this is...
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
Oh, I have a flush!
Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
And napkins... fanned.
Michael, what will you do?
Dancing babies!
We don���t work for you!
I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk.
Yeah, I lost my client.
[notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
Oh.
I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
I say no.
Sure.
[Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow.
[sigh] What are you making?
[dancing with Stanley] I missed you.
I'm in too.
Ass.
I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
Put it down.
I���ll try this one.
I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
Oh, I don't think it's blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
You mean the clients you stole from us.
Write him up or I'll take it to Jan.
Uh, on or off?
Damn.
It's the only gavel I could find.
And it didn't change your mind.
Yeah...
It's cute. [plays with it]
Oh, I don't think you're being silly.
It's nice to learn new things.
Play it again.
It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
Afghani.
Michael, you should stay home and rest.
Role call.
[groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!
Yeah, good. Don't do it.
[laughing] Oh, you can afford it.
What's 'Scott's Tots?'
Mmm, no Bob, I don't know.
You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
[whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
Michael, that's awful.
You can pick one of these things.  It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
What do you mean?
No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
Maybe Florida.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
Yeah?
I could try to seduce him.
Oh, we find little times during the day.
When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
[whispering to Angela] I don't like you.
No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
Work.
I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
Luke? Luke!
A furnace?
Umm I don't know Michael.
Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
That can't be right.
What consequences?
Don���t you have any sunblock?
Mm.
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
Yes, very.
Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
How do you know it's a gun?
Hey!
You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
[sobbing] No.
Perfect. I hate registries.
I think you look nice.
What is it?
I'm really sorry. It was earlier today.
Hmm.
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
Hey, Andy!  Maybe this is one of those situations where you just have to do her to get her out of your system.
If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
What's going on?
[grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Congratulations!
The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
Dwight is our new boss.
Which one's Glee?
Hey, how's Annie?
Did you see...
I thought maybe DJ's.
He's a real catch and you should take him back.
Sic him!
Well--
Can I get a list of your vendors?
Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
[Phyllis, Pam, Toby, and Oscar are sharing iPod headphones] I don't understand.  Which one is that?
It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.
Where did you save the list of exchanges?
That seemed to shut her up.
You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
That's a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out]
Yeah. Poor Angela.
Just wear one of your bowties.
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus!
Afghani.
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
Oh, I'll just duck my head in.
[chuckling] Who takes a kid to Mexico?
[raises hand] Here.
You got dumped?
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
Hi.
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
Oh, are those your kids? They���re so cute! They could be models.
Dwight...
Hillary Swank.
Oh.
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.
That's true.
If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
Oh, I'll help you find it.
Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
Well, this could be fun. I-
Did you send him to the slammer?
[muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.
My perfume?
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ���gy-na��� for your entire meeting.
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
I like your frames.
Told you so.
One time I said good morning to her, and she didn't say it back.
Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
Are you good at homemade?
Wow. Sounds scary.
Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
Let me get you some water.
Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
I know, Kevin.
Okay.
Michael, Michael.
I love their breadsticks!
Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
[to Ernesto] I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
Really?
But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Isn't he sweet?
Uh...
I'll just go get a ginger ale.
Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
Jim, I am so f[bleep]ed.
I actually sleep better when it's raining.
Well, I guess that's not-
Holy crap.
No Bob, we worked it out.
There's always a theme.
I have an ace.
Okay.
Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
I am clicking.
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
Oh, you say that every time.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
I'm sorry, everybody.
Is that Cici?
Hi.
C���mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
Stanley, you're dancing!
Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
I did.
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
No we���re not.
Popcorn.
Move on, Michael.
Lose the twirl.
He means the ice pack.
An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
We did our best.
Go get 'em Dwight.
Good. Good.
Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
That's not a good idea, Michael.
How was jury duty?
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
It's really something.
Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
But the rattler's so scary.
They're important.
Yeah that was a surprise...
What's going on?
Ok... nice.
I'll see what I can find out.
Wait, they have food there?
How about pepperoni?
Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
No, it's 4:35.
Sorry. Plastered.
Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.
That's a shame.  Ed was a good guy.
Yeah.
We don't feel that way.
Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
I have a friend who's single.
Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
No way.
Cake.
I'm telling Michael.
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
Hey. I like.
Mistake.
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
No.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
That's right. Yeah.
Sexually?
Why?
He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.
During our honeymoon safari in Africa, Bob and I were driving late at night, and he'd been drinking, and suddenly thump.  We hit something with our jeep.  It was probably a man.  We didn't know what to do.  We heard the police were corrupt and they might beat us, so we just kept driving as fast as we could.  We bribed the airline, got on a plane that night, and fled home.  Maybe it was just an ostrich.  In a soccer uniform.
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
Are you sure? Yeah, it's locked.
Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
Welcome to your party.
Stanley! [hugs Stanley]
Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.
OK.
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
No.
Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?
You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
You don't even know what I'm talking about.
Oh, it's coming.
Sorry.
Is it true you're buying the company?
Yeah, it's just a picnic.
Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
Oh! Mother ******!
Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
What do you mean?
I'm good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]
What the hell?!
I'm the same age as you, Michael.
When?
Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
The only Santa.
They make you feel lighter...
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
Oh, Lord in heaven.
No. Call Bob.
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
I'll do it.
We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
[laughing] Thought we were playing for fun.
But we invited guests.
That's no pimple Michael.
[hugging Andy]. Andy���
Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
I don't know, I'm not used to the stress.
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Oh, Michael.
Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
Come on! This isn't fair!
You want to talk about it?
...report you to HR.
I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.
This says 'Bushiest Beaver'.
I think he left.
You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas]
I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
I guess so...
I don't think he'd do that.
I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
What else you got?
Hi guys.
Her hair looks beautiful.
[gasps] What does it say?
No, the one before that.
Bestiality. Yeah.
Andy's running over Dwight with his car.
Maybe I'll quit.
What don't you get?
This is stupid.
Again with the cousin.
It's, it's fine.
I was just getting a snack.
Good night, Andy.
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
Hmm?
Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
When I was growing up, my mom said, 'the sky's the limit.'  I could do anything.  Be a teacher's aide, nurse's assistant, some kind of volunteer.  But now, I, I'm not so sure.
I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
Why would you do that?
Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
That must have been hard.
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
Okay.
What���s it now, dream or no dream?
In the parking lot.
What did we write?
Those sound too harsh.
Yes.
It's times like these, I wish my mother were with me right now.  She'd show me what to do.  That's stupid; she's not here.  [looks at watch] She's at water aerobics for the next forty-five minutes.
Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
What smell?
Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
It's fish.
Helpless.
One more, one more! [cheers and applause]
I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
Haven't you been following the news? Ther university is using its non-profit status to fund its private real estate investments.
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
No, you knew me in high school.  Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
You know what? I don���t know where the years went. �����Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don���t even recognize them.
Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.
Mmm... sometimes her stockings have a run in them.
I'm gonna go call Bob.
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Made love? I don't know.
Yeah, I like Oscar.
Come on, Pam.
Yeah, it can���t be nothing.
But it's closer to you.
Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
[points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
Oh! [Michael laughs]
Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
I think it's a fun idea.
Hey, you two having fun?
