[to Pam] Come back...
Yeah, toast! Toast! Toast!
Whoa. What?
Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know?  They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
Yeah.
I can't.
Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.
No, I don't believe that.
No.
Yeah.
Okay. Cool.
You sit out there, don't you?
That was on Sesame Street.
You got that?
You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
Cool. What year were you there?
Thanks.
Is that from Starbucks?
We could do that ten years ago.
Why?
Wow. Is that for the office?
Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.
Cheers.
Congratulations.  You need a hot date more than anyone.
Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
Alright! You want to drive?
I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
Cool.
Cool, what year where you there?
Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.
Do you think that'll ever be us?
Bishop O'Hara.
I wouldn't think of it.
I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
Good.
Hi.
Oh, nothing.  My ride just bailed on me.
Um, for the... the desert island.
I'm not sure. It's faux snakeskin.
[looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute.
Oh, um, it's okay.
What?
[laughs]
Hi
What colors do you like?
I'm Katy.
Hi.
I don't think so I'm really busy.
I should probably get back to my table.
Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...
I really can't.
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
At five?
Oh.
It's very popular, yeah.
Pam, were you a cheerleader?
Thank you.
Ha. Yeah, asks a lot of questions.
Okay, um...
So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
It's a... it's a very nice car.
Okay.
You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?
Thank you.
[whispers] Sorry.
Hi!
No.
Katy.
Oh no, it's um...
Everybody, everybody? There is a toast. Come on...
Okay, um, first, Legally Blond.
Jim, come on, don't be shy.
Regular coffee is fine.
This one's really good for a hot date.
Okay. [laughs]
Both.
Alright.
I'm hungry.
Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
You should make a toast.
How are you?
You're really into reptiles, huh?
I'm gonna go back to my table.
No...
No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
No.
