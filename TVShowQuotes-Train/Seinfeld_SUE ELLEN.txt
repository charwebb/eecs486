Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents - and they're Indian.
Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?
Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend.
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift.
Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?
No, I really just needed to speak with him. (exhales)
(Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!
Uh, this is my fianc, Pinter. (To Pinter) Say hello.
Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.
Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on.
No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose!
Hmm. Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by.
I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.
