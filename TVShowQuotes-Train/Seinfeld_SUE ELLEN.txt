Thanks.
Elaine? Hi.
Uh, this is my fianc, Pinter. (To Pinter) Say hello.
Fourteen thousand.
Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.
Elaine?
(Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!
Twelve thousand.
Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift.
Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.
Shouldn't he elevate his legs?
Oh, that's too bad.
Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?
Hi Elaine.
Oh...
I've just been hanging out.
(Walking up to the group) Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!
Nooo?
Oh, I know. Thanks again.
Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on.
Hmm. Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by.
Oh, well maybe I will.
Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose!
Hi!
Is anything wrong?
I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
That's it! The wedding's off.
Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents - and they're Indian.
Ten thousand.
Um-hm.
I have never been so humiliated!
Nine thousand.
Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend.
I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
No, I really just needed to speak with him. (exhales)
