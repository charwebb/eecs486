Elaine?
If you don't mind.
Eight thousand.
I have never been so humiliated!
(Walking up to the group) Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!
Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?
Shouldn't he elevate his legs?
Um-hm.
Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.
Uh, this is my fianc, Pinter. (To Pinter) Say hello.
That's it! The wedding's off.
Oh, well maybe I will.
Fourteen thousand.
I've just been hanging out.
Elaine? Hi.
I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.
Ten thousand.
Oh...
Hi Elaine.
Nooo?
Twelve thousand.
No, I really just needed to speak with him. (exhales)
Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend.
Oh, that's too bad.
Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
Hi!
(Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!
Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.
No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose!
Nine thousand.
Is anything wrong?
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift.
I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?
Oh, I know. Thanks again.
