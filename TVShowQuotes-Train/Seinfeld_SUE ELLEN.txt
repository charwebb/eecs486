Oh, well maybe I will.
Twelve thousand.
Hi Elaine.
Hmm. Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by.
No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose!
Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend.
Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
Nooo?
Is anything wrong?
If you don't mind.
Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents - and they're Indian.
Shouldn't he elevate his legs?
Fourteen thousand.
Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?
Uh, this is my fianc, Pinter. (To Pinter) Say hello.
Ten thousand.
I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
Nine thousand.
Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?
Elaine?
(Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!
Oh, I know. Thanks again.
Oh...
Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on.
Um-hm.
That's it! The wedding's off.
(Walking up to the group) Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!
I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
Elaine? Hi.
Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.
No, I really just needed to speak with him. (exhales)
Hi!
Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.
Eight thousand.
Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.
I've just been hanging out.
