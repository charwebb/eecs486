No, I really just needed to speak with him. (exhales)
Hmm. Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by.
I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
(Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!
Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.
Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.
Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift.
Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend.
Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?
(Walking up to the group) Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!
Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?
Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents - and they're Indian.
Uh, this is my fianc, Pinter. (To Pinter) Say hello.
No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose!
