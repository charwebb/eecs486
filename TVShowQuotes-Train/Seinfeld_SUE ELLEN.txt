Hi!
Eight thousand.
Uhhh-Ah, it doesn't fit...I, I-I can't put it on.
Elaine? Hi.
Is anything wrong?
Um-hm.
Uh, this is my fianc, Pinter. (To Pinter) Say hello.
(Walking up to the group) Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!
Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.
Uh, no. It's Pinter. Does anyone want to use the bathroom?
Oh, well maybe I will.
Twelve thousand.
Oh, that's too bad.
I have never been so humiliated!
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop in, and thank you for your lovely gift.
That's it! The wedding's off.
I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
Hi Elaine.
Nooo?
Hmm. Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening, I'd love it if you came by.
Thanks.
Fourteen thousand.
Shouldn't he elevate his legs?
Well, of course! No one else was even willing to come to India. I mean, not even Pinter's parents - and they're Indian.
Oh, I know. Thanks again.
(Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!
Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?
I've just been hanging out.
Oh...
Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.
I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes.
No, I really just needed to speak with him. (exhales)
Elaine, I know. I know we've had our problems, but.. I want you to be my maid of honor - and my best friend.
Elaine?
Ten thousand.
Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the hall?
