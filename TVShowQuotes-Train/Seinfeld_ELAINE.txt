I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
I can't believe we broke up like that.
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
Well do you see it or don't you?
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
So? What do you want me to do about it?
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
All right, what time do you want me back here.
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
I can't believe what's going on out here.
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
And he's has a bit of a rash.
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
See what is that? Is that a date?
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
How can you possibly show your face there again?
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
When did you tell George to be here?
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
We're just, you know, having a good time.
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
If I was saying something I would have said it.
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
So what do you want me to do?
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
What-- What are you looking at me for?
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
There is no park and the team has relocated.
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
What for? Let's just get out of here.
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
Can you let go of my tongue now?
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
I never should have given Anna the impression--
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
Help us up so we can cross the street?
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
No, because I slept with my back to him.
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
Well, what do you want me to do?
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
You get yours out, I was here first!
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
It's the next best thing to being alone.
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
And you feel you're not really ready for,
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
I just said the same thing to you.
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
Things occur to me from time to time.
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
Why didn't you just call out his name?
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
Come on, what is taking you so long?
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
You going to do something about your sideburns?
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
I know, it's just something you have to say...
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
What are you doing? What is all this?
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
This food was in the shower with you?
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
I guess it was just a matter of time.
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
Jer, do you see where this is going?
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
Could you put it in a big bowl?
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
"I know that but why are you going?"
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
She's the one you went out with last night?
What? What do you need a rope for?
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
I'll put in a good word for you.
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
Id do it but I dont have any money.
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
You want the money for the big salad, George?
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
Did you tell him it was peed on?
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
You have a little thing for this fella'?
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
No! I won't be a party to this.
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
I don't think we should be talking about this.
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
I'll bet they were even in on it.
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
And I want my keys back from you!
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
You don't have the label maker, do you?
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
He told you all that? How could he?
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
No, but... it is very nice to know.
Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
What are you doing with your old couch?
Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
I need something to read on the subway.
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
No. We were both in the mood for one.
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
So you know , ... he called me.
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
I am never going back to the movies again
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
What? What is goin' on with you two?
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
Again you are telling me to shut up?
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
Then how are all these people getting together?
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
You can't ask a person to change their name.
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
why does she have to chew so many?
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
This was my idea you stole my idea.
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
Well I trust people not to do that.
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
Well what happened when you raced him again?
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
I told you, I can't hear a word.
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
Are you sure you want to do that?
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
What are you doing in here with that?
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
David and I will not be getting back together.
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
You oughta at least take a look at it.
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
Well we can take the car service from my office.
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
How do you even know the jacket is there?
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
I don't like this, it is to easy.
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
George I don't even want to get --
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
Well if you want it, you get it.
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
You're not still thinking about that are you?
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
I don't like to talk during a massage.
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
What? What are you trying to say, George?
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
This is it. I can take this anymore.
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
No, no, no. You give me your number.
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
ok step off George, can u just step off?
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
You can't let him get away with that!
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
You know we were here, ahead of you.
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
What is that noise? What is that noise?
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
All right! You know what, just forget it!
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
Really? You really think I should fire her?
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
I really think it's the size of your neck.
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
What about the party? What about the Drake?
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
Hey, we told you not to park there!
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
All right! I am back in the game.
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
What the hell is this? Where are you?
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
I still don't see what the big deal is.
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
We should be able to get across right through here!
I can't kick you out of your bed.
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
I dont know what your parents did to you.
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
All shell think is that you like her.
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
You just left? What did you tell her?
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
Why don't I give you my phone number?
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
You got me an apartment in the building?!
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
George, you got a little something, right here.
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
But you said it was in the store!.
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
I am not buying a computer from you.
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
He has to go. He may have killed her.
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
The one you broke the plans with tonight?
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
So tell me more about this game SIX.
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
his face, did something happen to his face?
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
