(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
Why didn't you just call out his name?
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
I just said the same thing to you.
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
Well if you want it, you get it.
Well do you see it or don't you?
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
So then why are you seeing her again...
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
I don't like this, it is to easy.
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
I know, it's just something you have to say...
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
his face, did something happen to his face?
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
So you know , ... he called me.
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
You want the money for the big salad, George?
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
I thought my idea was just as good.
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
I can't believe we broke up like that.
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
Well, what do you want me to do?
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
We should be able to get across right through here!
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
I'll put in a good word for you.
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
Then how are all these people getting together?
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
If I was saying something I would have said it.
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
Well what happened when you raced him again?
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
You got me an apartment in the building?!
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
I can't believe what's going on out here.
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
All right, what time do you want me back here.
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
Jer, do you see where this is going?
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
What are you doing? What is all this?
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
I can't kick you out of your bed.
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
Forget it. You are very careful with money.
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
Are you sure you want to do that?
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
There is no park and the team has relocated.
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
All right! I am back in the game.
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
You going to do something about your sideburns?
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
Things occur to me from time to time.
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
I dont know what your parents did to you.
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
What the hell is this? Where are you?
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
Did you tell him it was peed on?
And you feel you're not really ready for,
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
You don't have the label maker, do you?
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
What are you doing in here with that?
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
What did you have to say that for?
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
He has to go. He may have killed her.
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
What about the party? What about the Drake?
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
I'll bet they were even in on it.
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
Can you let go of my tongue now?
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
why does she have to chew so many?
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
No, but... it is very nice to know.
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
You can't let him get away with that!
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
But you said it was in the store!.
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
Could you put it in a big bowl?
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
We're just, you know, having a good time.
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
How can you possibly show your face there again?
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
Help us up so we can cross the street?
The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
When did you tell George to be here?
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
What? What, you dont want to go now?
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
Again you are telling me to shut up?
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
What for? Let's just get out of here.
You have a little thing for this fella'?
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
No, no, no. You give me your number.
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
I never should have given Anna the impression--
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
And he's has a bit of a rash.
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
I don't think we should be talking about this.
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
What? What do you need a rope for?
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
Well what do you want to give him, change?
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
All right and that just about... does it.
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
She's the one you went out with last night?
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
What is that noise? What is that noise?
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
No. We were both in the mood for one.
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
You just left? What did you tell her?
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
Really? You really think I should fire her?
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
"I know that but why are you going?"
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
You're not still thinking about that are you?
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
You oughta at least take a look at it.
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
This is it. I can take this anymore.
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
Why don't I give you my phone number?
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
George, you got a little something, right here.
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
This food was in the shower with you?
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
No, because I slept with my back to him.
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
How do you even know the jacket is there?
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
And then he starts writing on my chart.
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
[mind] What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy.
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
Are you sure you want us here for this?
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
David and I will not be getting back together.
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
I am not buying a computer from you.
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
It's the next best thing to being alone.
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
You get yours out, I was here first!
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
What? What are you trying to say, George?
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
ok step off George, can u just step off?
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
What? What is goin' on with you two?
So tell me more about this game SIX.
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
I still don't see what the big deal is.
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
All shell think is that you like her.
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
What-- What are you looking at me for?
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
You didn't say this to George, did you?
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
Id do it but I dont have any money.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
I am never going back to the movies again
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
And I want my keys back from you!
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
So what do you want me to do?
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
What did you think, that would impress me?
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
Well I trust people not to do that.
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
I really think it's the size of your neck.
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
I need something to read on the subway.
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
So? What do you want me to do about it?
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
Come on, what is taking you so long?
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
I told you, I can't hear a word.
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
I guess it was just a matter of time.
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
Hey, we told you not to park there!
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
Why? What happens if you don't order right?
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
You can't ask a person to change their name.
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
