Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
All right! You know what, just forget it!
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
And then he starts writing on my chart.
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
I'll put in a good word for you.
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
why does she have to chew so many?
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
You get yours out, I was here first!
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
Why? What happens if you don't order right?
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
See what is that? Is that a date?
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
I never should have given Anna the impression--
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
I am not buying a computer from you.
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
Why don't I give you my phone number?
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
I can't kick you out of your bed.
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
What? What is goin' on with you two?
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Well do you see it or don't you?
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
Well we can take the car service from my office.
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
We should be able to get across right through here!
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
I told you, I can't hear a word.
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
Hey, we told you not to park there!
Can you let go of my tongue now?
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
This is it. I can take this anymore.
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
I still don't see what the big deal is.
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
Well I trust people not to do that.
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
The one you broke the plans with tonight?
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
I don't think we should be talking about this.
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
You can't ask a person to change their name.
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
I'll bet they were even in on it.
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
I thought my idea was just as good.
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
So what do you want me to do?
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
I dont know what your parents did to you.
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
George I don't even want to get --
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
You didn't say this to George, did you?
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
I don't like to talk during a massage.
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
So tell me more about this game SIX.
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
What-- What are you looking at me for?
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
You going to do something about your sideburns?
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
Really? You really think I should fire her?
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
Well, what do you want me to do?
You oughta at least take a look at it.
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
How do you even know the jacket is there?
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
But you said it was in the store!.
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
Why didn't you just call out his name?
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
No, because I slept with my back to him.
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
George, you got a little something, right here.
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
You can't let him get away with that!
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
What for? Let's just get out of here.
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
Well what do you want to give him, change?
Could you put it in a big bowl?
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
All shell think is that you like her.
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
Jer, do you see where this is going?
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
I really think it's the size of your neck.
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
What are you doing with your old couch?
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
He told you all that? How could he?
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
What are you doing in here with that?
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
I don't like this, it is to easy.
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
Things occur to me from time to time.
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
So you know , ... he called me.
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
All right, what time do you want me back here.
You got me an apartment in the building?!
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
We're just, you know, having a good time.
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
Then how are all these people getting together?
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
I know, it's just something you have to say...
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
You want the money for the big salad, George?
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
Did you tell him it was peed on?
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
What? What do you need a rope for?
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
What is that noise? What is that noise?
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
What? What are you trying to say, George?
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
This was my idea you stole my idea.
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
So? What do you want me to do about it?
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
If I was saying something I would have said it.
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
No, no, no. You give me your number.
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
"I know that but why are you going?"
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
I can't believe what's going on out here.
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
There is no park and the team has relocated.
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
What about the party? What about the Drake?
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
I am never going back to the movies again
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
How can you possibly show your face there again?
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
You have a little thing for this fella'?
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
No, but... it is very nice to know.
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
his face, did something happen to his face?
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
When did you tell George to be here?
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
Forget it. You are very careful with money.
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
And he's has a bit of a rash.
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
What are you doing? What is all this?
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
Help us up so we can cross the street?
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
You just left? What did you tell her?
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
David and I will not be getting back together.
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
All right! I am back in the game.
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
ok step off George, can u just step off?
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
He has to go. He may have killed her.
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
Well what happened when you raced him again?
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
No. We were both in the mood for one.
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
It's the next best thing to being alone.
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
Again you are telling me to shut up?
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
So then why are you seeing her again...
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
You know we were here, ahead of you.
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
Well if you want it, you get it.
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
[mind] What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy.
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
Come on, what is taking you so long?
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
What? What, you dont want to go now?
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
Are you sure you want to do that?
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
What did you think, that would impress me?
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
Are you sure you want us here for this?
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
I just said the same thing to you.
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
