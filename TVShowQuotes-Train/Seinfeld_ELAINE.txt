(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
Again you are telling me to shut up?
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
I know, it's just something you have to say...
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
You have a little thing for this fella'?
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
I thought my idea was just as good.
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
I can't believe we broke up like that.
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
All shell think is that you like her.
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
Did you tell him it was peed on?
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
Forget it. You are very careful with money.
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
So what do you want me to do?
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
Can you let go of my tongue now?
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
I really think it's the size of your neck.
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
Well do you see it or don't you?
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
I can't kick you out of your bed.
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
And then he starts writing on my chart.
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
I still don't see what the big deal is.
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
You going to do something about your sideburns?
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
why does she have to chew so many?
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
George I don't even want to get --
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
What? What, you dont want to go now?
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
He told you all that? How could he?
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
No, because I slept with my back to him.
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
I'll put in a good word for you.
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
See what is that? Is that a date?
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
I just said the same thing to you.
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
So you know , ... he called me.
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
I can't believe what's going on out here.
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
We should be able to get across right through here!
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
All right! You know what, just forget it!
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
You're not still thinking about that are you?
Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
You don't have the label maker, do you?
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
What did you have to say that for?
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
What are you doing in here with that?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
All right! I am back in the game.
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
Could you put it in a big bowl?
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
Help us up so we can cross the street?
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
I am never going back to the movies again
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
If I was saying something I would have said it.
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
I dont know what your parents did to you.
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
What are you doing with your old couch?
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
"I know that but why are you going?"
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
I don't like to talk during a massage.
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
What for? Let's just get out of here.
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
What-- What are you looking at me for?
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
You got me an apartment in the building?!
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
Really? You really think I should fire her?
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
He has to go. He may have killed her.
What? What do you need a rope for?
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
All right, what time do you want me back here.
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
You get yours out, I was here first!
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
I guess it was just a matter of time.
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
Well we can take the car service from my office.
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
So? What do you want me to do about it?
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
And you feel you're not really ready for,
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
But you said it was in the store!.
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
No, but... it is very nice to know.
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
How do you even know the jacket is there?
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
And I want my keys back from you!
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
No! I won't be a party to this.
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
Why don't I give you my phone number?
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
Are you sure you want us here for this?
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
Come on, what is taking you so long?
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
And he's has a bit of a rash.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
When did you tell George to be here?
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
The one you broke the plans with tonight?
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
No, no, no. You give me your number.
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
You know we were here, ahead of you.
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
I don't think we should be talking about this.
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
This food was in the shower with you?
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
I am not buying a computer from you.
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
I don't like this, it is to easy.
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
No. We were both in the mood for one.
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
What? What is goin' on with you two?
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
Are you sure you want to do that?
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
It's the next best thing to being alone.
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
Why? What happens if you don't order right?
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
What are you doing? What is all this?
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
David and I will not be getting back together.
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
I told you, I can't hear a word.
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
You just left? What did you tell her?
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
This is it. I can take this anymore.
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
Things occur to me from time to time.
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
How can you possibly show your face there again?
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
What the hell is this? Where are you?
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
Well if you want it, you get it.
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
his face, did something happen to his face?
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
Well, what do you want me to do?
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
You didn't say this to George, did you?
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
She's the one you went out with last night?
Jer, do you see where this is going?
Well what happened when you raced him again?
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
Well I trust people not to do that.
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
So then why are you seeing her again...
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
[mind] What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy.
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
You can't let him get away with that!
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
I'll bet they were even in on it.
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
Why didn't you just call out his name?
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
What about the party? What about the Drake?
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
Id do it but I dont have any money.
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
You can't ask a person to change their name.
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
I need something to read on the subway.
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
You oughta at least take a look at it.
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
You want the money for the big salad, George?
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
What did you think, that would impress me?
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
Then how are all these people getting together?
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
What is that noise? What is that noise?
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
