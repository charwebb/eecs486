So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
Did you tell him it was peed on?
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
There is no park and the team has relocated.
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
So what do you want me to do?
All right! You know what, just forget it!
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
What are you doing with your old couch?
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
George I don't even want to get --
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
Why? What happens if you don't order right?
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
Are you sure you want to do that?
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
I can't believe what's going on out here.
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
You have a little thing for this fella'?
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
I don't like to talk during a massage.
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
So tell me more about this game SIX.
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
Can you let go of my tongue now?
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
You got me an apartment in the building?!
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
What the hell is this? Where are you?
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
You get yours out, I was here first!
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
I can't kick you out of your bed.
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
And you feel you're not really ready for,
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
David and I will not be getting back together.
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
I am not buying a computer from you.
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
Hey, we told you not to park there!
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
What did you think, that would impress me?
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
You want the money for the big salad, George?
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
This was my idea you stole my idea.
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
If I was saying something I would have said it.
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
his face, did something happen to his face?
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
You're not still thinking about that are you?
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
This is it. I can take this anymore.
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
So you know , ... he called me.
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
Why don't I give you my phone number?
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
I know, it's just something you have to say...
How can you possibly show your face there again?
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
You know we were here, ahead of you.
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
I don't think we should be talking about this.
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
What? What do you need a rope for?
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
You going to do something about your sideburns?
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
No, no, no. You give me your number.
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
The one you broke the plans with tonight?
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
I thought my idea was just as good.
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
And he's has a bit of a rash.
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
You don't have the label maker, do you?
[mind] What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy.
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
I guess it was just a matter of time.
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
All right and that just about... does it.
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
What? What, you dont want to go now?
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
I'll put in a good word for you.
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
He has to go. He may have killed her.
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
All shell think is that you like her.
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
Well if you want it, you get it.
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
What-- What are you looking at me for?
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
No. We were both in the mood for one.
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
What about the party? What about the Drake?
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
When did you tell George to be here?
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
why does she have to chew so many?
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
I'll bet they were even in on it.
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
You can't ask a person to change their name.
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
Jer, do you see where this is going?
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
"I know that but why are you going?"
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
I dont know what your parents did to you.
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
And I want my keys back from you!
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
Come on, what is taking you so long?
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
Well what happened when you raced him again?
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
All right, what time do you want me back here.
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
I need something to read on the subway.
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
Well what do you want to give him, change?
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
No, because I slept with my back to him.
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.
You didn't say this to George, did you?
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
Forget it. You are very careful with money.
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
I told you, I can't hear a word.
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
What are you doing? What is all this?
What did you have to say that for?
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
See what is that? Is that a date?
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
I never should have given Anna the impression--
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
I don't like this, it is to easy.
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
What for? Let's just get out of here.
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
You just left? What did you tell her?
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
All right! I am back in the game.
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
Are you sure you want us here for this?
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
What are you doing in here with that?
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
I still don't see what the big deal is.
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
Well we can take the car service from my office.
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
So? What do you want me to do about it?
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
ok step off George, can u just step off?
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
No! I won't be a party to this.
Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
We're just, you know, having a good time.
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
What? What is goin' on with you two?
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
George, you got a little something, right here.
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
So then why are you seeing her again...
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
It's the next best thing to being alone.
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
Why didn't you just call out his name?
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
You can't let him get away with that!
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
You oughta at least take a look at it.
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
Again you are telling me to shut up?
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
And then he starts writing on my chart.
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
This food was in the shower with you?
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
I just said the same thing to you.
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Could you put it in a big bowl?
She's the one you went out with last night?
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
I am never going back to the movies again
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
Help us up so we can cross the street?
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
But you said it was in the store!.
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
What? What are you trying to say, George?
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
Well I trust people not to do that.
Then how are all these people getting together?
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
No, but... it is very nice to know.
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
Id do it but I dont have any money.
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
