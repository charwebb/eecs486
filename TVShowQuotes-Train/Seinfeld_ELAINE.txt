(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
You going to do something about your sideburns?
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
No, because I slept with my back to him.
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
So you know , ... he called me.
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
You can't let him get away with that!
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
Well we can take the car service from my office.
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
George, you got a little something, right here.
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
I can't kick you out of your bed.
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
Why don't I give you my phone number?
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
We should be able to get across right through here!
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
Well what happened when you raced him again?
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
Help us up so we can cross the street?
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
How do you even know the jacket is there?
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
All right and that just about... does it.
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
All right, what time do you want me back here.
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
She's the one you went out with last night?
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
George I don't even want to get --
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
The one you broke the plans with tonight?
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
Forget it. You are very careful with money.
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
his face, did something happen to his face?
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
I'll put in a good word for you.
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
Could you put it in a big bowl?
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
But you said it was in the store!.
And then he starts writing on my chart.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
What is that noise? What is that noise?
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
You can't ask a person to change their name.
What are you doing? What is all this?
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
What the hell is this? Where are you?
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
Well, what do you want me to do?
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
[mind] What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy.
I never should have given Anna the impression--
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
I am never going back to the movies again
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
What about the party? What about the Drake?
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
No! I won't be a party to this.
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
Why? What happens if you don't order right?
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
Did you tell him it was peed on?
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
What did you have to say that for?
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
Then how are all these people getting together?
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
No, but... it is very nice to know.
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
You didn't say this to George, did you?
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
I really think it's the size of your neck.
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
You want the money for the big salad, George?
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
You get yours out, I was here first!
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
Well I trust people not to do that.
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
What? What, you dont want to go now?
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
What are you doing in here with that?
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
What-- What are you looking at me for?
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
What for? Let's just get out of here.
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
ok step off George, can u just step off?
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
What? What are you trying to say, George?
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
We're just, you know, having a good time.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
How can you possibly show your face there again?
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
I dont know what your parents did to you.
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
Are you sure you want to do that?
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
I can't believe what's going on out here.
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
"I know that but why are you going?"
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
Jer, do you see where this is going?
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
Id do it but I dont have any money.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
Really? You really think I should fire her?
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
I still don't see what the big deal is.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
You don't have the label maker, do you?
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
So? What do you want me to do about it?
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
You have a little thing for this fella'?
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
This is it. I can take this anymore.
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
Well if you want it, you get it.
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
You just left? What did you tell her?
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
Can you let go of my tongue now?
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
See what is that? Is that a date?
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
You're not still thinking about that are you?
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
Are you sure you want us here for this?
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
There is no park and the team has relocated.
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
I'll bet they were even in on it.
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
why does she have to chew so many?
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
I guess it was just a matter of time.
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
This food was in the shower with you?
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
I don't like this, it is to easy.
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
David and I will not be getting back together.
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
And you feel you're not really ready for,
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
So tell me more about this game SIX.
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
Things occur to me from time to time.
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
What? What is goin' on with you two?
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
Again you are telling me to shut up?
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
You know we were here, ahead of you.
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
All shell think is that you like her.
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
If I was saying something I would have said it.
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
You got me an apartment in the building?!
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
Well what do you want to give him, change?
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
Why didn't you just call out his name?
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
What? What do you need a rope for?
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
You oughta at least take a look at it.
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
Come on, what is taking you so long?
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
Hey, we told you not to park there!
He told you all that? How could he?
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
When did you tell George to be here?
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
He has to go. He may have killed her.
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
Well do you see it or don't you?
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
So what do you want me to do?
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
What did you think, that would impress me?
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
I need something to read on the subway.
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
I am not buying a computer from you.
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
All right! You know what, just forget it!
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
And I want my keys back from you!
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
I know, it's just something you have to say...
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
It's the next best thing to being alone.
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
All right! I am back in the game.
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
So then why are you seeing her again...
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
No, no, no. You give me your number.
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
I don't think we should be talking about this.
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
