Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
Potato.
Make it three hundred.
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
And then you flush.
No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
(scoffs) Uh, is Noreen there?
What?
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
No, still Sharon!
Pick. Up.
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
Well, it's for my boss.
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
What about the kiss goodnight?
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
Yeeeahh!!!
Oy vey!
Well, what do you want me to do?
What?
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
Well, maybe.
I don't know about that.
Why?
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
Theyre very clean animals.
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
"War-- What is it good for?"!
Dogs. Oh I love dogs.
(shouting up) Jerry! Jerry!
Who's faking?
Night.
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
Hey, how's your hair?
Goodbye.
Sigh/Ugh.
Oh, well, (pauses) Good night.
Yeah...
Oh, hi.
What are you doing here?
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Oh, it was a frame-up.
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
Not good. I'm a moron.
Well, did he say that?
(Accepting) Alright.
Uh, kind of.
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
Dump her.
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
(uncomfortable) Ooh.
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
(stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back.
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
Hello.... hello, oh...
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
(resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine.
I'm so sorry George
Uh, no, I'm OK.
Hi Jerry!
(setting down her glass) Oh, ya haha.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you pick it up?
Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
Well, she wants you to like her.
Okay, c'mon it's movie time.
Yeah, but you like the face painting.
Hey!
Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.
Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine.
Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this.
Alright, well, now that's something..
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
Oh, he's...he's a joy...
What does he do?
Hmm. I never take them.
Uh, it was in the Hamptons.
What are you doing here?
This is Aaron.
Yes! Grace!
Kitzmiller.
I'm not being superficial
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
(looking in her purse) Oh, here.
Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.
I think he emphasized "would."
I don't blame ya'
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
Id better not.
Well, um, he, he got fired.
Right!!
No.
What? Well, who's gonna do it?
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
What happened? It looks the same.
Fine! Were through!
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
How do you know?
Who else is on the show?
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
Uh huh.
Hello father.
(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
Get in there!
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
(spoken to Testikov) that's a song
When did you tell George to be here?
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
Yeah, yeah, hello.
Just me and George alone?
(shrugging it off) Oh.
No, I'm sure you do.
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
Yeah.
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
Is that something?
Oh, god.
The remote goes through the bubble?
Burma.
Yeah.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
So, that's the situation.
Uh
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
What?
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
What is that?
Jer, do you see where this is going?
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
huh, Mine's 145.
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
Hey.
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
What?!
(same time as Jerry) --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.
My pleasure.
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
Hey guys...
No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
What?
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
Good day.
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
Kramer, you're hurting me!
George's Susan?
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
Un-huh.
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
I'm not saying anything.
Both of the them.
You don't like them?
It's dancing.
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
Hey!
Good for you.
You did enough.
Forty-seven.
Dinner's good.
Because! Because she missed her period!
Well, have they called the police yet?
George!
So what?
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
Karate?
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
Where are they?
What's going on?
No, No...
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
Is that something?
Wow. Youre right. That is loud.
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
Right
Hey, what are you doing?
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
Oh, what is this?
Oh, gorgeous, yes.
Statute.
Wall street.
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
Of what?
(quietly) OK.
You're wrong.
Hello.
Bye.
What happened?
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
No. Why would you think that?
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
What is that?
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.
Uh, Mr. Pitt...
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
(intercom) it?s me!
(sniffing) Dandruff?
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
Why do I keep setting you up?
You don't have any furniture?
We're not going to sit together?
Oh, great. Send him in.
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
Oh, I love cashmere.
Its OK. (starts walking down the hallway)
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
(whispering to Jerry) Yes!
What are you doing? What is all this?
So. What is she?
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
A fur?
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
Youre getting what?
How could you not take the directions?
Kneel?
Yeah.
Find out what's going on!
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
Yeah, I am.
George I wasnt serious.
Yeah. See that--
. . . no.
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
(embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters.
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
We just didn't think of you.
(giggling) Ohhh!!.
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
(raises her hand) Yo.
What's he look like?
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
"You can't find beauty in a man?"
Oh my god.
But why? Why can't you do it?
Um, no.
After one date!
(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
Oh, me too.
Puddy, don't wait for me.
Yeah.
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
Okay.
Who's Kristin?
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
Well, that'll get you goin' right there...
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
I gave him an ultimatum.
(laughing) No thanks.
Well...
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
Raquel Welch!
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
What are you, yellow?
Did you read the whole thing?
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
No, I'm not. Here you go.
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
We're going out tomorrow night.
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
Yeah.
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
What?
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
Mmm.
Yeah, Yeah!!
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
He'll only play with his racquet
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
Yeah, I could use a chuckle.
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
I don't know, maybe.
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
uh-uh.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
Really?
Thanks for the dinner.
You can't beat a babka.
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
But why? Why don't you want to?
Yeah.
Ninety-nine percent sure?!
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
Well, uh, I'll cancel it.
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
According to Puddy.
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
Yeah, it's all taken care of.
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
So? Where were you?!
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
YOU feel?
I'll go to Paris.
Oh, Great.
So.
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!
Some dinner, huh?
I tought you didn't like double dates.
OK.
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
Well! Well, it could be you.
Hey!
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
That's stealing?
No way!
What? What is this?
I like Julie. She's very personable.
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
So you know , ... he called me.
Yeah.
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
George, you got a little something, right here.
(dumbfounded) No.
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
You're all grown up.
Maybe.
(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.
Prognosis... negative.
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
Why not?
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
Hi Sue Ellen.
What, Uh oh?
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
Huh huh.
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
How ya feeling?
(Let down) He didn't show.
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
No, I'm watching my weight.
I dont know.
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
Yes! 212.
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
Really, like when?
Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!
Mr. Peterman.
I told ya.
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
Hello.
No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
(not convinced) Ech.
Yes.
(encouraging) Dont forget.
What is this symbol?
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
Yeah.
Chilly out.
Yeah, he did.
ok step off George, can u just step off?
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
What?
7.0
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
Well, I --
Cause then I could move in here.
What black guy?
No thanks!
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Oh, hi Fred.
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
Why? Why were you so embarrassed?
Yep! just you and Kramer.
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
( knocks) Hello is anybody here?..
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
(on buzzer) It's me.
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
[To Jerry] What about you?
[exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.
I, uh, wait,
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
Yeah, the address is 78th West...
Me?
Guess what I ate.
Noo, thanks.
I thought you were busy tonight.
What?
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
I think it's B.O.!
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
Good working with you.
Oh, we forgot to pick a number.
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
Get out!
Why do you keep watching?
Shut up, George.
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?
No, wait!
Okay...Good day..
Who did that? Who did that?!?
(pause) What do you mean?
Yeah.
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
What?
Me?
(picking up) Jerry!
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
He's a human maraca.
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.
Hey, Puddy.
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
Ha hum...Do you like George?
What are you doing?
(weary) Okay.
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
Oh, you want one?
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
Yes it is.
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
Yeah. You're right.
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
Jerry, you can barbecue back here.
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
I'm okay, it's just a nip.
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
I just thought I could write it.
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
Ah hah.
I don't know.
Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
O.K., fine, I have...no grace.
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
So? How was it?
My, my father?
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
No, I really don't want to.
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
(pleased) Ah.
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
"Yeah! Mel Torm, That's his nickname."
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
She's Cynthia!
Hey George.
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
Yeah.
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
Really?
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
Hi, Gail.
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
I'm in looove!
Hey.
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
.....Hi.
How do you know all that?
Oh, could you please hurry?
Are you
You're talking too much!
Nelson.
Oh great, thanks Kramer.
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
Quiet! So where is this Sophie?
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
South Africa.
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
I'll take it.
I don't have a boyfriend.
What?
Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!
Exactly.
Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
Hello?
You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?
I didn't get it.
Ya, Yes we will!
Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
I don't have a fax machine.
(not sure) I guess.
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
You sure?
Yeah, so?
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
Well eh, kind of....
You're eating my food!
(sits beside Jerry) What?
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
I've never seen you jealous before.
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
(Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.
Like you're a liar!
Ye.
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
What?
Did you tell him it was peed on?
Ah--this is part of the problem!
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
What soup place?
Hello?
Vivian...
Judy, hi, listen...
Yeah.
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
No, nothing.
I don't know. What do you think?
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
(exhales) They're going to be heroes.
He schnapped me.
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
What is that?
You can tip a gardener.
What happened last night?
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.
I need something to read on the subway.
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
Yeah, there is, right here you see--
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.
Hiiii Kramer
(dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him.
(horrified) Get together!!
It smells like a rubber fire.
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
Yeah!
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
Hi!
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
Did you tell Kramer?
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
What, what is it?
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
Oh, see, this is the problem.
Really?
What?, uh?
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
Oh, OK, see you later.
Its Elaine.
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
[exasperated] What is it made of?
What?
A lot!
Well, I don't know about "gold."
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
(engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm.
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
What?
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
Ooooh, please.
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
You know, uh...they're fake.
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
I can't do it.
Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
What pool guy?
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder.
How did you get that job?
What happened?
I said I'll take care of it!
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
yes, (sob) I suppose,
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
Oh.
What would you wear?
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
(unsure) Oh-kay.
(flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice.
Yeah..heheah (laughing a bit)
Who is it?
When do you take this exam?
But I got my own note.
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
What do you mean, like laundry?
What guy?
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
Nah, we just play defense.
What is wrong with Ned?
No no no, they weren't here before.
Hmmm?
Is anything wrong?
You wanna go out with him?
Mmm
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
Hey.
Jerry, are you free on Friday?
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
Well, you know what? (removes glasses)
Give it give it ..
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
Yes. He's one of those bounders.
What?
(triumphant) Ha, ha, ha ha!
Who is he?
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
Hi, Michael!
Then how come we're not moving?
What, the one who just left?
Hi, Mr. Lippman.
No.
Great, great.
Yup.
So did you hear this message?
The dingo ate your baby!
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
Yes! Couldn't you see that?
Hey, what time is it?
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
"What are you..crazy?"
Oh! my God.
Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...
I know! Can you imagine that?
Since when is a drain a toilet?!
So how did this happen?
Pardon me?
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
We have to break up.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
Hi!
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
We're not wilding.
Having a good time!
Kramer, what are you doing here?
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
I can't believe this!
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
Ill eat out.
Oh, GREAT!
What?
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
Do you smell something?
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Hey.
Is that with the parts and labor?
Huh. All right. Come on.
Ah, Susan uses the sponge.
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
Shut up and pack!
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
uh.
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
I don't know.
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
No.
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
It's Vegetable Lasagna.
Uhm...
Elaine.
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
Karen?
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
Oh, my God.
But you were!!
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
Ahh ... wait till you hear this.
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
Hey! Wait up!
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
Well, you're not Superman.
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
Ah, I didn't know who he was!
You're not still thinking about that are you?
Oh! my God.
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
Okay, (to Jerry) Move along. . .
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
Jerry!
Nah it's nothing.
So how's it going with my friend?
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
I'm sorry but there's somebody else.
I never saw anyone play like that.
What is it?
Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters.
Hi, I'm Elaine.
He took it out.
What? You never told me that.
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
"Penthouse?"
Me?
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
Yeah Jerry.
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
Is there a table ready?
Mm-hmm.
(Concerned) What's the matter?
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
Well...
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
Okay.
No, no, he's not my boyfriend.
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
George.
Oh, you'll be playing ...
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
So what happened?
Forget it. You are very careful with money.
(quiet) Look at this turnout.
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
Here.
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
The K Man did it!
Oh, that's not too expensive.
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
It's not a purse. It's European.
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
There's no time.
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
(CONT'D) Where have you been?
Uhh. No George!
Yeah, you want five?
I am?
He didn't mention . . .
Uh... sure/yeah..
(head in arms) I know--
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
Jerry!
She's not bitter!
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.
Wait up!
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
Heres your plane ticket.
I'll see you later.
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
Oh.
You got that right.
It's Elaine.
All right, I'm gonna go.
Wow, this is soft suede.
Pffft....there's really nothing to do.
What neck hole?
You missed quite a performance.
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
Yeah.
Hi.
Yes, that's correct.
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
Help him move? Move what?
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
Oh, I know the type.
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
Heyyyyyy (leaning in, very friendly and happy)
Nope.
She...likes you..
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
Excuse me?
Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
No, really.
(making a face) "Moland"?
Huh.
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
What?
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
George?
How'd you manage that.
What are you doing?
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
I'm not telling you.
Oh yeah? Can I see it?
Yeah, they flip a coin.
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
My Puddy? But we broke up.
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
It was an accident.
No.
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
Shut up!
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
Tim.
My god, George!
JERRY Cosmo
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
Uh huh.
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
Eatin' olives.
(pushes him) You doofus!
That's it?
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
Well, that is, that is strange.
(delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman.
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
He's on with a Chinese woman.
Ohh!
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
No, get-get off my purse!
Who was Pippi Longstocking?
Ill hang this phone up right now!
He's not my boyfriend.
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
Of Vincent's picks?
Shall I undo it?
... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)
Oh.
Yeah, you *could*...
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
Oh...I don't think so.
Yup. You?
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
Hi
Oh, you have to lie.
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
I am? But that's so sick.
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
What?
Oh, god! Let us out!
Its great to... talk about... other people...
"Hey Jimmy!!"
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
Make it clear?
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
What is it?
Oh, Hi.
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
If I was saying something I would have said it.
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
(sighs) So 10 to 14 months.
What? No Jerry, you have to go.
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
But you didn't say anything. Ohhh
Oh, no! I thought--
I got a note from my gynecologist.
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
He did.
No, but there was nobody sitting here...
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
I've got to go
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
I will never understand people.
[heavy sarcasm] Oh. Thanks.
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
(positive) Oh! (little chuckle)
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
Just imports? No exports?
Oh, tons!
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
Then why did you print it.
Tomato Sauce?
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
Hey.
What?
I can find out.
Then how did you find the place?
I was with David *Putty* last night.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
Katra?
Oh man, hes nuts.
Bye.
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
But I really did like it
Yeah, that's too bad.
But it's got a pee-stain on it.
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
Well, how are we gonna do it?
Oh is that so.
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
Great. You?
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
Oh, sure.
Oh, thank you.
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
Well, that was fast!
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
Yeah, me too.
That's a pretty girl.
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
Well maybe you should ask him!
Uhh... no.
You told them that?
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
What?
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
What do I have to know?
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
Why?
What for? Let's just get out of here.
That's the emergency?
Oh, hi Noel
No, I mentioned the bisk.
Well, either way
Seven?
Certainly not.
(Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.
What were your.. demands?
Well, I'm so sorry! I-
What else?
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
You are kidding.
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
Fish don't feel any pain.
Nah! They're fake!
(unhappy) I...
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
Oh my God.
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
Who? Who is Ramon?
all right then, where is it??
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
Hem!! No reason.
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
We never dated in winter.
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
I can't believe what's going on out here.
You ready?
(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.
Yeah, but...*I* like the move.
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
Have you thought about an intervention?
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'
Oh, bye. Good to see you.
(sees racquet) Could I ...
The pick?
Not, my Tim Whatley?
Yeah.
Well, they're not kept in little cages.
laughing awkwardly Oh. Right. Good one.
Because we're adults?
Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
(pointing at the shoes) "What are those?"
What's going on?
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
Do, do you?
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
No.
I touched 'em.
Dad thinks George is gay.
(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans.
Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
Oh!
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
What meeting?
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
I'm not in the mood.
Jerry, He's A GUY!
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
You got a comfort problem there?
[momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small?
How did you know you cut it?
(Shocked) Stabbed?!
Hi, Toby.
Let go of my tongue!
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
Rarely.
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
We talked about that already.
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
Five minutes.
Really!?
What statue?
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
What is that noise? What is that noise?
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
Heh?
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
O.K. Thanks.
What is the big deal!!
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
She sent you a Christmas card?
No, that'd be too noisy.
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?
(resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman.
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
You've never felt remorse.
What?
Wha'd you get on your SAT's?
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
(Getting up to leave) Alright.
(smiling and flirty) Hi.
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
New jeans?
Try it on.
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
Uhh
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
It's us.
This is an absolute disaster.
"Yeah. What happened was...."
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
He asked me out for Saturday night.
Andre?
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
Babu Bhatt did it.
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
What're you stopping here for?
I'm not below.
Alright, gimme the phone... it's my "thing"...
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
Oh. (Leaves for the room)
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
This guy I'm seeing.
(shouts) HEY!!
Well some people drink coffee that late.
It works.
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
. . . shut up! (?)
"Why?"
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
This is nice.
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
Ah.
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
Jerry.
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
I'm sorry you have to go.
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
Ugh!
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
It's a new area code.
Why?
Did you see that?
I can't kick you out of your bed.
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
Jerry, we don't have time for this...
They took Babu away?!
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
Why don't you just go see Jerry?
Correct.
Aah!
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
What IQ test?
(Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?
Ah.
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
You're telling me.
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
Oh. My ballet tickets.
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
Hmm. (she nods in agreement)
What?
I thought you were finished.
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
Why did you get a maid?
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
You don't have an old pair?
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
Could you put it in a big bowl?
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
Maybe coffee was coffee.
Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
Yeah.
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
Why?
Yeah.
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
Maybe.
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
I know.
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
Uh ha.
A little stale.
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
Uh, Mr. Costanza, I
Not getting along?
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
Hey.
Hey.
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
I've touched mine!
Oh. Oh God.
Hello.
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.
Is he happy?
Hey George
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
Yes indeed.
What? What do you need a rope for?
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
(firm) No you didn't.
(extemporising) Uh... chips.
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
What about a bad gasket?
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
You're lucky I don't report you...
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
Hi!
Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!
THIS is what you came up with?
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
Those school zones are a killer.
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
Black Forrest?
(Mock sympathy) Well.. David, it happens.
Yes, it's a must lie situation.
You didn't know.
Ohh.. my..
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
Malaysia?
So what?
Who's this guy?
Oh, he went insane?...
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
But he's so small.
yeah, yeah
You smoke?
You wanna know what I said?
What the--
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
I've lost 6 pounds.
Actually I thought he was very professional.
Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
Can we do this later, George?
"Oh yeah! Jimmy."
No, that's not it!
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
You're way off.
Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?
Fine, fine, fine.
She gave it to charity.
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
Oh, hi, Frank.
Why not.
Sure - the video.
(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
What?
Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
Hello boys.
Why is that?
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
Yeah.
(Flattered) Mr. Pitt...
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
Jerry?
Plan B? There is no plan B.
I don't buy it.
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
Oh it's you.
Uh huh.
They don't know anybody in Chicago.
Yeah. Upstairs?
You do?
I will.
Yeah, how about her?
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.
What is this?
Oh, yeah. I see him.
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
Yeah.
Well, nobody *told* me that!
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
My back hurts.
Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
No, you look pale.
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
Mr. Pitt...
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
(Into the intercom) Yeah?
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
Yeah, yeah, that too.
What?
Why didn't you just call out his name?
Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?
Look at that woman.
You been enjoying them?
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
Really?
So, its the same thing.
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
Really? Can you really take a picture?
Yeah.
Really....but I barely know you.
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
Help us up so we can cross the street?
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
How many?
Yeah, perhaps.
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
A little.
Softer.
Well how about a carrot cake?
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
I *love* the Drake.
No, I talked him into it.
So... impudent.
This was my idea you stole my idea.
Right.
I guess we could've called for help.
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
 Hi! How are you?
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
Would you please?!
Oh, of course.
Yeah, we're good friends.
It's brug-wa (?).
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
Hi.
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
He's got a back problem.
How was it?
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
"What you do!!. You don't do anything."
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
It could be very confusing.
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
Oh, no, I-I don't think so.
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
Mm! To get what?
What do you charge for blown shocks?
I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...
Well, actually it's pretty grimy.
I still smell!
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
I didn't hear anything.
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
No.
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
(to Kramer) He took it out.
"Able Mentally Challenged Adults"
I am up for anything.
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
Oh, hi! (Waves at him)
Well, a lot of it is vegetable...
Did you get a haircut?
(sarcastically, to George) Stay!
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
What?
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
They're going to promote me to editor.
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
Of course there's a community.
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
Yeah, I'm on the phone here.
What?
Oh really?
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.
Why?
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
Congratulations.
Have you seen the card?
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
We try.
At work?
You have no choice.
(stretching) Oh Man... Uunh.
(tossing the ball back) Yeah.
You're buying a speedboat?
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
They're from Malaysia.
. Well this is all very flattering...
Ah hahaha hhuu ha (flirty laughing)
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
Hi.
It's possible.
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
Hi, I'm Elaine.
Alright.
How can you even consider not going?
No there has got be a mistake.
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
It's me.
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
Still a 31 waist?
Mrs. Winston?
(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
Yeah.
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
I know, but he does.
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
No!
O, your being auditted? What for?
Ill see ya. (Hanging up the phone)
I thought you hated Los Angeles.
Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry.
Why are they doing this?
(looking for support) Jerry!
Things occur to me from time to time.
You going to do something about your sideburns?
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
Kramer?
In them?!
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
So what'd you do?
Hi, Jer.
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
So?
No! Jerry! Jerry!
Yeah, right.
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
Uh uh
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
Oh, my god.
"Yeah!"
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
I hate the counter.
You can still go.
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
Since when do you wear cologne?
Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh!
How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
(surprise) Hey, what're you guys doing here?
You can't tell me?
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
Then maybe you have a fax machine.
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
So now Duncan is back?
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
Didnt work, huh?
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
Casus belli.
What?
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
They all are.
What did you do?
OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??
Can I get you anything?
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
But I really enjoy dancing.
He actually went to the hospital?
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
(concerned) What? Lloyd is here?
Hi (?). Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!
So what?
Hey, working out?
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
Yeah
did you have fun
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
You think?
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
You mean like like?
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
Oh, did you check you machine?
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
Mm-Hmm.
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
But I wanted to see the bushmen.
I know that look.
I never told you his name.
(indicating) You remember Katy?
I don't think so.
See you later.
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
Kramer!
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
C'mon.
With the car!
Why not?
Artie Shaw. "Honeysuckle Jump." (The song ends.)
What's with the claw?
I guess I'm... Lois Loan.
What, you never said it?
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
Yeah.
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
yeah ha ha ha
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
So? What do you want me to do about it?
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
Look at you. You're on a slant.
Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
You never know...
Hi Tina.
A pleasure.
You know...*the* move.
w-What is this all about?
Hello?
Well it did occur to me.
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
Oh, gimme a break!
What is it?
I don't know - it just is.
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
What's up?
He's in.
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
Yeah. What do you do all day?
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
I think it's unconscionable.
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
Oh it was such a great night.
George?
I'm not Jewish.
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
He could have died
Yeah.
(Shrugging it off) eh.
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)
Yeah, nice to see you, too.
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
Yeah. Who sent you that one?
The pygmy pullover.
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
Jesus?
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
What's happening?
He'd just be touching your back.
(off camera) Huh.
I love Cajun cooking.
Yeah, Art Vandelay.
Vanessa.
Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?
Oh!!!
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.
Ah, you don't have to tell me.
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
It felt like a couple of levels.
Huh?
Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
Oh.
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
Kramer
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
Whoa. What is the matter?
(Correcting herself) Maestro!
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Hi/Hey.
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
here, take it
What?
Oh, that sounds... romantic.
He told you about . . .
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
Alright, Im out of here.
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
Thirty-seven.
Ow, ow move over.
(puzzled) You? What're you doing here?
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
Ok, so now what?
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
Oh, you know what? He got engaged.
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
Did you ever hear of...holding it in?
(Shrugging) I thought all guys do that.
There's Rachel.
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
And what times the funeral?
So who's playing Elaine?
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
Hey.
Why?
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
"What are you gettin'?"
You want to go to India?
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
She died!
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
 Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!
(Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.
Mr. Peterman, um--
(quietly) Give that to me.
I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm)
What is your answer to number 74?
Ah,
Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?
Hi,
Ugh! You are kidding me.
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
Alright, send him up here.
She was lost...
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
What do you mean bald?
86th and Broadway please.
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
(looks up, screaming in frustration!) Suuuuuuuuuuze!
(interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry!
Where is someone? I'm starving.
I told you, I can't hear a word.
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
Ah, I'm ready what?
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
Uh-huh.
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
Your old high school hangout? Why?
This is what people do.
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.
Hey! Guess who's not married.
Alright. Goodnight.
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
Okay.
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
It's garbage.
Ed.
What was that?
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
I smell cherry.
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
What exactly was that kid?
Who are they?
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
No, no! They'll stay up!
I've never seen her before.
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
Oh! (tries to take paper)
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
Good for you.
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.
Yeah, Kramer, come on in.
I don't think we should be talking about this.
No it's not.
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
On some people.
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
What kind of maniac is this guy?
Hey, what if he's married?
What?
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
You what?
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.
Yes, she's a dermatologist.
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
Mr Lippman?
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
Well, she has it!
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
What do you do?
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
hell-oo
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
Kramer, they're painted on!
Hi.
So he was bad. What d'you care?
No, there are degrees of coincidences.
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
Winona is a Native American.
What did he do?
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
No!
Mind? Oh o-of course not.
Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
Relax--
Tia? Who's that?
Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?
Haven't you done enough to these people?
Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
(Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm.
I like your little bag.
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
I thought he was with you.
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
Sure.
Uh, man!
(as though receiving a revelation) Poppies!
What?
I've always loved ... United Airlines.
Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt.
eh, Remember Roy, the artist?
He can't go left.
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
Of course I hear that.
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
What house guest?
Hi! How 'r u doing?
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
Hm-hmm.
Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
Uh huh.
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
I, I don't think so.
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
No.
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
You were?
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
No! I won't!
You know Jerry I really like this guy who's playing the butler.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
Devastating.
I don't believe this woman.
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
I...touched...'em.
Where are you going?
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
(quietly) Ahhhhh
That's ridiculous.
Ooohh.
Yeah, but we have a common goal.
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
No, thats too much money to borrow.
Ha, I didn't mention it.
Well, I'll see ya... (exits)
Mm hmm.
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
And you get along well with women.
Wow!
Do you have an apple or anything?
(backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww...
Kramer?
Na.
Oh, Jeffrey.
What are you doing here?
And I am not coming back!
What's wrong with your shower?
What's going on?
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
Ow! Careful, it's hot.
I knew it! You're a regifter!
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
hey you got a problem with Tony?
Did you try the cigarettes?
You know, we should say something.
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
Sorry. Somebody...help us!
All right. He kissed me. Okay?
Absurd!
(dismayed) Ah, all o'--all of us?
I just met him this morning.
"Ughhhh"
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
I got what you asked.
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
I need some space.
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
Kramer?
You see? Again.
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
his face, did something happen to his face?
Why not?
(pause) Well... Can I talk to her?
It's a beautiful couch.
Oh, so---so that's it?
Come on tell me what happened.
(exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?
You went...in the shower?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
What does that mean?
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
You never know.
Yeah.
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
I know.
No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)
Hey hey
Cmon lets go...
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
(gasp) An accident? What happened?
Oh. Are you alright?
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
[laughing]
Whatever.
Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
"Well, what kind of shirt was it.?"
Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
Oh, yeah.
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
Im just curious.
Kramer, what is wrong with you?
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
Enjoy. (she leaves)
That is not the point.
Donna Chang?
Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
I dont have five thousand dollars.
Very nice meeting you!
Yeah.
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
What happened? What took you so long?
Ga-ga? When did that happen?
Really?
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
(Smiling, proud) I said, "yeah."
I think she'd figure it out.
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
Ahh.
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
(improvising) I said, uh, some snuggly baby.
I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH)
I know.
No. In what way?
Hey, did you make the movie?
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
Custom designed?
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
I have a personal commitment.
where's Tony?
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
They rehearse all the time?
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
What's going on?
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
What do you mean?
Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
Why?
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
Give me the money.
Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned
I'll see you.
Oh, well I have to eat.
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
Someone I know.
See what?
Throw down your key.
(on intercom) It's Elaine.
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
You got the tickets right?
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
What?!
Yes.
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
Oh, that's fantastic.
Elaine Benes?
That's great George.
What was that look?
I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
Boy, you don't look good.
You speak Burmese?
Oh!
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
Tuna?
What?
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
Its time you got outta here anyway.
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
I would love to go upstairs.
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
Aha hu, You look *terrific*.
What's goin' on?
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
Yeah, worked out good.
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
(uh-oh) Her?
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
What are you gonna do down there?
Someone I know!
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
You can pick 'em up right now.
Really?
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
Hi! This is my friend George.
I know. I need a lesson.
(frustrated) Just go.
Superman can go back in time?
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
It's for George.
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
It's not serious, is it?
I thought you wore silk underwear.
Look out the window, you'll see.
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
Twenty-five percent.
What?
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
Who Gendason?
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
Nothing. He walked me home.
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
You didn't bring a brown sweater.
All right. I'm going I'm going
Now look, don't take too long.
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
Hey, have you seen Anna?
You want to work here?
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
Mmm... phenomenal peas.
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
Yeah that! So, . . .
What's all this?
Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?
How could you say something like that?!
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
why does she have to chew so many?
All right. Whiff away.
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
I never saw the statue.
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.
These things happen.
He wrote a song about it!
Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
I don't understand.
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
Yeah
H-his name?
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
Really?
What's wrong with him?
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
Did you do with the dogs?
It's possible.
Why? What happens if you don't order right?
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
Hello.
Ah, this. And that.
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
Huh?
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
something.. wrong?
You are amazing.
So what do you want me to do?
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
Hi Sheila.
Oh, hi Dan.
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
Yeah.
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
What happened?
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?
No they don't.
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials)
(to Paul) You're checking it out?
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
Why are you yelling at the TV?
Really cold.
Been a while?
So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.
It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
So when are we gonna eat?
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
You're not too cold?
Couldnt agree more.
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
Balloon bouquet? For who?
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
The executor? Of what?
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
You're right Maestro.
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
I thought you were hungry.
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
Jinx buy me a coke.
"Top of the Muffin to you!"?
She.
Jerry!
Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.
Eleven-thirty?
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
what is it?
Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
Right, Joe Divola
Christmas present? For who?
What?
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
Hey, where's Kramer?
Anybody here? Peterboy?
Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.
Cleaning supplies?
What are you doing with your old couch?
"He's smart...."
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
Then how did she find out, Jerry?!
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
Yeah.
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
Right.
What?
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
Really? Wow.
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
Oh, it's been a while.
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
No, it's from the store.
Interracial? Us?
Yeah.
You think I should have asked George?
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Where'd you get this?
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Did you talk about us?
Can it cut that thin?
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
Yeah, he did.
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
Yeah? What was it?
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
Where are we going?
Yeah, see ya.
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
Fat.
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
All I've got is grape juice.
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
No.
What...?
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
Yeah?
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?
What?
I do.
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
Oh no.
Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
(To George) Stay away from her.
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
What?
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
Oh, how's the baby?
Oh, fantastic.
He has to go. He may have killed her.
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
So what are you going to do?
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
Still?
Really!
I faked it.
Ohhh!
I can't take your bedroom.
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"
(gasps) How did you find it?
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
Yeah. It's surprising.
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
You still have no proof.
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
Oh, boy, I'm really scared!
Alright thats it! Were back together!
Why would he come to George?
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?
Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.
Well, can I introduce you as doctor?
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
(meekly) Yes ma'am.
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
Well, wait---wait a second.
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
What?
50
No, the Green Lantern.
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
Ah, right there, yeah.
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
Yeah
Well, I am the President.
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
And I want my keys back from you!
Pal? You think I'm your pal?
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
No?
get, um, started..
Do you want some of mine?
You mean in a real Fight Fight?
And scuba diving.
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
Yeah, it got pretty nasty.
What do you got, a cucumber?
It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.
Good-bye
I had to take it again.
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
Hi.
You're a baby!
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
I didn't pay attention.
Yeah, exactly, the "triangle" guy.
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
Oh, Mr. Pitt.
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
Happy Festivus, Georgie.
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
(Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!
Cows, well that's fascinating...
no it is not
I have to eat!
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
Difficult?
See what is that? Is that a date?
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
What are we gonna do there? Talk?
85?
Jerry?
What? What happened to the new Jerry?
I'm not mad.
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
No not quite.
Really.
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
Ahh-cnee.
So? Then what?
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
Thank-you.
Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?
Who's that?
Im kinda full.
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
Maybe.. All over your face!
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
Are you serious?
Hey, Joe Mayo.
I just said the same thing to you.
Oh, he's fine.
Mr. Peterman, I, uh...
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
We didn't come in over there!
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
It,s, it's up to you.
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
Why?
Just me and George?
Very funny. That's very funny.
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
Sssshhhhhh!!!
(impatient) Come on!
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
Oh.
Must have been an accident...
How long does a funeral take?
Oh, sure.
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
Yeah, she's a package full of something.
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing)
Very mature.
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
You're getting warm.
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?
Phoenix? Whats happening with his appartment?
What is that?
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
Yeah. I know. Me, too.
Hi.
The flight's been canceled?!?!
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
I am his nurse... Poloma.
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?
Yeah.
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
No that's Radio!
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
It's me.
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
'Cause he gave me his.
Well, relationships are very important to me.
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
Mmm!
Good. Now fix me a drink.
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
Hey, we told you not to park there!
"War and Peace."
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
'...singing a song, side by side...'
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
Go talk to her.
I turned him. He defected.
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
He's waving..
Hi!
They have big salads.
Aawwh Please.....
It's a hair.
(Giving up too easy) Okay.
What the hey.
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
This cantaloupe stinks.
What are you gonna do in there?
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
Can I fix that after lunch sir?
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
That's so, that's so sweet.
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
Oh, it stinks.
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
So go buy a new one.
You could have.
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
Hey George.
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
I can't believe you left your post.
You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know...
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
Ooh!
See, yeah, that's all I was saying.
What?
Uh, that's, ...
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
What?
Enchante.
Get out!
Are you actually considering this?
I've got Super Bowl fever.
Oh I didn't tell anyone.
Let me test-taste that. (tastes Jerry's yogurt)
Nice to meet you, too!
Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?
What're you doing?
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
(looks straight into his eyes) Jerry.
I can't have popcorn for dinner!
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
Oh, hi, Dad.
What? What are you talking about?
Your guy can't cross to my side?
Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
You flew here coach.
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
Hey.
I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
Ohh! Stop it! I know.
Copywriter.
(shakes head) No.
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
But she broke up with you.
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
What?
Why not?
What's that?
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
"I don't care"
Very much.
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
What are you doing?
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
I don't know.
All right. Let's go, to Reggies.
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
(urgent) Jerry? Jerry?
Oh my!
It's not bleak - it's springtime.
No, no, I'm leaving.
That's a pretty big tip...
I told ya'. He has ideas.
The mannequin!
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
I don't think so.
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
Um uh.
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
Can you believe this woman?
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
So what did he say?
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
We'll have to sleep head to toe.
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
Hi, Judy.
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
So, you think you're sponge-worthy?
Downtown New York?
Where are you going?
Vegetable Lasagna!
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
Oh.
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
What happened?
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carousel.
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
Oh, okay.
See'ya.
My manuscript?
Nice looking family.
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
Well, it's just one more day.
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
What?
You have a water bed?
No, I'm still working on it.
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
See ya'.
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
Why?
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.
Even though what?
No. A general guy.
I do.
Because you have an attitude.
Who's that?
Excuse me.
Jerry no, that's important to me.
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
Awwwwww.
you can't spare it??
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
Yes it is.
What? How?
Yeah, who's he?
Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.
Robin? No, why?
Eh...he'll get up...
That was so good.
(she fakes a strangling) RRR...
No.
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
Uh, don't worry, he's cool.
Thank you, Jackie.
Ooh, it's a cake walk.
Yeah, that's right.
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
This is it. I can take this anymore.
You're not going to do any walking.
Hi!
(whispering to George) You're up.
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
No!
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
You know you're chippin' in.
Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.
Why? What happened? Did you talk?
Sorry. Hello?
(big smile) Okay.
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
Joey? Joey?
Uhmmm huh! Is it important.?
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
He can really do that?
Yeah.
Oh...well...
Yes.
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
Thanks.
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
Burma?
Jeannie... your fiancee.
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
Good! I won't!
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
Ha! That's preposterous.
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
Why are you talking about my shoes?
Yup.
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
Why? What's wrong with it?
I think you're sticking it to me.
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
You think it's effeminate?
Three notes?
I know.
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
What's wrong?
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
No, I really don't.
Really? A fight with the foreman?
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine)
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
What are you doing in here with that?
Yeah? Like what?
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
I think I'll let you do it.
Oh, she got hurt.
What are you talking about?
We do what we can.
"I know that but why are you going?"
Um, what does Nana sound like?
It ever happened! Understand?
Kramer!
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
Just gimme your keys.
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, Kramer.
What?
Okay.
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
Fine.
hi, nice to meet you finally
Kramer, forget it.
Out.
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
Hey boys!
Watch out for that maroon Golf.
Thanks
Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
Well, you can't walk around like that.
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
It must be a mistake.
(Recognizing him) Peter?
What woman?
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.
Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
Did you give him the room number?
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
Do you think of anything?..
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
And he's has a bit of a rash.
Today?!
Babs?
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
No Mister Peterman.
Yeah. It is.
That will be fun.
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
I can't do that.
Lithe.
Come on.
No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
Seattle.
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
Yes, his name is Hal.
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
Her type? What type?
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
Jackie says put it on, Jerry.
Yeah! It's a social thing.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
Kramer, you look terrible.
Call Kramer.
You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.
Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
I cant remember.
Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
Faster.
Kramer, this is too big.
Really.
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
Ah, I know. I know...!
I don't mind skunk.
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
It is not necessary.
Uh-huh
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
"How so?"
C'mon..
Well, that's your problem.
But you said no more painting.
You took her medicine.
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
(indifferent) Yuh.
Yeah.
Will you turn around?
(exhales)
Oh, hi honey.
Huh, go ahead, tell him.
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
How's he gonna chew it?
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.
Really?
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
Noreen, are you crying?
You got me a note?
(Between chuckles) How is she?
In about twenty minutes.
James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!
(Agreeing) Mm.
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
Soup's not all that good anyway.
Hello?
Oh, man. We're stopping?
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
Hey.
*Get* *out*!
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
(hopeful) And?
Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!
In the back.
When was this?
I told him I was busy.
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
(accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you.
Hide!
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
Okay. We ready to go?
You have no idea.
So you're concerned.
You don't know?
Hello.
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
All right. Spill it, Jerome.
So, you weren't born here?
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
What was that?
Get off of me!!
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
Uh... (clears her throat) Rifkin.
Cheryl Miller's brother?
Kramer, what's wrong?
Jerry--
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
How high did I go?
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
How much do you want for it?
What do you care?
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
Let me think about it.
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
I'm sorry honey.
Nice to meet you, Poppie.
Nice to see..
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
I found it!
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
So where do you wanna eat?
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
Yep.
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
Hmm.
Is that good?
Yeah, I suppose I am.
The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.
Uh uh, you should go some time.
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
Albano is your last name.
"Aaaaaahhh! He is?!"
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
You're father was blacklisted?
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
Hello.
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
There is no park and the team has relocated.
Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?
No, no, no. You give me your number.
Well at least let George do it!
Oh.
You're nuts!
"Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye."
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
Just a little off the side...
You're welcome.
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
Just give it back to him.
You never said you were fighting children.
Huh!
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
Mmm, this is delicious.
Yes, Mr. Pitt?
Aren't you Raquel Welch?
... me to go.
They were?
(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
No. We were both in the mood for one.
Really? Grace?
Yeah?
(shrill) You're engaged!
yeah me too
Hello. (she enters)
You feeling jiff?
No, no, I'll be back.
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
Did he give you a reason?
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
I dunno, at least three weeks.
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
Well that's not sex.
Great.
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose)
Where's Beth?
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
Listen to me you little shi........
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
Right above you?
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
(giggling) Oh.
What about this candelabra?
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
Where did you get her?
Oh, yeah. What's that called?
Oh, see you tomorrow morning.
Hmm!
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!
Well I figured that's what couples do.
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
Shhhhhh!!!
You sure? Anything?
And the bush-women.
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
What, is that a rule?
No, he's just neat.
So we can go anywhere we want?
No idea.
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Why does he do that?
Well, I'm dating a communist.
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
You didn't say this to George, did you?
Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
George?
Yeah? So?
(Interested) Oh?
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
(dryly) Yeah, too bad.
So what movie are you guys seeing?
Do adults ever order the child-size?
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
Hi
Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
You found a hair in your Farina?
I'm afraid of dogs now.
Where?
(hopeful) Oh, you were?
Well we could ...
Well, I don't.
What is this?
My back.
Wow. You really have a terrible voice.
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
Oh come on.
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
Uh-huh.
You know we were here, ahead of you.
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
I just don't enjoy being with him.
I don't want to see her naked.
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
Cherry Binaca, it?s new.
Kramer, the vest just called.
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
Hi.
(right away) No. Second choice.
All right, sir.
You oughta at least take a look at it.
I'm not surprised.
Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me.
No its not. That really is true.
I can't get off the kishkas.
George is on his way up.
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
So what are their plans?
Yes I am.
Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer!
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
I'll have a cinnamon babka.
We found it. I can't believe it!
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
Alright, let's go, come on.
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
A bubble?
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
Not bad huh?
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
(downcast) Yeah.
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
Seriously, we don't.
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Hey Kramer, Kramer!
Hey.
Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?
(weary) Jerry!
Oh. Have you been out?
How is that?
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
Who are you, my uncle?
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
Really?
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
yeah
Why not? That's all I want.
Ah, . . .
What is so funny?
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
So you cant do both?
Uh-huh...
Um, yeah in my purse.
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
No they don't.
Thank you, Julie.
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
What's the matter?
Why not?
In the office.
I'm looking for Kramer.
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
An Armani suit?
Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)
Yeah.
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
but what else did they say
(laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
Yeah, like you must procreate.
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
Yes.
You punched who in the mouth?
Do you realize what youre saying?
(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.
"Elaine got a new dress."
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
Oh are you?!
Oh, Come on.
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
Get out of here! Why?
I've got no room.
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
Hi.
Hey.
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
I don't think so.
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
No,
(to Kramer) Yeah, so?
Three days.
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
You know, George, that's an onion.
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
"All right, I'm gone"
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
Oh, yeah.
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
(Nodding) Yeah, yeah..
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
Is he black?
Wow...
(Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?
Some ugly baby, huh?
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
Oh, the guy with cancer?
Yes, yes.
He went back.
Get out!
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
They drove away?
Hey, I didn't get one either.
"I do now."
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
Oh Tomorrow...?
People go to South America.
I might be Elaine.
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
No.
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
You took him over to Celia's?
All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
I'm going in .
(dismissive) Gene's trash.
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
It's that bad?
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
Hello.
Hi....???
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
(hands them over) You can have 'em.
Which ones?
Oh Kramer. (They embrace)
Alright, let's do it.
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
Yeah!
You got something on your mind?
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
You get out of here!
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
I thought he was deported.
Well we can take the car service from my office.
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
Yeah? What else?
What is that?
Sweater.
Leo. Has the doctor been in yet?
Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
He's guarding a suit?
Hey, "great" organizer you gave me.
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Hello.
(at the same time) Yes, yes.
I attend to his personal affairs.
We're straightening out?
Hey.
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
I don't want it.
That, had to be invented?
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
Hmm.
Really? When?
He thinks you're a phony?
It can be very frustrating.
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
Manuscript?
Hey, hey, hey!
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
You just left? What did you tell her?
Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?
Nah.
(Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.
The Tonight Show?
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
You want the money for the big salad, George?
(under her breath) Ya that'll happen)
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
Wha--?
Yeah, I'll take it.
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
400 sugar fix.
What--what did I say?
That's sounds pretty juvenile.
Because it's really nobody's business.
Yeah, but it's only three blocks.
That was two months ago.
You? I'm more responsible than you are!
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
So that's it?
Well, Fred asked me out.
We made plans.
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
(animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends.
Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
What?
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.
What are you doing with this couch?
Jerry, She looks exactly like you.
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
Newman plays tennis?
I wish I was dead.
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
Yeah. (sits down next to Susan)
(discouraged) Five days. Here.
Huh?
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
Don't worry, I...
There's nobody I can go with.
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
Ooh.
Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.
What's that?
Okey-dokey.
No that's the week after.
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
Dave, um, painted his face.
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
No, no.
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
How could that be the dog?
Uh, excuse me.
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
It's Elaine.
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
What shoving?!
Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go.
Wanna sit down?
Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
I can't believe you said that.
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
What's that?
Are you okay?
Absolutely.
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
Maybe he likes her.
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
I know.
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
Why?
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
So you say.
He was laughing?!
Really?
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
[delightedly] Oh! You "pillage and plunder"?
Oh! (comes to him)
(happy gasp) Oh.
I guess I'll just--
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
Oh, that's insane.
Yeah, yeah he is. (as she leaves)
What's so funny
It is obtrusive, isn't it?
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
It's me.
Kramer, we like her.
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
Mrs. Oliver?
Jon Voight? The actor?
(touched, she takes it) Aw, Glenn.
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
Why didn't you stop me?
That's it. That's it. Stop right here.
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
(Confused by her reaction) You are?
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
"It's me?" Isn't it a little premature?
(upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.
Where would I take the test?
You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!
Arghhh, look it's a fire! (cough)
It's nothing.
Oh. How much you got left?
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
(Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.
Why are you so concerned about this?
What's me?
Where did you get my chart?
That's a good idea.
Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms...
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
What about the party? What about the Drake?
(gets Kramer's point) Hah.
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
Wa',you don't have the directions?
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
(enters) Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.
I have no chance, do I?
Why is that name familiar?
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
What tell? What's a tell?
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
... date with Fred.
Fine!
What?
You know... (looking up) the spirit world.
uh huh (very quietly)
Robin!
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
Yeah, tell im George.
What? You're Cheryl Fong?
I thought that was pretty good, huh?
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
You lie.
(sarcasm) Alright, good job.
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
Because they're turning your teeth green?
Right...
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
Oh.
Yes.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
You can't! You can't do this now!
Sure, fine.
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
Hey. Oh, is that a label maker?
I can't say that.
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
Ohhhhh, that's great.
Isn't that a little...rash?
Ah nuts!
(Yelling out) He's got nothin'!
Oh! Where are you going?
Twisted? God, I did you a favor.
(quietly) What?
Well, you know. It's a picture?
So, what did he do?
I'm going to order Chinese Food.
Oh my god.
Why cant you sit in the middle?
So what did he have to say?
Oh..Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry, George, but it's true.
(to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?
Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
Hey. Is that your horse outside?
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
Hmm... No you don't.
Get out of my way, Jerry.
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
Ninety-five hundred.
Hello. This is Todd Gack.
We certainly have.
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
No. She died.
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Alright, alright.
(admiring gasp) Fabulous.
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
No. I can't smell it.
So was Mia Farrow there?
Yeah, yeah, thanks.
What? No, no, I'd rather...
Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue.
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
Oh, wasn't that terrible?
Oh, Maestro.
Wha...?
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
Wow! What a story.
Hey. What's going on?
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
Are you alright?
This. My office. Sam trashed my office.
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
No no no no, it's just...
Hi!.
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
Better, now.
What the hell does that mean?
Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
C'mon.
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
Yeah.
Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)
Got to *love* the Drake!
I guess.
Hi Peggy.
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
Isn't he the best?
Kramer.
Oooohh, what about me!
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
No, no, it does!
Ahh, yeah, sure.
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
(breathy) Bye.
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
Hello, darling.
*YOU* took my seat!?
Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
You know why? One word shade.
Yeah, Im gonna work on that
Say what? (laughing) Say what?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
George! It's cheating.
What?
(gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.
What's the difference?
Why?
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
(chuckles)
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
Hey.
Really?
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
Wha..wha...?
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
Aww.
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
How do I look, Jackie?
OK. I dont quite know
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
No. Today's *your* lucky day.
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
Ah.
You got me cash?
Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke!
Hi.
All right.
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
You know karate??
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
Ugh, the hell with 'em.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
Pardon?
What? What?
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
I've got that magazine article for you.
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
Hello.
Really? You really missed me?
Jerry?
Hey, it's me.
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
Yeah...
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
I'll put in a good word for you.
All right, ha ha
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
You're eye still hurts?
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
I just don't get it.
A wedding.
If only.
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
Hello.
Uh, I guess I hadn't--
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
Oh! The Risotto broad.
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
Yeah.
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
Ten minutes.
You look ridiculous in that thing.
How are you gonna widen the lanes?
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
No!
Hi.
Ok.
Yeah it is nice actually.
No. I'll just walk home.
Get it out!
Nope.
Hello? Vincent?
Oh, nothin'.
Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.
Thank you. (gets up from her seat)
JERRY Cosmo?
You stole her clock?
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
You can go.
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
What?
(English accent) Pardon?
Why couldn't you just wait?
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
She won't even give you a hint?
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
Peach.
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
What's to discuss?
I dont know.
Yeah. Right.
Yeah.
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
Are you calling me a liar?
Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
To please Mr. Pitt.
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
(Mocking) Yeah, I'll chew on that.
Right.
You don't know?
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
Jerrryyy, How can I go on?
Please, please. It's really, really itchy.
Id do it but I dont have any money.
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
Yeah.
You should run for mayor.
A LeBaron?
(to self in head) This is unbelievable..
Right.
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
You're very special.
Hi, Susan.
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
I mean, I can't give people orders!
What? Who told you that?
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
About five.
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
(laughs)
Okay, so fine. Go.
Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
You think?
(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
What was that all about?
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
Yeah, of course.
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
Oh, come on.
Right after ... that ...
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
So, you're gonna get a new couch?
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
Uhh, so frustrating!
Anything else?
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
Oh, please.
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
Yes, he is lazy.
Thank you...aah, hm mm.
I know!
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
Open your vault.
How can you possibly show your face there again?
930
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
What?
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.
(to George) Are you happy now?
No. Me neither.
What'd you have?
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I don't know!
You haven't told them yet, have you?
Oh, yeah...
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
You never get good haircuts.
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
How's it going'?
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
(SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?
Huh?
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
Hi E-an
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
What?!
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
Oh my god..
I know, he's so tiny!
Yeah, she'll be here any second.
No way.
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
All right. Witness? (looks at George).
Oh.
Yeah, I am so sorry.
Uh, this is,
[mind] This is getting awkward.
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
Ya know?
What's... medium?
Hey, Jean-Paul.
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
Oh.
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
Ah (hu ha - small laugh)
Do you think it's a coincidence?
But...Jake...
"Do you wanna go or not?"
KRAMER, are we doing a bad thing?
Hmm.
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
Yeah.
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
Kramer, is that you?
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
No.
Oh.
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
I see.
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
Hey. Hey everybody.
Pliers?
She's the one you went out with last night?
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
COSMO?
Jerry, Jerry.
What is a wig master?
(Shrugging it off) Oh, please.
Yeah!
Yeah. (startled)
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
Who told you this
Aah!
What's the name of this physical therapist?
(sighs) So how about that Aaron?
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
Well, he's not a baseball player.
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
Ready.
Yeah.
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
(laughs) What?s all this?
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
Hi Julie.
Good. Good. You?
Yeah.
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
Nervous?
Uh huh.
How ya doin'?
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
(to Nina) Hello!
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
I know.
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.
Oh god this tastes terrible.
Hi.
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
Yes, exactly.
Tell Ping I said hello.
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
It isn't?
hey
Yes it is!
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
(annoyed) Aww, nuts!
A Ziggy?
Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?
Hi.
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
He tells him which soap to use.
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
Ah...
What?
Yeah.
New couch? Why?
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
No thanks.
(worried) What? What?
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
And then he starts writing on my chart.
Well, uhm... I...
It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
What?
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
Oh, the date. The date.
Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
Where did you go?
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
Good night
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
Oh, baby.
Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?
I like coffee.
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
What about the look?
What?
You're... poor AND married?
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
I can't believe he hasn't called.
Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
I needed to move a bureau.
Yes! 915!
I dunno.
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
He's not ga-ga.
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
I dunno.
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
Was it blue?
What?!
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
Well done. (pats George on the shoulder)
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
No.
Come in, come in!
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
Uuh.
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
(shouts) Oh, go to hell!!
Who is it?
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
I dropped a grape.
How?
Were you just talking about me?
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
Yes. Who it this?
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
What? Why not?
What are you writing? Doctor.
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
Have you ever thought about it?
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
What? KRAMER, I'll do anything.
Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
Do you need anything?
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
Did you see that?!
What is this?
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
It's Elaine.
Hi!
There was a bit of an accident.
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
No, no, come on Michael!
What?
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
I'm having people over.
'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
No, it could get sexual.
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
That is so ridiculous.
Correct. (catches herself) What's that?
What do I need this for?
Some house, huh?
a ply?
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
What? Why not?
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
Search... for Spock?!
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
Hey Boys-O!
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
I know, it's not that.
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
How about, it sucked?
Egh, Jake Jarmel?
Hi!
No no, no no.
Told me what?!
What?
Me too.
I can't believe we broke up like that.
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
KRAMER!
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
(To Ping) I did not jaywalk.
We're with him, we're with him.
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
(pause) Man, Hands?
You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
I'm a "honey." He's pretty great, huh?
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
Yeah, yeah, right.
You already ate?
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
(warning) George.
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
A wedding? Have you lost it, man?
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
Joel...
What, you don't think she's beautiful?
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
Yeah, you can get a gardener.
hey
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
Yeah, pretty much.
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
(grabbing Puddy) What are you doing?
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
Oh, hello.
Pooh...(laughing)
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
Yeah, like a swoosh.
What?
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
I do to.
Well maybe I feel the same way.
Interesting.
There's some kasha.
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
What's the status?
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
Why? What happened?
Oh, sure.
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
So, what d'you think?
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
Oh...my God.
I'm sure it's right around here.
Oh, but it's ok for me?
Fine.
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
No, don't...
It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
And you're taking...
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
What is it?
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys.
Jerry!
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
Isn't that a little racist?
Hey, Arnie's just as upset.
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
What did I say?
(laughs) Yeah, right, youre the master packer.
Wha... W.. Are you going home?
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
You can't let him get away with that!
(dread) No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
What?
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
Oh uh uh...
What do they do?
Yes?
I know.
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
Bye.
No, I just have a cold.
I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
Mulligatawny?
Keep following him.
Hmmm, I dont think so.
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
Well what, what about your fact-checking job?
yeah
Why?
No, what?
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
"Ha...."
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
Well, what did you intend, Hal?
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
Ill take it!
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
I can't. I'm the best man.
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
Yeah yeah, ok.
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
I've got a confession to make.
You don't ask.. You tell.
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
(quietly) I,...
It's okay, you don't
But, Jake, I didn't...
(To Jerry) You tell him.
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
Hey.
(disappointed) Oh.
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
Oh, a puffy shirt.
Jerry Seinfeld.
No, no.
Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
(sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
Jerry, do I stink?
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
What about his comedy act?
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?
Come on, what is taking you so long?
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
Have a good game.
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
You said it was an emergency.
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
Oh my!
Why should I tell you?
Just in those commercials.
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
Melrose Place?
(To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?
Gone.
Hey.
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
It's a long story.
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
What was it?
yeah.
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
What did you think, that would impress me?
What? What is with all these books?
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
(worry) Oh no. What?
Well come here and take a look.
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.
I'm sorry... sorry.
(mouths silently) Okay.
Huh?
Sooo, how was your date?
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
Oops! (bumps into Levitan) 'Scuse me.
Then how are all these people getting together?
Oh yeah, the curse toast.
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
Why do they call it a wedgie?
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
Why?
Hey, is that real fur?
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
You're giving him *ten* dollars?
What?!!
Faux pas?
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
Nothing, and I've looked.
Oh, that creepy guy?
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
So tell me more about this game SIX.
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
What?
(Leaving Jerry) See ya.
Somethings going on here.
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
(she leaves hurriedly) I gotta gooo...
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
Oh, mine's "Ike".
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
So the trip was good?
Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
Sheets.
Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...
No.
Yeah, yeah.
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
Why can't he play for us?
AHhh. Thank you.
Yeah.
So you're giving him a discount too?
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
My God, are you okay?
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
No, we just met...
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
Hi.
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
You got me an apartment in the building?!
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
That is so stupid.
Ah come on
(Sarcastically) Oh, that is really mature.
What little deal?
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
Exactly.
Yep.
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
(flirtatious) Hi Jerry.
I didn't know you SMOKED.
This is it. Wish me luck.
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
Really?
Yeah.
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
Nowhere.
(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
Yeah, that's pretty good.
No?
Between a peck and a make out.
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
Oh...hi, Sidra -
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
Well, I, for one, really respect that.
Su-sie?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Real good!
It's a page number.
Uhh.
It is so forgotten.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!
So humm....When you gonna call her?
(big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
Come on!
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
Really? What is it about?
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
What d'you mean?
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
Oh, take 'em.
Six hundred and twenty million people died.
Call an ambulance.
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom)
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
What if it worked out?
Bye
(Confused) What is wrong with this book?
Bravo!
What about Georgie?
So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?
Jerry, I'm on the other line.
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
You'll do well, you're smart.
About three years.
Oh.
*No*, we would have heard it.
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
Come on. Let me see it.
(Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green.
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
Peter Jennings had one?
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
He said hed give me a lift.
Would you please?
Hey
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
Kramer!!
Sure. Water Pik, floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.
Which one is he?
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
Colors.
Bob!
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
[gasps]
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
Excuse me?
What did he say?
Really?
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
Hey. Hi Maestro.
What, are you in a bad mood?
Carefully?
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
No, these are saved.
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
Cocktail flu.
Ahhhhhh haa ha ha
C'mon
Now?!
So what?
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
Why?
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
This is his home?
(angrier) Thirteen thousand!
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
(Looking up from a menu) Yeah.
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
So then why are you seeing her again...
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
What?
(sighs)
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
Wait, what about your vomit streak?
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
No.
You can.
Hello.
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
Did you and Patty just break up?
Yeah.
(looking guiltier) No, nono.
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
(shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?
Hello.
George. How come you're whispering?
Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
Double or nothing.
Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.
(sighing) Again?
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
No, I guess you couldn't have..
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
What is that stain [on my coat]?
No, sir, I can't.
No, no, unfocus.
... hiking ...
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
Uh,
Right, I think its this
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
Or you.
Yep!
Oh, okay, go ahead.
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!
No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
I know!
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
I just didn't know you watched that.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
I'm going down there.
hates it
"He's performing at this AMCA benefit."
"I'm going to that!"
Aha ha ha (laugh)
That sounds urgent...
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend Paul.
Huh! Sexy?
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
Sure!
O.K. You start. What's your first choice?
Ohh...
He collects (holds up magazine) these?
Ohh... its snowing. Its beautiful.
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
(sighs Wa-ah) I don't know...a year?
Too tight?
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
Of course.
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
One million.
What?
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
What?!
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
You got it?
(sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo.
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
What'd they say? What'd they say?
Wow.
I think I might.
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
A what?
But what??
(as Darryl opens his door) Hey.
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
Okay.
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
Right there.
Thanks for the re-fill.
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
Oh, hi Greg.
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
What's his problem?
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
Grace?
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
My most, just heartfelt congratulations.
Forget it!
Yeah.
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
As long as you don't put...
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
Uh, (sob) thanks.
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
Noooo.
Yes it is level jumping.
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
You didn't know.
Theyre dying in the nets.
Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
Get movin'...
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
It's BOOKED Jerry!
You left your door open.
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
I thought I was alone.
What? What is that?
What? No, its not a big deal.
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
So, George... did you get the chair?
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
Bark.
What!?
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
What are you doing? What is that?
I am not your pal.
There you are!
We know what a face consists of.
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
What guy?
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
Nothing.
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
What's the difference?
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
Well, that's...that's sweet.
Hey, what do you think of this?
We've got a good team.
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
(quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it?
Then why didn't you take it?
So, will I see you later tonight?
I've got an alarm, ok?
That's what I'm saying.
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
No....Oh No....
Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.
Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
Are you going down?
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
What happened, what took you so long?!
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
Take a guess.
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
Terrific.
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
I dont know what your parents did to you.
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
"He thinks you're mentally challenged."
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
Great music.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
'Cos I'm not in the mood.
Books, Jerry.
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
What?
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
They don't get that much.
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
You gotta open the vault.
So what?
Don't be ridiculous.
(neutral) Fine.
Well I didn't know.
Sorry.
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
(Obviously not impressed, dull) Yeah, real nice.
All right, what the hell.
Oh my God.
I don't think so.
Good luck.
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
(To Anna) Get in the car.
(indicating) That's her. That's her.
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
I cut it.
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
I know.
Hey what's that?
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
I hate the good ones.
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
Aaron
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
Me? Why me?
Who is it?
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
Ha ha ha ha.
Im doing great.
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
No, because I slept with my back to him.
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
Since when?
What's `medium'?
No! I won't be a party to this.
I really like the city.
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
Because I was gooood.
So, waddya' going to do?
Should I do it, George?
They want five thousand dollars now.
But you said it was in the store!.
(thrilled) She died?!
Yes, I would say.
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
You encouraged her to get one.
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
Hey.
Are the clubs there?
Hello?
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
Excuse me.
Eh.
What?
Cash?
Hellllllooooo.
Hey, what do you think?
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
How can I do that?
Milhouse.
So we're having dinner tonight?
Just a hunch.
That's because I thought you were black.
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)
Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
It's not just hair! Look!
I'm gonna do a little firing.
(reading) At the Knights of Columbus?
No, but... it is very nice to know.
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
Mmmnn, Georgie!
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
Because it's insane?
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
What did he do about it?
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
How kind of you.
Whoa.
You did didn't you.
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
George...
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
What? Clinging to some scraps?
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
Uh-hu. And do you know what happened?
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
Delish. You know, short for delicious.
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...
I don't know.
You gotta follow that car!
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
Wait, what pizza place idea?
Is this Noreen?
Ohio?
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
You know, it's not really that terrible.
Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?
Me too
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
(Nodding) The other guy.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
Who was that?
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
Hey. What's this.?.
Come on up.
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
Yeah.
Hi.
Just, very interesting.
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
Do you have twenty bucks?
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
Who wants cupcake?
What?
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
He's sixty-six years old.
Yeah, I called him Maestro.
She keeps track of everything.
Okay.
How do you know?
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
Yeah.
Oh!
a square?
You.
Why dont you just ask her parents?
Hey.
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
(still in disbelief) You painted your face?
Where did that come from?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?
My father, really? I had no idea.
Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
Uhhh...
(to everyone) Oh, that's the Mohel.
What air conditioner?
I like feet too. Im just saying
Yes.
That's a rat hat?
Well, one of those glasses.
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
Jerry Seinfeld.
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
Whats going on? What is that look?
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
Hi.
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
Whar about Kramer?
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
(gasps)
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
Him? Him who?
(to George) Ya see?
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
Ilene.
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
What?
I'm waiting.
I believe that's the new minimum wage.
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
Really? What're the other titles?
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
I got stuff to do.
George! [waves hi]
What? What happened?
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
The black and white?
I don't know.
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Oh...
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Hey.
But it's Saturday.
I think so.
Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down)
You're crazy.
Why? Is it irrevocable?
Shall we stop and say hi?
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
How'd it go? George?
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
No.
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
During Schindler's List?
Chicken wing shoulder blades.
(Between laughs) What is that?!
Noreen, were you hitting on him?
All right. Take it easy.
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
So what did you say?
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
Huh?
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
Are you sure?
that's right honey, and I know you!
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
Yeah. Okay.
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
Do you have to?
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
I dunno.
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
Did you get a thank you wave?
Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
Anyway, so how was the dinner?
Yeah, yeah.
Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
Well... the counter...was right there, and...
How's that gonna happen?
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
(screams).
But I, I can't go alone!
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
Uh,
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
What, Ocean.
Im going to get some popcorn.
What? A health plan?
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
Kramer has a record.
Where were you today?
No, no, that's okay, it's uh...
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
(surprised) George!
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
Did he get it?
Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
Opium?
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
Where are you going?
Here's a thought - Bye bye.
Hey.
(wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
Uh oh.
Can he fix it?
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
That's impossible...
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
Tomorrow .
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
Don't worry. We won't forget!
I think they look good!
(to George) Hey.
"Well. Were you tucked?"
Get offa me!
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
Tomorrow evening, sure.
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
(Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
Aren't you too young to be bitter?
Peterman is gonna kill me.
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
No. You got the wrong number, kid.
(meek) Yes ma'am.
"Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those..."
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
For this couch?!
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
It is funny.
(Through intercom) It's Elaine.
She's not gonna twirl--
So?
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh)
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
You ditched the fur?
Thank you. Ow!
What is that?
NO.
Are you doing new material?
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
What? What are you trying to say, George?
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
Where's my chart? Did you get it?
It's Elaine Marie Benes.
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
Yeah.
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
What?
Jerry, ... He's a GUY!
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
I got a pebble.
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
Aaalright!
Why?
Mmm. De-lish.
I don't wanna!
What?
I think it would be romantic.
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
What is a bender anyhow?
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
Its disgusting.
Hey, how we doin' on time?
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
Yeah.
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
We should be able to get across right through here!
Shot.
I am never going back to the movies again
Jerry's a nazi?!
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
(shocked) Blaine!?
(very reluctant) Okay.
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
Yes it is
What?
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
What?
Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
No. Stay! Stay. Stay.
No, no.
Mr Peterman, you...
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
Do you want your old couch back?
What?
It's almost stupid if we didn't.
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
How is it talking?
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
Oh, all right, James. He he he
What? Wheren't they just here?
Ohh, I got your coffee.
Oh, gimme a break..
Oh, I'm not, uh...
And... what would those be?
Set.
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
Yep.
Oh, you come on.
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
It was a joke...
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
What?
Huh.
Hey.
Well...Poppie. I think differently.
Hi.
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
Uh huh.
Oh quite.
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
Can I just have the name...
Really? You really think I should fire her?
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
Im not moving in.
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
(gleeful) The fish!
Fine.
Oh hi, Sue Ellen.
I dont think so David, were through.
The Soup Nazi!
Kurt!
Hello.
Nothing.
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
Hi!
Oh.
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
You got that right.
Mr. Peterman?
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
Yeah? Well, so am I!
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
Hi.
David, um, I..
Hey, what's going on?
Ohh!
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
(Confused) What combination?
Who?
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
Well I have to interview a Mohel.
No, actually, you're not being funny now.
But it's cold out.
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
And vodka.
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
How much did he save?
I can't go.
You heard me. Strip!
I am never gonna fall asleep.
Hi.
No, of course not.
What did she say?
I won't.
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
Sara Sitarides?
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning)
Oh. Thank you.
Hey, What are you doing out here?
You would do that?
(pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
What is wrong with George?
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
Yes.
Who is this?
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
Uh, it's a riot Alice.
You sure you don't need any help?
Yeah.
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
Yes, he is dumb.
[Proudly] Really?
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
I am not buying a computer from you.
Hi.
Yeah?
What? Why not?
Why does it shrink?
Isn't that blue car him?
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
(impatient) Get out!
I had the roast beef
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
They deliver it.
I don't know. Chuck it?
I know he belches a lot.
Would you just, let it go?
Mmm, nice to meet you.
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
Oh, I dont know..
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
Yeah. What, is it a problem?
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
Deal with it. Be a man!
Yep.
This food was in the shower with you?
Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
(Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
What? Why?
But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.
Well ...
Then why are we calling?
I wouldn't be comfortable.
I need those clubs.
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
Oh, no! Come on Jerry.
Wow, look at that ring.
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
Mr. Costanza, I,
Where is the ambulance?!
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
Ohhh! Golden Boy?
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
Did you find the place alright?
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
Yeah?
Im not so sure he wants one.
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
Who is it?
What call?
"What are you talking about?"
Really?
Just get the car!
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
10th
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
How do you do that?
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
What did you have to say that for?
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
Oh, dear.
All right, what time do you want me back here.
What-- What are you looking at me for?
(on the buzzer) Buzz me.
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
Is it *real* butter?
Hi.
Are you?
Mm. This food is fantastic.
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
Well it was easy. Really.
Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
What else have you got?
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
He's coming up?
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
Why?
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
The hit and run!
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
What kind of shopping?
Uh, does it matter if it's melted?
Okay, I'm done.
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
Oh really, you like 'em?
I'll pay for it.
Are you OK? What? What?
You have a little thing for this fella'?
There, we just talked business.
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
(Embarrassed) Free sub.
No, milk.
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
You don't like her?
George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
Come on, father, you can make it.
Huh.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
(looks at it) TV Guide?
Why? You don't wear glasses.
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
You don't need us.
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
Yeah, I think I might.
So, what do you think?
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
I know.
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
Oh. So, you're pretty religious?
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
Hi.
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
Excuse me.
They were stolen.
What did he do?
Don't say that!
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
Like ...humm...How did she sound?
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
And you feel you're not really ready for,
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
I don't eat Oreos.
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
Um...as far as I know.
Cosmo, Cosmo?
What list?
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
Huh. (pause) Oh my god.
He does, how'd you know that?
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
Well podiatrist.
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
(to George) I'm gettin' his mail.
(Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.
These are terrible.
You get yours out, I was here first!
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
Yeah, alright, I gotta go.
So? What'd they say?
Come in.
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
So, what's that?
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
Yeah, that's right!
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
What is the matter?
(grasping the concept) Ohh.
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
What?
John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
We know the terrain.
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
Huh?
Alright, I'm heading over right now.
Hi. (she flips her hair)
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
Look, just because I'm a woman...
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
Who is that?
(to self in head) Bizarro world..
Yes! I'm a writer.
Jerry? Jerry!
Do you go in the shower?
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
HUH, so should you.
Twenty sponges should be plenty.
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
There's no Big Salad.
they-they took it from Tolstoy.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
Pocketbook or a handbag?
What?
Well, there's a doctor right here.
Hello, Frank.
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
What do you do?
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Goodbye?
I have no idea.
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
Hi.
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
Why not?
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
Oh ya.
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
Anyway...they're real.
Tell me!
Ah! Ah!ah!
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Well, no, I would hardly--
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
I thought he was Kramer's friend.
What? What did I do?
You can say that again.
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
Whew that was a dozy.
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
Mr. Lippman, how are you?
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
Yeah, I'd like to place an order.
what is with the gum?
It's invisible.
Listen, was Russell at the casting?
(neutral) Alright.
It doesn't matter.
He's a musician.
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
Makes you wonder, though, doesnt it?
I thought my idea was just as good.
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
Hear what?
(surprised) Brett? Everything alright?
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
Oh.
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
"Mrs. Onassis's"? That's hard to pronounce.
(Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite.
(raising her hand) Scuse me, master packer...
I don't believe this.
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
Stunned by soup?
Can he do that?
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
No, he wants to torture me.
So where are we staying?
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
Eat your soup!
We'll see it Sunday.
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
So, thats why were not together anymore.
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
Kramer.
ooooh ahhh
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
Who wouldn't taste a pie?
I guess.
Kramer, what's the matter with you?
Of course Id pay you back..
So what are you going to do?
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
Then why get the massage?
Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
Yeah I am still holding.
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
(LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
Oh good.
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
I'm gonna faint...
Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?
What?
What was that?
hi
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
Thought it would be nice.
Really?
Bye Eeeen.
Yay!
Ah, well.
Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
I got some for you.
Yeah me too.
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
I did?
Where you going?
Oh please no more.
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
I wouldn't sign one.
Yes, yes Mr. Mandel.
Huh.
You didnt.
Oh, wonderful!
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
Me either.
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
You don't have the label maker, do you?
No one.
Why?
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
Yeah! You're probably right.
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
There he is.
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
Did you say goiter? What goiter?
You sure you want his face?
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
Jerry, look at my fish.
Hey!
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
Right.
Jerry, I've always loved ..u..
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
But we need you.
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
For nothing..
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
What?
You look a little stressed.
You didn't hear me buzzing?
What?
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
(laughing).
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
No thanks.
We just got along *so* great.
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
Are you sure?
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
(determined) Eleven thousand!
Jerry?!
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
I don't want to keep him waiting...
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
it's Elaine
No, I can't.
What's wrong?
I think he does too
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
Yes.
Noo!
How can I go?
Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
I met him.
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
Oh, all right.
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
What?
..And then there were three.
George!
What is this, a 'bit'?
He's not THAT religious.
Hi, it's me.
(confused) Jimmy legs?
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
That's not gonna do anything.
Book it.
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
Jerry. Oh there - -
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
Hey Jerr...
Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
Ach, maybe.
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
So?
Because it's rude, otherwise.
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
I'm marchin'. (Enter George)
What's the matter with you?
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
Oh my god.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
Yeah, they don't know.
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
Ohh, what is the point?
Yeah.
Hello.
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
Oh I did?
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
No, but that's one problem. Why?
I thought George was meeting us here?
Ned must have left it here.
You know, that button looks very familiar.
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
Nooo, the other thing.
Ok.
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
(passing him the ketchup) Oh, sure.
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
Yeah.
No. Do you ever think about it?
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
[gasps]
Hello, Jerry.
Whatever.
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
I'm just thinking about the question.
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.
Uh... I...
No, No....Yesss!!!!!!
Saturday.
They have a big salad.
Oh.
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
Ugghh.
Aaron? Aaron are you ok?
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Youre pregnant.
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
You should show this to Georgie.
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
Fusilli Jerry?
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
yeah.
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
You want one?
Maybe we could all have dinner later?
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
An IQ test.
How did you...
We have to replace the couch.
Why? Because I can?
Oh, no, it's okay.
How do you feel?
Have you gone in there?
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
Bye.
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
I didn't say anything.
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
(bearing up) I'm fine.
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
O.K. O.K. Remy.
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
Yeah! hmmm..I gotta go..
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
It's supposed to feel good.
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
Well, I couldn't help it. "Moland Spring"?
Where's my drink?
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
Is George here?
All right, pile it on.
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
Well, who's gonna call?
Ill be right back.
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
Good.
Hello!
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
You're still here. You're a dynamo.
Well, Here we are.
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
Mm, love Farbman.
(quietly) No, no, no, I can cancel.
I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
What about George?
Are you coming with me?
Why should you get the first class?
You want to bet?
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
You can't be bleak in spring.
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
Exactly.
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
What?
What
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...
Oh, right.
Well, come on we're on vacation.
Yeah.
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
Hey, I did it.
[gives up] Yeah, exactly...
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
George, I just don't want you interfering.
What're you getting?
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
W..well, can't I come in?
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
Cookies?
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
You mean..?
(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
What are you guys doing here?
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
Oh-kay. Gimme the large.
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
Well, it's just two hours by plane...
Hey!
Her too.

I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
(MUMBLES) That's just about enough
You think Ihave grace?
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
Yeah. Hah.
Now what was that?
Oh. Ok. Thank you.
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
So where do you get this note?
Uh-huh.
Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
Yessiree Bob.
Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.
No. Your. (breathes)
Yup, you mean him?
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
You haven't told him?
See, what did I tell ya?
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
Mm-hmm.
I think he's got ideas.
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
Oh. Big room?
Hi George. Hi Jimmy.
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
The one you broke the plans with tonight?
A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
Ghandhi?
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
Yes.
(makes an irked noise)
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
I don't know if I can.
excuse me, do you have a tissue?
Yeah. What is this all about
What?
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
No, I just..
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
It.
I was just kiddin, around.......
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
Those are JFK's golf clubs!
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
Well, why didn't you say no!!
Really. Why?
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
Ah, no.
What?
Well he frightened me.
A *lot* of weight. (enthusiastically)
Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous.
What is this?
(accepting) Okay, okay.
Exactly.
Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.
All right. I'll be back.
I said I'm sorry.
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
I lied
except for Jerry!(laughs)
The astronauts use them.
Casus belli.
Oh my God!
It took him like ten seconds!
Judy .
How much did you pay for them?
It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
Got it.
you know (acts like a monster)
Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
Theres no Rubber Man.
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
Oh, they won't?
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
I really think it's the size of your neck.
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
No.
I don't know.
Shove it!
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
You've been an enormous help.
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
Ellis.
my god, you didn't.
How close do you get?
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
Oh
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
This is my bike!
Showering?
I hear ya, Sister.
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
Kramer.
No. I don't want him looking.
What do you wanna know?
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
Ahh.
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
He'll be here.
You flinched.
At least it wasn't atomic.
(awed) Oh, look at this!
What? What, you dont want to go now?
Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem.
Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.
Uh, Kramer...
So?
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
Just hold on!
I staked out his health club.
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.
What are you talking about?
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
(annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing)
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
So?
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
Ask Jerry.
You went to see her?
Hey.
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
(Chuckles)
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
It's me.
Forty bucks? Are they Sable?
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.
What happened to Bob Saccamano?
And Ill be right upstairs?
(Through intercom) Yeah.
Steve.
Fine, go away.
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
Nothing, nothing.
Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
No!
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
No.
Yeah..Yeah...
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
Hello, Tim.
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
(turning to them, awkward) It's locked..
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
What?
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
Which one is he?
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
No, I don't want the man either.
(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
Yeah.
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
Hello?
What's the matter?
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Will you just park it already?
She.. was.
Uh. Does he live underwater?
No!
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
Would you change yours?
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
(pause) Bizarro Jerry?
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
What're you looking at?
I...I don't know...
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)
(not amused) All right.
You want it?
I realize that.
Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
What is with him?
Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff.
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
(Whispering to Jerry) Hey.
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
Couldnt be happier.
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Why do you have a bug guy?
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
He's incredible.
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Well.
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
I can be very clever.
It's right over there.
The look you just gave me.
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
Thanks
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
I'm white.
Oh, Please.
Some night, huh?
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
Whhhy?
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
Oh, I don't remember them.
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
I don't know, I guess.
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
Yeah, I suppose.
This is all very exciting.
What did you do that for?
News? What news?
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
She stopped performing.
(whispers) Poor bastard.
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
No.
What? What is goin' on with you two?
YES! yes. You saw him on TV.
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
Televising opera?
Kramer!
Ah Oh!!
I said, All Right.
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Why is that beautiful?
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?
Okay... bathroom....kitchen.
Yeah, right.
Oh my God. You're crying.
But she was fifteen.
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
George I was just kidding around.
Kramer, it's...
Hello
What?
Oh It must be my new organizer.
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
Nope.
Hey!
I guess.
Yeah, talked earlier.
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
Hellllloo.
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
On occasion.
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
That was nothing.
What about the couch?
So, where's Todd?
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
Some friend of his from England.
Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?
Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally.
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
What?
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.)
Ok....
Oooh no, I don't think so.
No.
Well, that's because you're an idiot.
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
Yeah. It is kind of cool.
What could happen?
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
Yeah, I know.
Right there.
(to Myra) He's very highly recommended. So...
(to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.
We're down here! Help!
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
Can you let go of my tongue now?
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
(grudging) Alright.
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
Really?
What? What is so funny?
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
(Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?
Aah! Okaaay.
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Better call the zoo.
Siena?
It's a classic.
No it isn't.
(rolling her eyes) Lithe!
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
Oh, lovely.
Lena Small?
(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.
What are you saying?
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
OKAY!!!
I mean, stranger things have happened...
So I'm not gonna be an usher?
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
Ahem. 646? What is this?
Oh! I forgot to tell you--
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
Good morning, Jackie.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
Is that the right word?
Yeah. That's him.
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
I say, it's a peach.
Yeah, that's right.
(to Jerry) Five more days?
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
How do you know his name?
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.
George, I cannot believe...
Its that bad?
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
It's PLO blend.
No!
Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?
"Who's the Drake"?
this isn't a very good time George
uh, ha.
Oh...nuts.
Oh. Well, Usha.
Thank god I found you..
Was that Tim Whatley?
Ellis and Alex aren't even close.
How could this have happened?
Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
Hmm. Sickies.
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
Oh no.
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
No, hes driving back to Maryland tonight.
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
What letter?
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
Yeah. That's what I just said.
What's your line?
Bye.
I'm sure they're not.
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
Well what happened when you raced him again?
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
I got a date.
Alright. Forget it!
Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
Can you believe him?
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
Correct.
Wrong side?
(Extremely excited) The other guy?!
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
What's it?
So what're you gonna do?
Yeah, how's the doctor date?
What's the order?
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
(Overly generous) Hi, David!
Where did you get all these pictures?
You know that guy downstairs?
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
She said you're getting together Saturday night!
"Well.... (pointing at him) Jimmy!"
Why don't you just shut the f-
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
What did he have to say?
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
Well.
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!
(fierce) I will!
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
George, please.
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
Ah.
Uhm, I just have a question.
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
No.
So, whatd she say?
Well I have to be going.
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
(distractedly) Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make...
(pause) Oh. That's nice.
Oh, of course! She's deranged.
Anna...
All right! You know what, just forget it!
Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
"your shirt was out?"
You have no idea?
You know the Three Tenors?
Really?
Yeah, you know (scratches cheek and sniffs)
It's the next best thing to being alone.
Yeah, yeah.
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
I am speechless. I am without speech.
Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
Do I know anyone??
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
It's the play button, off his VCR.
(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?
Really.
What do you think?
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
Yeah.
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
Almost.
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
I beg to differ.
I didn't take your napkins.
Jerry, the man is a doctor.
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
Do you want something to read?
I am?
Excuse me...
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
Was it a cup or a bowl?
Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
(Casually playing along) So what?
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
It's disgusting.
(to the black waitress) Long day?
Hi, Mr Peterman.
What could I be saying?
Brett?
Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition.
You know, I'm going as a beard.
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
Ever.
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
Well Jerry told me that you did.
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
Unless youre married to a dictator.
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
That was good. That was very good.
what about it?
Uhmm...
You are!?!
think Tony, think
I dont care, Im not hungry.
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
Hey.
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
Like... (doing it) Like this?
The Drakette took it.
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
Um, well what's the difference?
(OC) It's me.
This.
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
(off-camera) It's Lainey!
Roy!
Kicked out?! Why?!
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
I thought she was the one.
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
Yeah, she was an editor.
Now those look good, they're very bold.
And... hes hilarious.
I think it's OK.
I'll say.
(Leaving) That's fantastic.
How old are you?
Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
My leg looks pretty bad.
what?
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
He's not my boyfriend.
Let's make it fifty.
Dick was fired.
(Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
What's the difference?!!
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
JERRY Hey
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)
But he's okay?
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
Jerry, talk to that guy again.
Diapers.
Hey.
Well, how could he do that?
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
It's Elaine.
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
Yeah, especially those frames.
Hi.
Yeah, that's him.
Home.
It was an accident!
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
Uh hu.
What?
What?
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
Portuguese?
Is he black..
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
What?
With the Chinese woman?!
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
Ah. ...Yeah.
and here.
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
But he used a condom, right?
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
Excuse me?
Do you mind?
(Blunt, to the point) No.
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
But you lied first.
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) Mm-hm.
So what'd you do last night?
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
No, thats a big coincidence.
Uhh, I don't think so.
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
(laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
Aaahhhhh!!
Hi, Greg.
Well, it's just a first draft!
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
No, he's not.
How much is this?
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
Boys are sick.
Do any of these look close?
no no , ..
Was it my fault?
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
Hey, did you get a massage yet?
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
Great!
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
Yeah, really great.
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
"Ahum!"
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
So?
EZ Bake oven?
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
Oh that's origi-
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
You got any room on that thing?
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
We were just trying to help.
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
Huh . So What's it about?
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
Yea why not?
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
Wow, invitations again...
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
What?
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
Let's start the bidding.
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
David and I will not be getting back together.
Really, what was the first?
How did you do that?
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
These aren't my keys!
(smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon.
You did.
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
What are you doing?
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
Hey.
It was..uh.. John-John.
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
Aha.
Hi boys.
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
Hey! Gail!
Thank you.
That's good...
Oh, go down and get them.
Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)
It's just a stupid movie.
No, I need it.
Wait a--
Yeah!
Maybe I should just get married.
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?
Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
Yeah, the jewel thief.
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
is it?
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
Isn't it going the other way?
It's me!
That's what I said.
You can't ask a person to change their name.
What's the matter with him?
He did.
Oh no, thank you.
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
Ohh!
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
Who's he?
Well, go, go.
Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...
So they don't want a baby?
(looking at Jerry) Ohh.
Jerry!
Right, well...
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
Run down your case for me again...?
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
Nedda?
Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
I said rubber fire.
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
I'll catch it!
So? What happened?
No. What about him?
Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
(looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen...
Hey!
(To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
No, Castro.
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
The Truth!, You want The Truth?
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
It.
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
Get out! What'd you do?
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
Yea, I guess that could work.
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
Hey.
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
Well...
She's not Chinese?
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
Yeah
Oh!
I don,t think so.
What? Just 'cause of that?
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
(points) I like Witchy Woman.
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
Hi.
You're quitting?
I still don't see what the big deal is.
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
Todd.
Thank you very much.
(angry shout) Kramer!
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
Must wean.
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
Oh god.
He told you all that? How could he?
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
Who's stopping you?
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
Well maybe you should call him.
No, Chinese.
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
Ohhh, it's coming in already!
I gotta go talk to him.
Well,
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
Oh, that's nice!
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.
Yeah, so?
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
Hi!
Do you mean "reer?"
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
This car.
because of the gum
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
We don't walk that fast...
It... works!
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
I have to live in a cave.
Jerry, give him the keys back.
No, who?
(Sourly) I'll make a note of it.
I'm marchin' in.
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
All time.
Jerry.
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
Is this gonna hurt?
I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
What? What?...
Hey.
Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
No, I don't think so.
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
what?
E-an
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
I *loooove* horse manure.
Jerry!
Why?
Get that out of my face.
(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.
No.
Maybe it's the cold weather.
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
Who's Sally?
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
Waddya' write?
What?
Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
Rules.
I bet your parents were upset, huh?
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
What is going on with you two?
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
Again you are telling me to shut up?
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
So you don't know anything?
I went to visit him.
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
They make it longer?
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
(neutral) Okay.
Oh she's fat?
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
No.
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
G'night, Jugdish. (Laughs)
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
I though I'd never find it.
What are you doing?
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
David
Im leaving.
(seriously worried) Wha...?
Dumb and lazy, I understand.
Is that the supermodel?
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
Oh, congratulations
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
(warning) Jerry.
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
Jerry...
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
(sitting down in the booth) 'Kay.
Ya.
(gesturing) There's this.
Vincent?
It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
He used to be called Peter.
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
I gotta go return something...
Boy, he takes such a long time.
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
His place...
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
What?
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
Just gimme twenty bucks.
No no - me first.
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
Yeah, right.
Well, he looks like a man.
I am an associate.
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
I don't think so.
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
Yeah.
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
What about Switzerland?
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
No, Alec Berg.
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
Well what do you want to give him, change?
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
Hello?
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
Oh, cristal clear!
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
The CABIN is on fire!
Who's Reilly?
The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
You think we're far enough.
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
Fine.
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
Oh, no. Don't!
Me, either!
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
I didnt get that joke either.
It looks exactly like me.
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
Who?
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
I know.
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
So, what are you saying?
Hi.
Okay, this is quite a place.
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
All right and that just about... does it.
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
Well, uh, fan. My father--
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
Bye-bye.
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?
Ok, ok ok ...
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
Joe DiMaggio?
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
No, No...
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!
What?
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
I kinda like her.
Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
And he's dunking!
Oh, I know! It is awful!
Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
Ah.
Aren't you?
Kramer...
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
(slower and louder) I'm kind of swamped.
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
Right! In fact... No, never mind...
Yeah, but come on . . .
I can't believe you ski!
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
(like a little girl) Okay...
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
Hey!
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
Get a hold of yourself!
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
So, how did it end?
But, that didn't happen to you.
Kissing is not sex.
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
He is?
Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
Theyre coming in?
It's not such a bad name.
Hey Todd.
I'm plumb out.
Yeah sure.
I wonder what happened?
I think it's a mistake.
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
What kind of soup did he get?
Well I trust people not to do that.
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
Because, it is what she does.
What d'you care?
Well..hum...let me rephrase that, She said....
It's your house.
Yeah? Well, I got news for you.
Why is she doing this?
The sax player?
Huh.
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
Uh.. I?m Elaine!
You sure you don't mind?
Paul?
Oh-oh, but-
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
This, that, and the other.
No, No that's my purse!
(Enters) Hey, what happened to you?
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
When's Rachel comin' out?
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
She did? Oh, that's so great!
Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
How long have you two been together?
Oh, I missed you!
I heard him contend that.
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
Yeah.
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
No, not at all...
Yeah, I don't know what that means.
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
(vicious) Fifteen thousand!!
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
So this is never gonna stop?
Well then what?
What?
Oh, well that's just *great!*
Yes.
I guess it was just a matter of time.
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
(enters) Hey.
Hey, have you ever fasted?
Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.
There is no he.
What? I can't hear you.
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
so huh, what did the doctors say?
Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
What?
(to Kramer) ...Kramer.
Oh thats nothing. Um and anyway um
Yeah.
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
Alright, that's enough of this.
(Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
Do you?
Ugh!
Yeah.
Ya
What do you want!?
Yeah...Jake Jarmel.
What, are you into this?
What?
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
What?!
Oh that's a nice store.
My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
Whats that?
I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?
(with pain) Hi Evelyn.
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
Uuhhh.
They're signing the papers next week.
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
What?
Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?
How do you know that?
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
I wish.
I wish I could quit...
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
What d'you think?
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
Well...
Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
Five minutes? That's it?
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
Oh, I
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
Disappointed?
(feeling sick) Yeah! go ahead.
I never should have given Anna the impression--
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
Nuthin'. Then he took me home.
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
That's the janitor closet, across the street.
Oh yeah? How'd you do?
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
I did.
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
What the hell is this? Where are you?
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
Oh, no...that won't last.
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
First the sucking then the weaning.
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
Bye.
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
I'd rather not say.
Ah, what're you doing here?
Okay, welp... see you around.
Oh, God!
Hey! George look at this.
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
Come in, come in.
Well, at least you're not bitter.
Ah, look who's here. "Silicon Valley."
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
yeah, all right ok
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
All right.
Shut up...
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
What butcher?
So what?
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
That's at the airport, right?
Very near.
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
Yeah.
Hey.
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
Hey!
The New Yorker has poetry.
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
So you consider this a relationship?
Should you be smoking?
I don't like to talk during a massage.
Huuh, Wow.
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
Oh, all right.
(gasp)
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
So how long did they drag you?
I know.
Oh, you have to say something.
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
I don't like this, it is to easy.
Yeah!
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
And the bathroom in your apartment?
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
Well if you want it, you get it.
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
Mr. Peterman?
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
Just some?
Oh, sure.
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
(Between laughs) Jugdish.
He's good.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
So, I understand youre moving to Phoenix?
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
Why don't I give you my phone number?
What's your Problem?
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
Yeah.
I said it.
Cookies?
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
You're going to the Tony's too?
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
Can I offer you anything to drink?
I'd stick.
Out, damn heal!
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
What's with him?
You always break even.
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
Worked?
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
You signed the release.
That's okay.
You're not taking me back?
My roommate has Lyme disease.
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
Party of four? Who are we meeting?
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
Right.
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
What? JERRY Where's the car?
Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
Uuuhm, all the time.
Cinnamon babka.
Oh Jerry, dont blow this for me.
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
Good.
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
Right. African.
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
Yeah.
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
Really?
Nothing.
uhn... Sorry!
Wha'd you come in here for?
I know.
(from a distance) Hey.
Yeah, you know, head to toe.
Well they're perfectly edible.
So what are we gonna get him?
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
Binaca?
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
(emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs)
(Sincere) I'm sorry.
All shell think is that you like her.
Bye.
Are you sure you want us here for this?
I'm sure he was just joking around.
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
Well, thank you father.
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
What if it's your hair?
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
I know, I know, I was unbelievable
Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
Love ... Susan.
Oh, uh, I didn't know.
What are you talking about?
Hey. Where's the car?
Dial 9- MERLIN.
What?
It looks good.
Yeah.
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
Oh! really.
And I said I hadn't seen her.
You were big.
You gotta do me a favor.
(Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
You want it?
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
Yeah.
Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
What?
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
Milk?
Yeah, obviously.
Hi George.
I talked with the groom's parents..
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
Yeah.
No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
How dare you!
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
What if.
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
Two, three hundred?
Uh, great!
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
Bye bye
Okay.
(disappointment) Aww. Sold out.
You're soo good lookin'.
Okay.
All right! I am back in the game.
So, the only reason ...
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
(quiet) Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
What?
Hello. Jerry's not here?
Ring Dings?
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
We're engaged?
What is the problem?
Man, Kramer! I could kill him!
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
Where's Karen?
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
I thought you had done this before.
Yeass.
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
What?
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
A wedding?
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
I think they might be real.
... and biking and ..
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
Well I, I don't know.
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
(listening) A little.
Do you have a...ketchup secret?
Do you hear something?
Mmm, gyro.
But we were here ahead of you.
Did he crumble any crackers in it?
Good morning.
Oh, no.
OK I'll see you later.
You sure you dont mind?
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
What, how did you know that?
Forget it.
(ingratiatingly) They should be here today.
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
Oh! The subway? From Queens?
You told him!!!!
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
Eh, I like mine.
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
did something happened?
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
Hey, when you walk him, do ya...
Hey.
No, no, come on. I guarantee it.
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Malaysia. I was in the area.
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
Congratulations! You passed!
Oh, Mr. Peterman.
3 squares? you can't spare 3 squares??
(Quick) What situation? I have a situation?
Uh, no ... take it.
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
He sat in mud. Not you.
What am I gonna say?
Downtown?
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?
Vincent?
Oh my god, where is it?
You mean lying to your uncle?
Oh, I'm not very good.
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
