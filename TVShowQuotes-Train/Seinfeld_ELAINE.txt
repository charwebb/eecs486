What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
Yeah. Upstairs?
Why? Why were you so embarrassed?
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
Yeah.
What's that?
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
Uh...
What? What do you need a rope for?
(disappointed) Oh.
Oh I didn't tell anyone.
Hey, where's Kramer?
(Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?
I'm not saying anything.
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
Thanks.
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
Or you.
What's that?
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
What?
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
Do you need anything?
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
Oh.
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.
Yeah, I am so sorry.
What was that?
Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
You got any room on that thing?
No. Today's *your* lucky day.
George I don't even want to get --
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
What's wrong?
"I don't care"
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
Do you pick it up?
Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.
No, no, that's okay, it's uh...
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
Green Lantern.
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
What? Why not?
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
I know, but he does.
So what?
(unhappy) I...
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
Bye
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
What do you want!?
No, because I slept with my back to him.
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
What'd I say?
That's just because your a jackass.
I am not your pal.
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
So you say.
We're going out tomorrow night.
Why should you get the first class?
Kramer, is that you?
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
3 squares? you can't spare 3 squares??
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
You want it?
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
(Shrugging it off) Oh, please.
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
Sweater.
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
What woman?
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
No.
I just don't enjoy being with him.
Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?
Hmm.
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
You know karate??
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
Its killing you isn?t it?
What?
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
Oh! my God.
No, what?
Uhh.
What?
Hey!
Jerry, you can barbecue back here.
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
Yeah.
Come on up.
Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
Yeah. Right.
I see.
What are you doing?
It's Elaine Marie Benes.
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
I gotta go return something...
(flirtatious) Hi Jerry.
But she was fifteen.
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
"He's performing at this AMCA benefit."
[gasps]
What tell? What's a tell?
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
There's a feather in your cap.
Cows, well that's fascinating...
No, get-get off my purse!
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
There you are!
Hey, what time is it?
George!
Why don't you just shut the f-
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
all right then, where is it??
So where are we staying?
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
Whoa.
No, that'd be too noisy.
It's BOOKED Jerry!
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
Ill be right back.
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
Ooohh.
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
What're you doing?
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
Aaron? Aaron are you ok?
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
Kissing is not sex.
Yeah.
George?
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
Hm-hmm.
Ah, I know. I know...!
Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...
KRAMER!
So, that's the situation.
Yeah, it's a bra.
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
(To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?
Did you get a haircut?
Help us up so we can cross the street?
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
(embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters.
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
(gesturing) There's this.
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
Well what do you want to give him, change?
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
What is this?
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
Uh, Mr. Pitt...
The Tonight Show?
Hello.
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
Oh, see you tomorrow morning.
Ellis and Alex aren't even close.
"AAaaaaahhh! Really?"(giggles)
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
You asked me to.
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
This car.
"You can't find beauty in a man?"
Ilene.
I like your little bag.
Who?
What guy?
Well...
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
(angrier) Thirteen thousand!
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
All right. Let's do it.
(thrilled) She died?!
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
(downcast) Yeah.
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
No, no, it's okay.
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
What the hell is this? Where are you?
Get out of my way, Jerry.
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
Kicked out?! Why?!
Uh ha.
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
Who's Kristin?
Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
Ah nuts!
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
Wha..wha...?
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
(sitting down in the booth) 'Kay.
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
C'mon
Come in.
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
Of course.
What is wrong with Ned?
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
Yeah.
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
Oh!
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
I didn't pay attention.
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
Are you sure?
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
No, no! They'll stay up!
For this couch?!
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
No. What about him?
COSMO?
And he's dunking!
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
Pocketbook or a handbag?
You didn't know.
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
Oh, God!
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
No.
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
I don't know!
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
What could I be saying?
Yes?
A wedding.
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
You're way off.
Oh, you have to lie.
I know, it's just something you have to say...
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
Hey, it's me.
(pointing) Right here.
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
I'm in looove!
Was it my fault?
Really? Wow.
I'm sorry honey.
What happened, what took you so long?!
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
"Penthouse?"
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
Hey
What do you mean?
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
What, you think I should have?
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
Pardon?
'...singing a song, side by side...'
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
What's his problem?
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
Six hundred and twenty million people died.
Oh, Hi.
Hello!
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.
Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
Oh, probably caught in traffic.
Showering?
Difficult?
Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.
Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember, it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them to fill up the trough.
(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
I'm waiting.
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
Nooo, the other thing.
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
(neutral) Alright.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
No, hes driving back to Maryland tonight.
(upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.
It is funny.
Alright, Im out of here.
C'mon.
What are we gonna do there? Talk?
So? How was it?
Want to go get something to eat?
It's your house.
So did you hear this message?
One million.
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
Make it ten.
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
Okay.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
(looking guiltier) No, nono.
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
With the Chinese woman?!
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
Yes it is
But I wanted to see the bushmen.
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
It is not necessary.
Nowhere.
Kramer, forget it.
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
Who? Who is Ramon?
Well, I couldn't help it. "Moland Spring"?
Bye.
Mm hmm.
Huh.
I wouldn't sign one.
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
Me?
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
Did he get it?
I still smell!
w-What is this all about?
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
What--what did I say?
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
Hi. (They kiss.)
Hey, What are you doing out here?
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
I didn't get it.
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
Later!
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
I don,t think so.
You mean...?
I will.
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
It's a long story.
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
Just go.
Alright, send him up here.
(pause) Well... Can I talk to her?
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
When are you leaving?
You said it was an emergency.
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
(Into the intercom) Yeah?
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
(animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends.
"Join the club."
Whats that?
In about twenty minutes.
Hey.
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
What?
Yes, that's correct.
Jerry!
Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.
Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally.
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
Hey, have you ever fasted?
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
Karate?
Ahem. 646? What is this?
Why?
So what?
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
I can't take your bedroom.
Uh, no, thanks.
A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.
Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
What did he do about it?
Hello
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
Yes I am.
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
(concerned) What? Lloyd is here?
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
Kramer?
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
That's it. That's it. Stop right here.
Well I have to be going.
What's the matter?
So how long did they drag you?
(backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww...
Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?
What kind of shopping?
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
What?
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
Hey! George look at this.
(MUMBLES) That's just about enough
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
You didn't say this to George, did you?
What? What is that?
Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.
eh, Remember Roy, the artist?
Just imports? No exports?
(To George) Stay away from her.
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
He's not THAT religious.
(to Mrs Allister) Janitor's meeting.
Whatever you want.
I guess this one is my fault.
Mmm... phenomenal peas.
You want to work here?
Oh, that sounds... romantic.
(interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry!
Oh! The subway? From Queens?
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
Oh.
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
You're crazy.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
That is so stupid.
Hello.
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
It's Elaine.
You think?
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
I'm okay, it's just a nip.
I really think it's the size of your neck.
It's possible.
This is all very exciting.
I don't know. Chuck it?
Get that out of my face.
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
Yeah, what?
Oh please no more.
Hello? Vincent?
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
What?
Huh.
Really? Grace?
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
Wow, this is soft suede.
(Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?
No, no, it does!
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
Sooo, how was your date?
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
Wow!
Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
something.. wrong?
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
Yeah. Definite moisture.
Oh. No, we're not--
Uh, no. Not really.
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
You're welcome.
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
Oh, I love cashmere.
what about it?
(Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?
Eh, I like mine.
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...
Hey! Wait up!
No.
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
Okay, (to Jerry) Move along. . .
Thank you.
Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
Cosmo, Cosmo?
Really?
(to self in head) This is unbelievable..
Do you?
Do you have an apple or anything?
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
Uh-huh.
Ohh, I got your coffee.
I dunno.
There's no time.
Sorry. Somebody...help us!
Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
Where were you today?
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
Good.
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
Tomato Sauce?
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
What're you getting?
He's not ga-ga.
"Mrs. Onassis's"? That's hard to pronounce.
H-his name?
Oh It must be my new organizer.
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
I have a personal commitment.
Well I figured that's what couples do.
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.
Where are you going?
You know that guy downstairs?
George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
Where's my chart? Did you get it?
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
Oh, Mr. Pitt.
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
What extremities?
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
(To Anna) Get in the car.
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
Why? You don't wear glasses.
It's a page number.
What are you doing here?
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
Id do it but I dont have any money.
I think it's OK.
Bye bye
Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
Awwwwww.
Oh...I don't think so.
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
Why are they doing this?
What meeting?
Was that Tim Whatley?
Then how did you find the place?
My manuscript?
Hello.
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
That is it!
It.
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
Karen?
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
What?
Noooooooooooo!
Really?
Im leaving.
Yeah, like you must procreate.
You feeling jiff?
Seattle.
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
Hey.
(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem.
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
JERRY Cosmo?
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
Yes it is level jumping.
Hey.
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
(Interested) Oh?
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
Did you give him the room number?
Hmmm?
Good.
I don't think so.
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
What?
(seriously worried) Wha...?
What?
Oh my god..
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
Uh, (sob) thanks.
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
Hey!
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
Why?
(raising her hand) Scuse me, master packer...
What is it?
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
Hey.
Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.
Is this gonna hurt?
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
Like ...humm...How did she sound?
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
He didn't mention . . .
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
Milhouse.
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
It's Joe Mayo's coat.
I can't believe you ski!
Hi, Greg.
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
Really.
You got it?
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
Yeah sure.
Where did you get all these pictures?
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
No.
Who is he?
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
(chuckles)
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
Didnt work, huh?
Well I'm going to hell.
Seven-and-a-half.
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
All right and that just about... does it.
No, not at all...
Kramer?
Gone.
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
Even though what?
All right, see you later.
No, wait!
Kramer
Oh, wonderful!
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
What happened?
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
What happened last night?
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
What is the big deal!!
What?
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
Jerry!
I touched 'em.
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
Well, you know what? (removes glasses)
This is it. I can take this anymore.
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
Hey.
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
Mr. Peterman, um--
Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials)
But I, I can't go alone!
What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
Yeah, I'll take it.
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
what?
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
Hey.
Well, nobody *told* me that!
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
(sighing) Again?
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
Kramer, it's...
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
Really?
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
We were just trying to help.
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
Almost.
All shell think is that you like her.
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?
Did you talk about us?
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
Oh, she got hurt.
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
Who is it?
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
Yeah. That's him.
What about the dogs?
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
Uh-huh...
Um, yeah in my purse.
How did you...
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
But, Jake, I didn't...
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
Nervous?
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
Yes.
Twenty sponges should be plenty.
You don't ask.. You tell.
Well.
(urgent) Jerry? Jerry?
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
(firm) No you didn't.
What the hell does that mean?
Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.
Faking what?
Yeah. What, is it a problem?
Yep!
George?
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
Good luck.
Noreen, are you crying?
What?
(sighs) So how about that Aaron?
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
Hey.
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
Oh it's you.
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
(pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
Well, I felt a call for one.
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
No, you can't be trusted!
Hey.
Right
And he's has a bit of a rash.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
What? No good?
(giggling) Ohhh!!.
Mmm, gyro.
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
This is what people do.
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
Mm! To get what?
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
A seemingly infinite supply.
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
Double or nothing.
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
Well, you're not Superman.
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
What for? Let's just get out of here.
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
Oh, dear.
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Wha... W.. Are you going home?
(Between laughs) What is that?!
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
Uh. Does he live underwater?
What's the matter?
I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
yeah.
Oh, I
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
So what do you want me to do?
Rules.
Would you please?
(Finishing it off) ..done that.
Whoa! Whoa!
Well ...
Ah, this really sticks in my craw.
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
After one date!
Come on tell me what happened.
Sauce me.
What are you gonna do down there?
What? Wheren't they just here?
(sighs) So 10 to 14 months.
Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
Yeah.
Saturday.
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
What happened? What took you so long?
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
Yeah, she's a package full of something.
Ohh...
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
(not sure) I guess.
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
(Between chuckles) How is she?
Nothing, nothing.
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
Thank you. Ow!
(sees racquet) Could I ...
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.
Im not so sure he wants one.
(Embarrassed) Free sub.
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
I got a pebble.
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
No, don't...
Are you okay?
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
Why?
Oh that's a nice store.
(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
(Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite.
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
Really? Can you really take a picture?
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
What was that all about?
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
Aaalright!
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
Hi,
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
No, no.
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
How did you do that?
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
Why?
I *loooove* horse manure.
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
What? Who told you that?
It works.
Really!?
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
Hi, Susan.
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Over you?
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
I don't know.
Chilly out.
You still couldn't kiss her?
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
Ah, what're you doing here?
You.
His place...
(indifferent) Yuh.
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
Ever.
Uh uh
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
They don't know anybody in Chicago.
Mmm!
(weary) Jerry!
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)
You want the money for the big salad, George?
Oh please.. It's in the vault.
What? What happened?
What's wrong with your shower?
George, I cannot believe...
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
Oh god.
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
Listen to me you little shi........
He can really do that?
Eh.
Theres no Rubber Man.
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
Hi!
Delish. You know, short for delicious.
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
Ugh!
It smells like a rubber fire.
I know.
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
I never saw the statue.
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
Boogey?
Mm, love Farbman.
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
Jerry, talk to that guy again.
Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
(gasps)
I thought my idea was just as good.
Aren't you?
So you're giving him a discount too?
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
So you don't know anything?
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
Right.
Was it blue?
I staked out his health club.
Hey. What's this.?.
Oh Kramer. (They embrace)
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
Someone I know.
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
Yeah
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
Uh.. I?m Elaine!
Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
I told you, I can't hear a word.
I'm sure they're not.
So.
Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
All right. Spill it, Jerome.
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
Why cant you sit in the middle?
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
Did you do with the dogs?
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
(neutral) Okay.
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
We didn't come in over there!
Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.
What do you think?
Hi Tina.
Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
Ha ha ha ha.
What's the name of this physical therapist?
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
Who?
What did you do?
Oh...
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
Good morning, Jackie.
Vincent?
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
Noooo.
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
Good night
Oh really?
Well what happened when you raced him again?
Why couldn't he be a dunker?
You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
Because it's insane?
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
What else have you got?
Answering machine.
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
What?
Yeah.
Jerry, She looks exactly like you.
What's going on?
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
AH! I've got it.
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
(Accepting) Alright.
What!?
Dial 9- MERLIN.
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
What...?
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
Aha hu, You look *terrific*.
It's nothing.
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
Oh.
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
How ya doin'?
Why is that beautiful?
Find out what's going on!
I am speechless. I am without speech.
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
Bob!
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
How much did he save?
Well, that'll get you goin' right there...
What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
"Elaine got a new dress."
I've got a confession to make.
What time you got?
Hmm.
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
I am up for anything.
Some ugly baby, huh?
So this is never gonna stop?
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Hellllllooooo.
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
Yeah.
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
Help him move? Move what?
My, my father?
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
What pool guy?
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
No.
here, take it
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)
Jerry!
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
Mm-hmm.
(grudging) Alright.
Come on, father, you can make it.
(Shrugging) I thought all guys do that.
Oh.
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
Faster.
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
Ok, so now what?
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
Pal? You think I'm your pal?
We know what a face consists of.
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
(shouts) HEY!!
George!
Well, that's...that's sweet.
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
All right. I'm going I'm going
Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
Right.
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.
No, I guess you couldn't have..
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
Wow.
. . . What does that mean?
What did you do that for?
All right. Witness? (looks at George).
What?
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
She did? Oh, that's so great!
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
What? What?...
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
. . . no.
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
Yeah, how about her?
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Oh, Kramer.
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
George, you got a little something, right here.
Why? What happened?
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
See, yeah, that's all I was saying.
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
Yeah, especially those frames.
Exactly.
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
10th
That's a pretty girl.
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
You never know...
He has good days and bad.
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
He's got it.
Yeah, Yeah!!
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
Start smoking.
Maybe we could all have dinner later?
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
Absolutely.
Why dont you just ask her parents?
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
In the office.
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
Is he happy?
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
Kramer, what's wrong?
This was my idea you stole my idea.
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
(laughs) Yeah, right, youre the master packer.
You think it's effeminate?
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
Yeah, pretty much.
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
My pleasure.
(Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.
Yeah, Kramer, come on in.
So how did this happen?
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
He's on with a Chinese woman.
He has to go. He may have killed her.
I said, All Right.
No idea.
No, still Sharon!
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
Yea.
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...
Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
"What are you gettin'?"
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
Oh, hi Greg.
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
Get out!
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
Devastating.
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
"Ughhhh"
No.
Uh
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
Since when?
No!
What d'you mean?
What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.
Um...as far as I know.
Who wouldn't taste a pie?
I said I'll take care of it!
a ply?
Yeah, they flip a coin.
What the hey.
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
He seems to be breathing.
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
No no, no no.
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
What about George?
Ooooh, please.
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
What is it?
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
Hi.
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
. . . shut up! (?)
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
You got that right.
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
I'm sure you could.
Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning)
I can't believe you left your post.
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
A fake number! Blimey!
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
You want one?
Can it cut that thin?
I just met him this morning.
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
Are you out of your mind?!
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
So what're you gonna do?
I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
Right! In fact... No, never mind...
Can you let go of my tongue now?
Now what was that?
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
What?
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
You would do that?
Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
That, had to be invented?
Uh huh...
Ahh-cnee.
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?
Ah hahaha hhuu ha (flirty laughing)
Its that bad?
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
Jerry no, that's important to me.
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
Drake gave her the TV?
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
Ahhhhhh haa ha ha
Did anyone call?
All right! I am back in the game.
Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer!
This, that, and the other.
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
How did you know?
I Like Her!
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
Hey!
I know.
Ah Oh!!
"Well.... (pointing at him) Jimmy!"
Uhmmm huh! Is it important.?
No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
What, how did you know that?
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
That's a rat hat?
What? What sweater?
(annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing)
No, it's from the store.
Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
You didn't bring a brown sweater.
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
I wish I was dead.
Jerry?
Kramer!
What do you do?
I dont think so David, were through.
I know, he's so tiny!
Very nice meeting you!
Oh! boy.
Well I didn't know.
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
Call an ambulance.
Oh, you'll be playing ...
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
They rehearse all the time?
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
Oh. How much you got left?
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
Oh, hi, Frank.
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
What are you doing?
Enchante.
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
Yes, he is dumb.
(quietly) No, no, no, I can cancel.
Whar about Kramer?
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
Why?
Peter Jennings had one?
You heard me. Strip!
Oh my god.
uh?
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
Yeah.
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
I got what you asked.
So you cant do both?
What?
Uhh, so frustrating!
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
Hi!
Vivian...
So you're concerned.
Hi.
I'm sorry, George, but it's true.
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
Relax--
We're down here! Help!
And then you flush.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
How can I do that?
Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
This.
Oh. Ok. Thank you.
Hey Kramer, Kramer!
Great. You?
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
I know.
I hear ya, Sister.
Don't worry. We won't forget!
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
Are you
So, George... did you get the chair?
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
So he was bad. What d'you care?
What about a bad gasket?
What?
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
yeah, yeah
Uhhh...
Really? What is it about?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
Wow...
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
Okay... bathroom....kitchen.
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
Yeah, alright, I gotta go.
Yeah.
It's brug-wa (?).
Hey, what do you think?
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
The New Yorker has poetry.
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
(to Kramer) He took it out.
Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.
No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
(nods) HumHummmm....
What kind of maniac is this guy?
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
You're giving him *ten* dollars?
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
Fine. (laughs)
Hi.
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
My leg looks pretty bad.
(reading) At the Knights of Columbus?
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
Good! I won't!
yeah
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
(like a little girl) Okay...
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
Nice to meet you.
What would you wear?
Well, she has it!
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
He's waving..
(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
Uh, Kramer...
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.
Yeah.
Well maybe you should ask him!
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
Yeah.
I just said the same thing to you.
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
Malaysia?
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
Ah.
I know!
Oh, that creepy guy?
Out.
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
Hi!
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
Since when is a drain a toilet?!
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
Yes! 915!
I thought you wore silk underwear.
Uh... (clears her throat) Rifkin.
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
Right, I think its this
Why? Why d'you think he's upset?
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
No thanks.
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
yeah ha ha ha
What?
Are you doing new material?
Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
Yeah, I'm on the phone here.
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
(Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green.
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
No!
But you didn't say anything. Ohhh
You're not going to do any walking.
Huh!
Yeah.
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
(listening) A little.
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
Yeah! It's a social thing.
That's it?
You don't have any furniture?
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
Better call the zoo.
Hey!
Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
Um, no.
What happened?
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)
(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Thanks
I gotta go talk to him.
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
Shove it!
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
What did who say?
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
Kramer, the vest just called.
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
Did you see that?!
It's PLO blend.
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
It's Vegetable Lasagna.
Oh!
It's possible.
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
No, Alec Berg.
Oh, yeah.
I'll catch it!
Wha- a picture?
Absurd!
(softly to Dick) Dick.
(shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God.
Yes, she's very upset.
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
(from a distance) Hey.
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
George I was just kidding around.
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
No Mister Peterman.
So, what did you say?
I don't like to talk during a massage.
Bark.
Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
Oh come on.
Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.
Oh, he went insane?...
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
Get out!
Oh, hi honey.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Why?
Yes, he is lazy.
Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
We can't ask him...
Uhh, I don't think so.
It's a beautiful couch.
Ready.
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
You know...*the* move.
(gets Kramer's point) Hah.
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
NO.
No.
THIS is what you came up with?
Oh, okay, go ahead.
There he is.
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
What's... medium?
You could have.
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
You gotta do me a favor.
(gasps) How did you find it?
Sorry. Hello?
I've lost 6 pounds.
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
Nothing.
What did she say?
yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
Okay.
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
Hello.
Yes, yes Mr. Mandel.
Who's Sally?
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
How kind of you.
Mm-hmm.
So they don't want a baby?
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
Oh, I know! It is awful!
(looks at it) TV Guide?
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
huh, Mine's 145.
Ya, Yes we will!
You got something on your mind?
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
Hey, "great" organizer you gave me.
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
(quietly) What?
But I didn't do anything.
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
Uh, it was in the Hamptons.
Oh, my god.
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
I think he does too
Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
[momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small?
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
So what?
Did you tell him it was peed on?
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
I don't think we should be talking about this.
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
Having a good time!
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
Correct.
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
Just get the car!
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
Hey George
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
Hey. Hey everybody.
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
So when are we gonna eat?
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
[gasps]
Soup's not all that good anyway.
You're not taking me back?
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
You smoke?
Well, that is, that is strange.
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
(awed) Oh, look at this!
I know! Can you imagine that?
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
Come in, come in!
You sure you don't need any help?
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
What?
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
Oh Tomorrow...?
What?, uh?
Why should I tell you?
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
All I've got is grape juice.
Well I have to interview a Mohel.
What is the matter?
Well then what?
Hello. (she enters)
All right, ha ha
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.
(angry shout) Kramer!
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
What, you never said it?
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
Yay!
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
Well, what do you want me to do?
As long as you don't put...
Ooh, it's a cake walk.
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
Things occur to me from time to time.
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
Thank you. (gets up from her seat)
What are you doing in here with that?
What's your Problem?
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
What call?
Yeah.
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
Hey.
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
Not so good.
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
I think they might be real.
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
(Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
Oh, sure.
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
Mrs. Winston?
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
Yes, Mr. Pitt?
Hey, Jean-Paul.
He's not my boyfriend.
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
Well, it's for my boss.
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
Ellis.
Really. Why?
Well, I don't know about "gold."
The one you broke the plans with tonight?
Bye.
What?
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
Why?
Right after ... that ...
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
Yep.
Boys are sick.
Yeah.
Oh.
OKAY!!!
(shouts) Oh, go to hell!!
Uh, aw, KL5-239O.
You went...in the shower?
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
You know Sue Ellen Mishke?
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
think Tony, think
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
No not quite.
(admiring gasp) Fabulous.
No. A general guy.
Wow. You really have a terrible voice.
Well, either way
(dismayed) Ah, all o'--all of us?
Oh, no, it's okay.
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
Who else is on the show?
I was just kiddin, around.......
You're gonna pick up the pieces.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?
Alright. Forget it!
(dumbfounded) No.
It was an accident!
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
No they don't.
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
Did you try the cigarettes?
Oh my God. You're crying.
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
How long does a funeral take?
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
I think they look good!
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
So, I understand youre moving to Phoenix?
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
Hiiii Kramer
Do you think of anything?..
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
(worried) What? What?
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
Really, what was the first?
I don't think so.
Well at least let George do it!
(stretching) Oh Man... Uunh.
Oh my God.
You don't have an old pair?
No way!
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
Well, I'll see ya... (exits)
Hi
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
Tell Ping I said hello.
(shouts) I hate it!!
Which one is he?
What, you don't think she's beautiful?
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
What butcher?
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
So, you weren't born here?
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!
Well, can I introduce you as doctor?
Really? What're the other titles?
Oh, god! Let us out!
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?
Oh, well I have to eat.
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
Maybe I should just get married.
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
Where's Karen?
Dave, um, painted his face.
Yes.
You're going to the Tony's too?
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
What did he do?
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
Yeah, right.
What is this?
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
So?
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
You going to do something about your sideburns?
"Why?"
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
I don't want to see her naked.
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
hi, nice to meet you finally
My most, just heartfelt congratulations.
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
Oh, yeah.
"Elaine, ya gotta have a baby." Ugh.
Yeah, exactly, the "triangle" guy.
There is no park and the team has relocated.
did something happened?
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
I think I might.
He was laughing?!
Well...Poppie. I think differently.
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?
Somethings going on here.
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
You have no choice.
It's right over there.
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
What air conditioner?
Are you serious?
Yeah.
(rolling her eyes) Lithe!
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine.
Hello?
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
Everybody does. Bye-bye....
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
So I'm not gonna be an usher?
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
That was two months ago.
What guy?
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
I don't know.
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
Yeah, that's right.
What?
Why Japan?
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
You don't need us.
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
O, your being auditted? What for?
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
No.
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
"Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's."
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
So, what did he do?
The pygmy pullover.
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
Where's Beth?
Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!
[heavy sarcasm] Oh. Thanks.
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
yes, (sob) I suppose,
Of course I hear that.
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
I don't know, I guess.
Oh, that's not too expensive.
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
I beg to differ.
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
Malaysia. I was in the area.
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
Hey Boys-O!
Three notes?
George, please.
So, whatd she say?
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.
No! Jerry! Jerry!
hey
Bye Eeeen.
For nothing..
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
How's he gonna chew it?
(LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.
How dare you!
You're father was blacklisted?
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
Puddy, don't wait for me.
Oh! Where are you going?
Yeah.
Throw down your key.
Call Kramer.
Oh. So, you're pretty religious?
How much did you pay for them?
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
What is that?
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
AHhh. Thank you.
(neutral) Fine.
What is that?
I don't know, maybe.
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
Wow. Youre right. That is loud.
What?!
Wow! What a story.
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
Good working with you.
Yeah.
Yes! I'm a writer.
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
I dont have five thousand dollars.
[To Jerry] What about you?
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
That's what I said.
We know the terrain.
Hi E-an
Uh, uh.
Right.
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
You're gonna wear this all the time?
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
Really?
Shut up!
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
What's all this?
What's to discuss?
Oh, you come on.
(Flattered) Mr. Pitt...
We're not wilding.
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
What is a wig master?
Do I know him?
(English accent) Pardon?
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
Uh,
I'm sorry.
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
Then how did she find out, Jerry?!
Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.
Jerry? Jerry!
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
Oh.
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
What? No, its not a big deal.
What was that look?
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
Well, thank you father.
Ohhhhh, that's great.
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
Well, uh, fan. My father--
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
(laughs)
What? Was it something I said?
Can I get you anything?
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
No, thats a big coincidence.
And scuba diving.
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
I don't know. It's a building.
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
Thank-you.
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
What?
Ninety-five hundred.
Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.
No.
Oh, how's the baby?
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
He went back.
... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)
I said rubber fire.
Him? Him who?
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
Then why did you print it.
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
Yup. You?
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
Oh...(falls in to the sofa.)
(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
What's me?
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
Oh, hi.
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
Yeah, but we have a common goal.
50
What is this?
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
But we were here ahead of you.
Oh, bye. Good to see you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
Hey George.
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
Kramer.
How do you know?
Oh great, thanks Kramer.
What smell?
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
These are terrible.
Oh!
Hi!
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
What, the one who just left?
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
Ten minutes.
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
Wait, what about your vomit streak?
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
Thought it would be nice.
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
(whispering to George) You're up.
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
Isn't that a little...rash?
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Forget it. You are very careful with money.
He's guarding a suit?
No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
Oh no, thank you.
Really?
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
What, are you into this?
This cantaloupe stinks.
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
(grabbing Puddy) What are you doing?
Kramer.
They drove away?
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
[exasperated] What is it made of?
I have to eat!
Hello.
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
Yeah. It is.
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
Yeah.
Oh, no. Don't!
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)
I dunno.
"How so?"
Yeah, Im gonna work on that
Hey.
because of the gum
Ah, I didn't know who he was!
Excuse me...
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
Joe DiMaggio?
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
Well, you can't walk around like that.
It's a new area code.
It's ironic.
Good for you.
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
Are you sure?
Oh, me too.
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
Wa',you don't have the directions?
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
"Ahum!"
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
Colors.
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
Certainly not.
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
What?
(Shocked) Stabbed?!
Jerry?
You pick it up?!?
What? How?
Dump her.
What kind of soup did he get?
No, really.
Ah, look who's here. "Silicon Valley."
Whoa. What is the matter?
I'm sorry... sorry.
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
Do you realize what youre saying?
Well, at least you're not bitter.
Hmm! Rico!
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
no no , ..
Hi.
I said it.
Okay, so fine. Go.
Rarely.
What?
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
Well, um, he, he got fired.
(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
What were your.. demands?
Really?
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
What? Why?
Ugh! You are kidding me.
Oh, fantastic.
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
Me?
You get out of here!
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
You know, we should say something.
You think?
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.
And you feel you're not really ready for,
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
Judy .
We have to replace the couch.
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
Well, go, go.
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
I thought he was Kramer's friend.
Ya
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
No, he wants to torture me.
Balloon bouquet? For who?
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
Huuh, Wow.
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
You been enjoying them?
Hi.
(meek) Yes ma'am.
Oh, hi Noel
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
(frustration) Ugh!
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
(scoffs) Uh, is Noreen there?
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
I am never gonna fall asleep.
Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
Get out of here! Why?
How's that gonna happen?
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
You went to see her?
Um. Kramer!
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?
Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?
Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose)
Hello.
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
Yeah.
Oh-kay. Gimme the large.
Is she?
I'm going down there.
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
Great!
How do you feel?
(whispers) Poor bastard.
Pardon me?
Mr. Peterman, I, uh...
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
You think we're far enough.
(laughs)
No, I'm watching my weight.
I can be very clever.
What?
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
Because we're adults?
Hello, Tim.
Hey.
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
Just read it!
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
(Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.
You're telling me.
They were stolen.
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
He schnapped me.
All right, sir.
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
Jerry.
Ninety-nine percent sure?!
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
Yeah, it's all taken care of.
You haven't told him?
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
You are amazing.
Yeah, I'd like to place an order.
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) Mm-hm.
Is that the right word?
Sara Sitarides?
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
(pointedly) Okay. Fine.
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
Why do I keep setting you up?
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
What?!
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
So was Mia Farrow there?
A Ziggy?
I guess.
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
I know, it's not that.
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
And the bush-women.
The balance beam?
Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
Really?
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
You have no idea?
He's got a back problem.
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
Uuuhm, all the time.
Were you just talking about me?
What? Why not?
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
Oh.
Did you find the place alright?
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
They don't get that much.
This is his home?
Robin? No, why?
So it wasn't a bomb.
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
That's what I'm saying.
What do you charge for blown shocks?
On occasion.
Newman plays tennis?
Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
You have a little thing for this fella'?
Man, Kramer! I could kill him!
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
Yeah. (startled)
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
I guess I'm... Lois Loan.
Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
Yeah, who speaks Korean?
Leo. Has the doctor been in yet?
You want to bet?
You can.
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
What, is that a rule?
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
Really?
No. I can't smell it.
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
Nooo.
I can't. I'm the best man.
I'm going to order Chinese Food.
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
Uh hu.
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
No. In what way?
Ohh, what is the point?
Swan Lake, at the Met.
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
(worry) Oh no. What?
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
Both of the them.
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
There, we just talked business.
Softer.
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
Hello, darling.
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
What?
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
Yeah, I know.
Jerry, give him the keys back.
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
I can't go.
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
We did. We're just hanging out.
Hi, (sighs) you got the organizer?
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
You know, Kenny Rogers has a-
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
No?
All right, we're done here.
You were snooping.
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
Mmm, nice to meet you.
What, are you in a bad mood?
Elaine.
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
Yes.
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
Yeah, right.
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
Okay.
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
You're eye still hurts?
(very reluctant) Okay.
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
No, no no.
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
Well, he looks like a man.
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
Seriously, we don't.
I have to live in a cave.
I don't know.
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
Let me think about it.
Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
Listen, was Russell at the casting?
What's the status?
Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!
That's good...
What?
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?
George! It's cheating.
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
Oh, see, this is the problem.
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
Yeah, she was an editor.
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
What? JERRY Where's the car?
I'll pay for it.
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
It felt like a couple of levels.
I'd stick.
Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!
I say, it's a peach.
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
I told ya'. He has ideas.
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
Oh. Oh God.
So, how did it end?
Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
Alright.
Isn't that a little racist?
No, I can't.
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
G'night, Jugdish. (Laughs)
What did I do?
Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me.
Oh, right.
Where did you get her?
Then how come we're not moving?
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
What if.
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
Uh... I...
I'll have a cinnamon babka.
Jerry Seinfeld.
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
Yes indeed.
Uhm, I just have a question.
(big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
So, guess who called me.
Hey. What's going on?
South Africa.
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.
I cant remember.
(warning) George.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
Jerry!
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
Of what?
Hi George. Hi Jimmy.
Maybe.. All over your face!
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
(gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
My Puddy? But we broke up.
yeah.
Some friend of his from England.
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
Oh, well, (pauses) Good night.
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
Excuse me?
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
No.
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
Well, no, I would hardly--
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
Yeah, we're good friends.
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
Are you sure you want us here for this?
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
No no no no, it's just...
How much is this?
Great, great.
And Ill be right upstairs?
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
Yeah.
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
I've got Super Bowl fever.
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
Can I fix that after lunch sir?
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
You never said you were fighting children.
(off-camera) It's Lainey!
How many?
They want five thousand dollars now.
(points) I like Witchy Woman.
How bout a Big Salad?
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
Hey, did you make the movie?
Do you see it or don't you?
Hi.
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
(Leaving) That's fantastic.
(shocked) What?
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
You don't know?
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
Really? When?
Oh god, Who's suitcase is this?
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
yeah me too
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
You should show this to Georgie.
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
(dismissive) Gene's trash.
Hey Todd.
Oh. (Leaves for the room)
Katra?
How can I go?
Aww.
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?
So, thats why were not together anymore.
Who is he?
Kramer, this is too big.
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
Well come here and take a look.
Yeah!
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
Well how about a carrot cake?
Yes. He's one of those bounders.
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
What about his comedy act?
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
I know.
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
He told you about . . .
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
What?
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
*Get* *out*!
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
Stop _ the _ fight!
The flight's been canceled?!?!
Hello?
I think she'd figure it out.
Make it three hundred.
The look you just gave me.
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
You sure you don't mind?
Should I do it, George?
Pffft....there's really nothing to do.
Consomm, hmm.
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
Yeah.
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
Yes, I would say.
Not, my Tim Whatley?
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
What?
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
Oh, uh, I didn't know.
I will never understand people.
Forty-seven.
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
What did you think, that would impress me?
(mouths silently) Okay.
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
No, we just met...
Yeah.
Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
No, I talked him into it.
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
Huh?
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
They have a big salad.
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
Plan B? There is no plan B.
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
About three years.
(to George) Hey.
So we can go anywhere we want?
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
Uh,
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
Fine.
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
laughing awkwardly Oh. Right. Good one.
Tuna?
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
I've never seen you jealous before.
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
Hello?
Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
No, I don't want the man either.
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
So tell me more about this game SIX.
Get movin'...
Yeah. It's surprising.
What was that again?
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
Just gimme twenty bucks.
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
No.
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
So go buy a new one.
George I wasnt serious.
Remember that Columbus book?
What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
Yeah.
Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.)
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
Why?
What is this symbol?
Ow, ow move over.
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
(extemporising) Uh... chips.
Deal with it. Be a man!
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
Noreen, were you hitting on him?
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
It's dancing.
I can't tell you.
You gotta follow that car!
Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
I am?
So then what?
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
What are you doing with this couch?
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
Yeah it is nice actually.
Artie Shaw. "Honeysuckle Jump." (The song ends.)
Hi Julie.
Where'd you get this?
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
What? What is this?
Yes.
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
Oh, hi, Dad.
Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH)
(Let down) He didn't show.
I'm sure he was just joking around.
No!
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
Well I, I don't know.
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
Really?
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
Yeah Jerry.
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
(surprised) Brett? Everything alright?
OK I'll see you later.
Why not?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
(Blunt, to the point) No.
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
What's that?
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
Oh, what is this?
Yeah.
It's invisible.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
Hey!
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
Like clams.
Did you see that?
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
Will you just park it already?
It must be a mistake.
What IQ test?
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!
Why?
I'll bet they were even in on it.
I got a note from my gynecologist.
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
What?
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
Here.
What's wrong with him?
Cocktail flu.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
O.K. O.K. Remy.
Desperado.
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
Oh, no.
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
Look at you. You're on a slant.
Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
Ill eat out.
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
uhn... Sorry!
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
Kramer, what are you doing here?
Do you have twenty bucks?
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
Yeah, I called him Maestro.
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
What about the couch?
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
You punched who in the mouth?
No that's the week after.
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
What?
Yeah, the jewel thief.
Oh, I'm not, uh...
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
Yeah.
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
You what?
Yeah, it got pretty nasty.
HI
You got me an apartment in the building?!
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
She's Cynthia!
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
Do, do you?
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
Nope.
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
What?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
Jer, do you see where this is going?
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
Ah, Susan uses the sponge.
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)
(pushes him) You doofus!
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
No, it could get sexual.
What?!
Kitzmiller.
No, I'm not. Here you go.
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
You don't know?
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
(laughing) No thanks.
What's `medium'?
Hey!
A LeBaron?
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
Where's my drink?
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
I hate the counter.
It's not serious, is it?
Well.
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
What? You're Cheryl Fong?
Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
What are you doing? What is that?
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
Oh...well...
Bye-bye.
You got that right.
Forty bucks? Are they Sable?
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
Keep following him.
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
Yup, you mean him?
Why is that?
It's me!
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
I might be Elaine.
Nothing, and I've looked.
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
(quiet) Look at this turnout.
Hey, what do you think of this?
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
Really cold.
Sssshhhhhh!!!
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
Shhhhhh. Here.
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!
Right!!
(quietly) Ahhhhh
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
Well, how could he do that?
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
Right on baby. (???)
You sure you dont mind?
No, there are degrees of coincidences.
I know.
Oh, boy, I'm really scared!
Hey.
Ah, you don't have to tell me.
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
Not getting along?
Where's Lois?
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Hey, I did it.
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
Oh. Are you alright?
(dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him.
Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
(intercom) it?s me!
Jerry, do I stink?
Hi....???
Oh, sure.
Oh, thanks. I've got plans.
Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...
What are you saying?
Babs?
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
I won't.
Um, well what's the difference?
Boy, he takes such a long time.
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
Why is she doing this?
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend Paul.
I don't know if I can.
(Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!
(ingratiatingly) They should be here today.
Bore-ing.
What?
Sheets.
Mr Lippman?
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
Hi!
Hey what's that?
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
Maybe.
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
Uhm...
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
I dunno, at least three weeks.
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
Diapers.
(impatient) Get out!
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
(pause) What do you mean?
That's because I thought you were black.
Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
Yeah, yeah.
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
Goodbye?
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
Well stop being such a baby.
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
Oh
I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
I'm not surprised.
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
you know (acts like a monster)
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff.
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
Why can't he play for us?
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
When do you take this exam?
"Able Mentally Challenged Adults"
What happened?
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
Yes, it's a must lie situation.
Oh, all right.
Dick was fired.
I am an associate.
Uh huh.
Hi, Gail.
Yeah...
(big smile) Okay.
Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?
Hi!
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
Of course Id pay you back..
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
How ya feeling?
Hi, Mr. Lippman.
I'm sorry but there's somebody else.
'Cos I'm not in the mood.
No one.
Ring Dings?
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
Oh, gimme a break!
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
She died!
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
You found a hair in your Farina?
So what did he have to say?
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
[laughing]
It's not bleak - it's springtime.
this isn't a very good time George
"I know that but why are you going?"
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
It's not a purse. It's European.
Oh my god.
Yeah.
The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
Ugghh.
(exhales)
(Agreeing) Mm.
(quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it?
You do?
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
(SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?
Yeah, so they say.
He did.
What?!
Yeah.
Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?
Did he give you a reason?
Who is that?
What is wrong with everybody?
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
What could happen?
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine)
(annoyed) Aww, nuts!
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
I really like the city.
No. Stay! Stay. Stay.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
Get out!
What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
Just hold on!
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
Kramer?
unbridled enthusiasm...?
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
You can't beat a babka.
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
What's it?
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
Me? Why me?
Excuse me?
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
Jerry, ... He's a GUY!
Well, he's not a baseball player.
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
Anything else?
(raises her hand) Yo.
Ah, this. And that.
Why don't I give you my phone number?
Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry.
That was so good.
Binaca?
You still got that Fedex?
What?
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
Oh, man. We're stopping?
She's not Chinese?
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
You mean in a real Fight Fight?
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
You never get good haircuts.
Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
No, I need it.
Bye.
(feeling sick) Yeah! go ahead.
No.
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
I talked with the groom's parents..
Me either.
You can pick 'em up right now.
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
(resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine.
Why do you keep watching?
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
No, that's not your coat.
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
They make it longer?
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
Oh my god.
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
I like coffee.
I turned him. He defected.
We never dated in winter.
Aaron
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
(Obviously not impressed, dull) Yeah, real nice.
What's that?
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
First the sucking then the weaning.
Who's that?
(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...
(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
I guess it's you, Jer.
Why? What happened? Did you talk?
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
Better, now.
David
Open your vault.
She.
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
Oh, gorgeous, yes.
Yeah.
(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
"I do now."
(To Jerry) You tell him.
He did.
Come on!
You just left? What did you tell her?
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
Oh, my God... The Mohatma?
No, No...
Good. Good. You?
What did he do?
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
Uhmm...
Whhhy?
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
Shut up...
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
Oh, the date. The date.
No. She died.
How can you even consider not going?
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
Pardon?
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
A bubble?
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?
So now Duncan is back?
I think I can tell.
Ohhh! Golden Boy?
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
No, I really don't want to.
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
This is an absolute disaster.
No, no, unfocus.
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
Kramer, what's the matter with you?
What?
We should be able to get across right through here!
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
You're talking too much!
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
Why?
Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
You get yours out, I was here first!
No. Me neither.
Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.
Why does it shrink?
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
See what is that? Is that a date?
What?
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
Jerry?
Bye.
Wha'd you come in here for?
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
You ready?
Do adults ever order the child-size?
I think they went out to dinner.
You want it?
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
Yes.
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
I have no idea.
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
That sounds urgent...
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
Oh, gimme a break..
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
What's going on?
I don't want it.
I don't know.
[gives up] Yeah, exactly...
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
Well, you know. It's a picture?
Just me and George alone?
Would you change yours?
I dunno.
Yeah.
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
Yeah. You're right.
I'm not below.
What?
and here.
Thanks for the re-fill.
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
Yeah.
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
It's me.
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
Love ... Susan.
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
We talked about that already.
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
Oh...
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
(Mocking) Yeah, I'll chew on that.
I'm marchin'. (Enter George)
My father, really? I had no idea.
Really? You really think I should fire her?
Hi!.
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
Yeah, there is, right here you see--
Yeah.
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
Donna Chang?
Oh.
Hey.
Who wants cupcake?
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
Hey. Oh, is that a label maker?
What do you mean?
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
(right away) No. Second choice.
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
Hi.
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
Oh, take 'em.
Can he do that?
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
I think it's a mistake.
(gasp)
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
Hi.
A pleasure.
Steve.
What?
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
(Concerned) What's the matter?
Why?
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
So what happened?
(on intercom) It's Elaine.
Mm-hm.
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
He dared....
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
Makes you wonder, though, doesnt it?
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
New couch? Why?
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
"your shirt was out?"
No, but... it is very nice to know.
Ah, I'm ready what?
But it's cold out.
Uh, it's a riot Alice.
Nope.
No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
What?
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
What?
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
What happened to Bob Saccamano?
(Between laughs) Jugdish.
I'm sure it's right around here.
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
Yeah, me too.
But I really did like it
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
What's so funny
They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic)
I thought you were finished.
HUH, so should you.
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
It is..
I knew those condoms were defective!
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
Hi boys.
Yeah.
Well I don't care. It was delicious.
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
No.
No, he's just neat.
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
What?
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
Hey.
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
Ah! Orgasm?
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
Oh, that's fantastic.
Oh she's fat?
Oh, I know the type.
Well, I --
... me to go.
Well maybe I feel the same way.
What?
Well what, what about your fact-checking job?
No, I'm sure you do.
Hello
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
Oh, no...that won't last.
Why don't you just go see Jerry?
Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
Well, come on we're on vacation.
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
Okay...Good day..
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
Is he black?
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
No.
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
Aren't you too young to be bitter?
Oh, great. Send him in.
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
She...likes you..
Oh, go down and get them.
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
I needed to move a bureau.
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
I dropped a grape.
Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
What?
Thanks
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
Wow!
Oh, come on.
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
So what are their plans?
Ah, right there, yeah.
"Hey Jimmy!!"
Who is it?
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
All right.
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
It's supposed to feel good.
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
Hide!
What are you, yellow?
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
No, I don't want this anymore.
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
Cookies?
Jerry!
I'm gonna faint...
You're all grown up.
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
What?
You know, George, that's an onion.
If only.
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
I've never seen her before.
Mm-Hmm.
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
Hey, what if he's married?
Uh, that's, ...
Ugh, the hell with 'em.
It's the play button, off his VCR.
(pointing at the shoes) "What are those?"
You have no idea.
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
Okay.
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
(sniffing) Dandruff?
Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt.
When was this?
Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
(looking up to the salesman)
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
Are you calling me a liar?
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
It's not just hair! Look!
Yea, I guess that could work.
Casus belli.
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
Hey.
Come on. Let me see it.
a square?
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
What?
Dana Folley.
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
Alright, let's go, come on.
No.
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
I cut it.
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?
Yeah. What do you do all day?
Oh yeah? How'd you do?
What?
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
How close do you get?
Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Hem!! No reason.
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
what?
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
Uh-huh.
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
It's disgusting.
Well, uh, I'll cancel it.
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
Yep.
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
What?
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
Yeah!
How could you say something like that?!
Oh, congratulations
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
(confused) Jimmy legs?
I wonder what happened?
What? What is with all these books?
Oh hi, Sue Ellen.
Hi (?). Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know, uh...they're fake.
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
Well, did he say that?
I thought George was meeting us here?
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
Cheryl Miller's brother?
I heard him contend that.
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
What?
It's us.
Do you have a...ketchup secret?
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
I'm good.
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
You know the Three Tenors?
Ahh ... wait till you hear this.
Mr. Peterman?
Now those look good, they're very bold.
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
Nice to see..
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
It.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
Is that something?
It isn't?
Look out the window, you'll see.
Whatever.
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
How?
"Oh yeah! Jimmy."
We certainly have.
Did you read the whole thing?
Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters.
I think so.
Yeah. (sits down next to Susan)
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
I'm not being superficial
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
Can you believe him?
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
Hey, working out?
(shouting up) Jerry! Jerry!
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...
It's me.
(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces
Right.
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
Uh, does it matter if it's melted?
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
Yes.
Still a 31 waist?
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
(to another passenger) Huh. You believing this?
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
Hey, I didn't even use one.
Congratulations.
Ah hah.
Alright, there's no---
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
Ow! Careful, it's hot.
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
...so much. You're so damn...sexy.
I don't have a fax machine.
You're eating my food!
Huh . So What's it about?
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
What did he have to say?
Nelson.
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
Yeah, right.
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
Yeah, obviously.
Hey, how's your hair?
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
Don't say that!
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
Why does he do that?
Ohh!
There's Rachel.
It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
Jerry.
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
Well, no point in wasting $1,200.
Yeah. That's what I just said.
I'm not mad.
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
No....Oh No....
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
(accepting) Okay, okay.
What?
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
When did you tell George to be here?
Jerry?
The dingo ate your baby!
What about Switzerland?
E-an
Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
Isn't he the best?
(under her breath) Ya that'll happen)
What?
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
Ah.
I thought that was pretty good, huh?
What is this?
So what are you going to do?
Oh, baby.
Yeah!
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
This is nice.
No, no, not Putumayo.
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
He's coming up?
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
You look ridiculous in that thing.
Is George here?
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
Kurt!
What does he do?
Ill see ya. (Hanging up the phone)
Nothing.
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
What the--
I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
Must wean.
(Just making conversation) Oh yeah?
(shrill) You're engaged!
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
How could you not take the directions?
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm)
Okay.
(quiet) Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.
James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!
(to George) I'm gettin' his mail.
You're right Maestro.
[Proudly] Really?
I'm not even in here!
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
Kramer, they're painted on!
Oh my God.
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
Anna...
I thought you hated Los Angeles.
But, that didn't happen to you.
Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
Yeah, you want five?
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
Yeah me too.
(head in arms) I know--
Where's Jerry?
Kramer!!
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
Exactly.
How do you do that?
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
Some night, huh?
Twenty-five percent.
He'll only play with his racquet
Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
So, where's Todd?
Hi, I'm Elaine.
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.
You did didn't you.
How did you know you cut it?
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
... hiking ...
Are the clubs there?
Yeah!
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
I'll take it.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
All right. Whiff away.
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
..And then there were three.
Oh, yeah.
She's the one you went out with last night?
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
What is that?
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
We're just, you know, having a good time.
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
No, I really don't.
Uh-hu. And do you know what happened?
Right. African.
You speak Burmese?
Can you believe this woman?
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
(happy gasp) Oh.
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
What?
Yeah. Hah.
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
Oh yeah.
[exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.
You were?
Uh huh.
(sighs Wa-ah) I don't know...a year?
I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
Kramer, we like her.
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
"Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those..."
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
Jon Voight? The actor?
I wish.
So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
Why? What's wrong with it?
WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.
Two, three hundred?
I guess I'll just--
Well, how are we gonna do it?
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
I am not buying a computer from you.
But why? Why can't you do it?
(sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
Why do they call it a wedgie?
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
You wanna go out with him?
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
What?
... date with Fred.
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
Oh, hello.
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
Oh.
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
Well,
Oh, you know what? He got engaged.
(improvising) I said, uh, some snuggly baby.
Really?
How is that?
Get out! What'd you do?
(she fakes a strangling) RRR...
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
Would you please?!
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
Here's a thought - Bye bye.
It's that bad?
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
Yeah, so?
Yeah. What is this all about
(offering a drink) Snapple?
Yeah.
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
Again you are telling me to shut up?
Mmm
We do what we can.
(Through intercom) Yeah.
Are you actually considering this?
Yeah, I don't know what that means.
(to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?
I didn't hear anything.
He's incredible.
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
I thought you had done this before.
Oh, mine's "Ike".
O.K. Thanks.
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh man, hes nuts.
George...
Youre getting what?
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
Yeah.
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
I don't wanna!
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
I like Julie. She's very personable.
Yeah, they don't know.
I guess.
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
You don't like them?
Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.
Hey. Is that your horse outside?
...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'
Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
.....Hi.
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
Mr. Costanza, I,
He wrote a song about it!
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
The astronauts use them.
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
Hi.
Then why didn't you take it?
(gleeful) The fish!
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
Shot.
(Passionately) Oh Bob! Bob!
Judy, hi, listen...
What statue?
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
That's not gonna do anything.
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
Do any of these look close?
What do I need this for?
Ned must have left it here.
Hey, I didn't get one either.
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
Was it a cup or a bowl?
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
Right there.
What happened?
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
Well...
(engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm.
What do you do?
What? What are you trying to say, George?
Great.
Ahh, yeah, sure.
where's Tony?
Hey.
Hey.
Because you have an attitude.
Is that something?
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
(Sarcastically) Oh, that is really mature.
Huh?
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
Paul?
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
No. Do you ever think about it?
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
And I said I hadn't seen her.
Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?
An Armani suit?
Get off of me!!
Oh yeah? Can I see it?
Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
I did?
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
I think he emphasized "would."
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
Wha...?
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
No! I won't!
(laughs) What?s all this?
I hate this.
Uh... sure/yeah..
Oh no, lets do it now.
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
Okay, this is quite a place.
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
Great music.
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
Hi, Jer.
No thanks.
(to George) Ya see?
So how's it going with my friend?
What? What?
We made plans.
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
So?
toilet paper
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
This food was in the shower with you?
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
You got the tickets right?
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
Hi.
(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
Joel...
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
Yeah, I think I might.
On some people.
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
(gasps) I cannot believe this!
(quietly) I can cancel.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
excuse me, do you have a tissue?
Maybe he likes her.
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
Is it *real* butter?
Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.
What'd they say? What'd they say?
what is it?
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
Yeah that! So, . . .
Why didn't you stop me?
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
Well..hum...let me rephrase that, She said....
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
Oh, it was a frame-up.
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
Heh?
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
Oh, that's nice!
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
Yeah.
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
Fine.
Not bad huh?
Alright, I'm heading over right now.
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
What? What is so funny?
That's at the airport, right?
You mean..?
Yeah.
Huh?
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
Really.
You never know.
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
I never should have given Anna the impression--
What? No Jerry, you have to go.
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
Kramer.
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Fine, go away.
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?
You oughta at least take a look at it.
A big coincidence.
Yeah, but you like the face painting.
Oops! (bumps into Levitan) 'Scuse me.
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
Are you going down?
Hmmm, I dont think so.
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.
(quietly) I,...
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
Hi.
(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
Yeah, that's him.
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
You're not too cold?
I just don't get it.
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
(making a face) "Moland"?
You see? Again.
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
And what times the funeral?
You're soo good lookin'.
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
Oh, sure.
What was it?
Right
Hey, is that real fur?
It,s, it's up to you.
Pliers?
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
How was it?
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
Oh! Do tell sir?
Oh ya.
Yeah? What was it?
I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.
Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
(to Kramer) ...Kramer.
Yeah, yeah, that too.
No thanks!
"Yeah. What happened was...."
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
Hey.
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
Here in this little apartment?
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
uh huh (very quietly)
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
Hi! How 'r u doing?
Yeah, yeah.
Jeannie... your fiancee.
Well, uhm... I...
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
What is the problem?
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
Where did you go?
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
Wh..?
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
Oh.
I didn't say anything.
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
Whats the rent?
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
( knocks) Hello is anybody here?..
Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
Where would I take the test?
What?
Yes! Couldn't you see that?
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
Cleaning supplies?
Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
That's so, that's so sweet.
Home.
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
Ohh.. my..
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
Hi!
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
(to the black waitress) Long day?
Why didn't you just call out his name?
Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
Gimme ten bucks and find out...
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
Robin!
What?
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
What? Why not?
Some house, huh?
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
That's ridiculous.
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
What?
What is a bender anyhow?
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
Burma.
Why?
"What are you..crazy?"
Hey, Joe Mayo.
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
(as though receiving a revelation) Poppies!
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
What'd you have?
Oh, that is so sweet.
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
So, the only reason ...
Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous.
So where do you get this note?
It's me.
Yeah? So?
Na.
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
(Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
"It's me?" Isn't it a little premature?
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
I don't know.
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
How do you know?
Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.
He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
Un-huh.
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
Oh, you want one?
Right.
Huh.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
What is it?
Head to toe.
So. What is she?
They took Babu away?!
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
Hi Cosmo
Hey.
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
Do you think it's a coincidence?
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
We, there are always a few.
What is wrong with George?
*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
Yeah. That's right.
What are you doing?
Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
No. We were both in the mood for one.
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
Why?
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
Yeah.
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
Enjoy. (she leaves)
How high did I go?
Great...
Just a little off the side...
(discouraged) Five days. Here.
She keeps track of everything.
Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!
Well, that's because you're an idiot.
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
Very near.
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
The remote goes through the bubble?
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
Yes, yes.
Vincent?
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
No, Chinese.
I can't believe what's going on out here.
(puzzled) You? What're you doing here?
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
And I want my keys back from you!
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
You weasels!
Uh, kind of.
"Well. Were you tucked?"
(picking up) Jerry!
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
Correct.
The kitchen?!
What?
Are you?
To please Mr. Pitt.
(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
Hmm. (she nods in agreement)
(with pain) Hi Evelyn.
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.
How could that be the dog?
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
Well use a paper towel.
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
Very funny. That's very funny.
[mind] What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy.
Ask Jerry.
So, what d'you think?
No. I don't want him looking.
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
No, I just have a cold.
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
Really?
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
Well that's not sex.
Yeah, how's the doctor date?
Can we do this later, George?
Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.
Yes (clears her throat) yes I did.
I don't buy it.
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
Hello.
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
Hi.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
No it isn't.
Yeah.
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
Yeah.
Hey, how we doin' on time?
We'll have to sleep head to toe.
(uncomfortable) Ooh.
Good workout?
It's Elaine.
Yeah
Just give it back to him.
Yeah, really great.
What? Just 'cause of that?
Ohhh!
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!
Hello?
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
Oh, that's insane.
Yeah.
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
Hey, we told you not to park there!
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
You mean lying to your uncle?
Oh, hi Dan.
Exactly.
No. You got the wrong number, kid.
I just thought I could write it.
What soup place?
That's great George.
Wow, invitations again...
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
(indicating) You remember Katy?
Yes, his name is Hal.
I got some for you.
Hey!
'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
Hello?
Yeah.
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
Night.
There was a bit of an accident.
Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms...
Hi Peggy.
So what are we gonna get him?
Yeah, tell im George.
(Yelling out) He's got nothin'!
I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
Book it.
But you said no more painting.
Oh I did?
Huh.
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Uuhhh.
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
(enters) Hey.
It's not such a bad name.
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!
Really?
What are you talking about?
Huh! Sexy?
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
it's Elaine
Oh my!
We've got a good team.
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
What?
There's some kasha.
Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.
Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
(grasping the concept) Ohh.
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
Heres your plane ticket.
Jerry--
What do you think their parents think?
Mmm. De-lish.
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
What?
Come on, what is taking you so long?
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
No, no, I'm leaving.
Yeah
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
Its disgusting.
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
Televising opera?
Okay, welp... see you around.
Sigh/Ugh.
No, I don't think so.
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
Uh huh.
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
I don't understand.
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
What's goin' on?
He told you all that? How could he?
Yeah, I suppose.
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
It shrinks?
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
I think it's B.O.!
Bravo!
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
Hi
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
Huh. (muttering) This should be interesting.
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
What is that noise? What is that noise?
Ooh.
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
(hands them over) You can have 'em.
She won't even give you a hint?
Wait a--
Uh huh.
Oh, okay.
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
He could have died
Yeeeahh!!!
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
All right. He kissed me. Okay?
(warning) Jerry.
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
Go.
Because it's really nobody's business.
Like... (doing it) Like this?
I got him a two-line phone.
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
Christmas present? For who?
You know, I'm going as a beard.
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
Ok, ok ok ...
Do you go in the shower?
Ah...
Jerry, my leg.
No, No...
Mmm, this is delicious.
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
What?
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
How can you possibly show your face there again?
Oh. Thank you.
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
Yeah!
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
Pooh...(laughing)
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
I know.
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
What, what is it?
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
Make it clear?
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
You should run for mayor.
Hi Jerry!
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
What's your line?
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
Shall I undo it?
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
hi
Why not?
Yeah. I know. Me, too.
So, you're gonna get a new couch?
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
Ugh!
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
(pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.
I dance fine.
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
Uuh.
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
Lena Small?
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
What?
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
We're engaged?
Do you have to?
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
Hey Jerr...
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
What? What did I do?
I'm white.
All right! You know what, just forget it!
I do.
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
You were you, but, you werent you...
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
(Quick) What situation? I have a situation?
I said I'm sorry.
You look a little stressed.
Couldnt agree more.
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
You really think he wants the bike?
No!
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
You think Ihave grace?
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
Hey. Hi Maestro.
I think it would be romantic.
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
Well, she wants you to like her.
What's the difference?
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
You already ate?
We found it. I can't believe it!
Who Gendason?
Five minutes.
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
So, waddya' going to do?
The black and white?
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
"He's smart...."
Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know.
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
It's just a stupid movie.
He thinks you're a phony?
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
He's good.
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
Heyyyyyy (leaning in, very friendly and happy)
Where are you going?
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
Yep. Yeah..
Oh, thank you.
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
I don't like this, it is to easy.
Why not.
Oh!!!
(distractedly) Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make...
Oh.
With the car!
"Well, what kind of shirt was it.?"
Yeah..Yeah...
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
(embroidering) Some corn.
(bearing up) I'm fine.
Happy Festivus, Georgie.
You've never felt remorse.
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
Yeah.
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
Quiet! So where is this Sophie?
Do you smell something?
(Chuckles)
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
(shocked) Blaine!?
Oh, nothin'.
Right there.
Well it was easy. Really.
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)
(makes an irked noise)
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
Really?
Why?
Sure!
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
(touched, she takes it) Aw, Glenn.
I still don't see what the big deal is.
No no - me first.
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
No, but there was nobody sitting here...
What else?
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
Yep! just you and Kramer.
Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
Hey hey
Really?
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
I've got that magazine article for you.
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
Wait up!
The sax player?
You can say that again.
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
That's impossible...
Come in, come in.
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
What? No, no, I'd rather...
What was that?
He actually went to the hospital?
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
hey you got a problem with Tony?
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
Hi.
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
Yeah.
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
You lie.
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
Good morning.
Missing?
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
Who's Reilly?
So the trip was good?
Uhh. No George!
(fierce) I will!
Hello.
Is that with the parts and labor?
Literally.
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
What letter?
Uh, excuse me.
(meekly) Yes ma'am.
Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.
(sighs)
Hey guys...
What?
but what else did they say
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
Yeah? What else?
You think I should have asked George?
I don't know about that.
(on the buzzer) Buzz me.
Did you have a nice ride?
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
You got me a note?
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
Let me test-taste that. (tastes Jerry's yogurt)
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
You can't let him get away with that!
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
Oh...hi, Sidra -
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
Jerry, the man is a doctor.
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
No, he's not.
Elaine Benes.
No. Why would you think that?
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
It took him like ten seconds!
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
Hi!
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
You're very special.
Yeah.
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
It's almost stupid if we didn't.
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
Is anything wrong?
A wedding?
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
All right, Jerome, I'm in.
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
Really?
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
(laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
Really? You really missed me?
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
Thanks a lot.
Well we can take the car service from my office.
Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.
Huh. All right. Come on.
Yeah, yeah he is. (as she leaves)
Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
Tim.
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
Shut up and pack!
No, no, I'll be back.
During Schindler's List?
Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?
What's happening?
You did enough.
Yeah.
(accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you.
(unsure) Oh-kay.
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
No!
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
Could you put it in a big bowl?
(pause) Man, Hands?
(exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?
You're getting warm.
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
(breathy) Bye.
Oh. Have you been out?
Alright, that's enough of this.
Jerry, I've always loved ..u..
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
Oh good.
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
Haven't you done enough to these people?
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
What is the difference?
(To Ping) I did not jaywalk.
George. How come you're whispering?
Call him again.
(Getting up to leave) Alright.
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
Got to *love* the Drake!
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
Yeah, I suppose I am.
hey
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
The cat.
No problem.
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
"All right, I'm gone"
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
Well, I don't.
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
(uh-oh) Her?
I know!
Noo!
Good for you.
Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom)
Jackie says put it on, Jerry.
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
How'd it go? George?
(disappointment) Aww. Sold out.
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
A *lot* of weight. (enthusiastically)
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
People go to South America.
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
I know.
Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
Yeah.
Say what? (laughing) Say what?
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
So what?
Yeah.
I *love* the Drake.
"Who's the Drake"?
Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue.
What? KRAMER, I'll do anything.
(emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs)
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
Fine! Were through!
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
How is it talking?
No, I got caught.
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
Today?!
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
Andre?
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
What?
Oh, OK, see you later.
uh.
I'm afraid of dogs now.
Hey!
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
Ha, I didn't mention it.
But you were!!
What?!
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
I guess it was just a matter of time.
Ohhh, it's coming in already!
So?
(sarcastically, to George) Stay!
Hi.
I dont know what your parents did to you.
I smell cherry.
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
What about me?
(surprised) George!
Would you just, let it go?
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
Her type? What type?
Alright thats it! Were back together!
Isn't it going the other way?
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
Street toughs took my armoire?
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
You know you're chippin' in.
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
Are you OK? What? What?
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
Hey! Guess who's not married.
Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
Nah! They're fake!
Oh, wasn't that terrible?
Wow, look at that ring.
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
What list?
Huh?
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
Hello, Frank.
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
You know, that button looks very familiar.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
(looks straight into his eyes) Jerry.
Why not? That's all I want.
Hi.
It's me.
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
All right. Take it easy.
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
Why not?
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
An IQ test.
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
What, Uh oh?
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
What did I say?
Is that tomorrow?
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
What exactly was that kid?
What?
(impatient) Come on!
You can still go.
(to Nina) Hello!
What? Well, who's gonna do it?
No.
Peach.
Yeah?
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
Yes! 212.
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
I've got to go
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
What is going on with you two?
"He thinks you're mentally challenged."
No.
And I am not coming back!
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
Yeah, that's too bad.
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
Do you mean "reer?"
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
Well, maybe.
Okay.
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
I don't know.
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
Oh, Jeffrey.
Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?
Opium?
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
Ah (hu ha - small laugh)
Elaine Benes?
Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing)
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
Hello.
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
What?
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
That is not the point.
Yeah. Who sent you that one?
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
Too bad.
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
Shut up, George.
Whatever.
(wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
What if a handicapped person needs it?
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
No no no, they weren't here before.
Well! Well, it could be you.
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
She said you're getting together Saturday night!
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
I though I'd never find it.
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
Who is it?
No.
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
Set.
What?
George?
Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?
(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans.
Yeah, I am.
Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
Uh, this is,
I know.
You told them that?
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
Because they're turning your teeth green?
That's a good idea.
How do you even know the jacket is there?
(Mock sympathy) Well.. David, it happens.
You'll do well, you're smart.
I think it's unconscionable.
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
It was..uh.. John-John.
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
(to George) Mm-hmm.
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
Hi, Mr Peterman.
All right. I'll be back.
Babu Bhatt did it.
(passing him the ketchup) Oh, sure.
Jerry, Jerry.
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
I know he belches a lot.
No there has got be a mistake.
I know that look.
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
[delightedly] Oh! You "pillage and plunder"?
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
Please, please. It's really, really itchy.
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
Im doing great.
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
that's right honey, and I know you!
Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.
But I got my own note.
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
Oh...my God.
Why?
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
Sure.
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
Theyre very clean animals.
I...I don't know...
What is that?
"Yeah! Mel Torm, That's his nickname."
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
You didn't know.
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
"Aaaaaahhh! He is?!"
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
Yeah, so?
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
Wall street.
You left your door open.
You sure? Anything?
Your crazy!
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
"Ha...."
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
get, um, started..
Search... for Spock?!
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
Uh-huh.
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
no it is not
You're a taking person.
I did.
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
He did the move.
Ok....
Oh, Mr. Peterman.
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
No, I mentioned the bisk.
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
Reggies? I can't eat anything there.
Youre pregnant.
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
I think he's got ideas.
No, thats too much money to borrow.
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
What is that?
What is that?
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
What?
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
Shall we stop and say hi?
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
Ah.
(Sourly) I'll make a note of it.
I didnt get that joke either.
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
Oh!
Oh, could you please hurry?
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
Is he black..
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
Have a good game.
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
Winona is a Native American.
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
my god, you didn't.
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
Don't be ridiculous.
Well, it's just one more day.
Where are they goin'?
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
My god, George!
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
What do you care?
Really!
"I'm going to that!"
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
Hi.
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
Me too
No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
We have to break up.
Yeah...
"Do you wanna go or not?"
Well...
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
Who's stopping you?
Hi.
Yeah.
Are you alright?
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
(Correcting herself) Maestro!
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
It looks good.
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
Really, like when?
Must have been an accident...
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
I'm so sorry George
(off camera) Huh.
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
Yes, exactly.
(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
No that's Radio!
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
Yeah, worked out good.
Oh, god.
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
(looking in her purse) Oh, here.
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
You're not still thinking about that are you?
Hi.
Kramer, you look terrible.
Is there a table ready?
See ya'.
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
George, I just don't want you interfering.
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
What?
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
(exhales) They're going to be heroes.
This is my bike!
Hey! Gail!
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
uh, ha.
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
What?
The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
You gotta open the vault.
Should you be smoking?
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
Still?
Can I offer you anything to drink?
So then why are you seeing her again...
Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
Albano is your last name.
(giggling) Oh.
If I was saying something I would have said it.
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
Hi.
Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
What, Ocean.
Hmm. I never take them.
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
It's garbage.
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
You flinched.
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
And... hes hilarious.
New jeans?
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
why does she have to chew so many?
Nothing. He walked me home.
It can be very frustrating.
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
(quietly) Ok.
But why? Why don't you want to?
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
Tomorrow .
What?
Went out with Cynthia.
yeah
Yeah I am still holding.
Yeah, you *could*...
Ooh!
Do I know anyone??
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
(surprise) Hey, what're you guys doing here?
Oh no.
He tells him which soap to use.
I should have never left him alone.
Oh my god, where is it?
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
They were?
Well podiatrist.
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?
He's a musician.
In the back.
Why not?
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
No!
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
Well, why didn't you say no!!
Oh! I forgot to tell you--
So? What'd they say?
Excuse me.
Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.
What?
They're signing the papers next week.
We just got along *so* great.
Mmmnn, Georgie!
No.
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
Well, Fred asked me out.
What are you doing?
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
And you get along well with women.
Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder.
Hello.
You can't! You can't do this now!
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
What?
Hi/Hey.
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
Who are they?
Why are you yelling at the TV?
No?
I know.
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
"What are you talking about?"
You wanna know what I said?
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
Well, that was fast!
Did you get a thank you wave?
He'll be here.
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
I hate the good ones.
She sent you a Christmas card?
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
I've always loved ... United Airlines.
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.
That's sounds pretty juvenile.
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
C'mon.
How many?
So? Where were you?!
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
Aha.
So what?
I'm looking for Kramer.
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
No,
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
"Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye."
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
[laughs appreciably] Okay, gimme the `adult'.
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
So, he's...
(delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman.
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
Hello father.
I went to visit him.
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
W..well, can't I come in?
(sits beside Jerry) What?
Why?
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
Right...
Bye.
About five.
Uh, no, I'm OK.
Ohh... its snowing. Its beautiful.
uh-uh.
I don't believe this.
Bye.
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
I don't think so.
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
Okay.
Statute.
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
You did.
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
Yes it is.
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
So, its the same thing.
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
you can't spare it??
Well, one of those glasses.
He told you about our conversation?
At the movies.
... and biking and ..
No, but that's one problem. Why?
I can't believe this!
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
Where are you going?
Hi. Nice to meet you.
What's going on?
Hi, Judy.
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?
No.
Oh-oh, but-
Guess what I ate.
Ghandhi?
Fine.
Oh! really.
Oh..Nice to meet you.
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
What's up?
Oh, sure.
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
(Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
Hi, I'm Elaine.
(Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.
Who's he?
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
You can't tell me?
Oh, of course.
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
Yeah, yeah, thanks.
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
Whats going on? What is that look?
Have you thought about an intervention?
(at the same time) Yes, yes.
Oh.
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
85?
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
(to self in head) Bizarro world..
Where's my water?
Why are you talking about my shoes?
What are you writing? Doctor.
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
Really?
Ga-ga? When did that happen?
(To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
Go talk to her.
Where did you find it?
That's the janitor closet, across the street.
Portuguese?
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
(on buzzer) It's me.
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
(to George) Are you happy now?
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
Because it's rude, otherwise.
Hello.
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
Well, I am the President.
No, No....Yesss!!!!!!
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
(dryly) Yeah, too bad.
Mrs. Oliver?
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
Yeah.
Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.
You didn't hear me buzzing?
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
Oh...nuts.
Someone I know!
Hmm.
What about this candelabra?
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
Will you shut up? I can't hear!
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
Jerry, He's A GUY!
Well done. (pats George on the shoulder)
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
Well, I'm dating a communist.
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
How do you know his name?
I can find out.
You haven't told them yet, have you?
Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke!
Wha'd you get on your SAT's?
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
What's the matter with him?
(Confused) Love newton?
Black Forrest?
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
Oh, no! I thought--
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
(pause) Oh. That's nice.
Yeah.
The Soup Nazi!
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
Ah, no.
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
Good. Now fix me a drink.
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
So what are you going to do?
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
I've got no room.
Who's that?
What?
Hey!
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
What if it worked out?
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
So we're having dinner tonight?
Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...
Are you sure you want to do that?
I need something to read on the subway.
Jerry, I'm on the other line.
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
What is this about?
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
Yeah, she'll be here any second.
Okay, c'mon it's movie time.
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
Yeah yeah, ok.
No.
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
Yeah.
Hi!
What do you mean bald?
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
Oh.
Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!
Really?
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
You know... (looking up) the spirit world.
What's with the claw?
Yeah.
Right. Go right!/South!
(flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice.
Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
Alright, let's do it.
Hey, did you get a massage yet?
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
Let's make it fifty.
7.0
Hello.
Oh are you?!
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
I am?
No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
Yeah...
At least it wasn't atomic.
Ohio?
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
Yeah..heheah (laughing a bit)
Im just curious.
No.
Try it on.
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
The Truth!, You want The Truth?
I'm plumb out.
Hi.
But...Jake...
I had to take it again.
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
You are!?!
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
I know. I need a lesson.
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
Seven?
Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
Oh it was such a great night.
No, of course not.
Eatin' olives.
(looking at Jerry) Ohh.
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
Hi, it's me.
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
How do I look, Jackie?
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
Hi George.
Oh yeah, the curse toast.
(Whispering to Jerry) Hey.
Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
Yeah, that's right.
No.
It's okay, you don't
So what movie are you guys seeing?
Oh, yeah?
Kramer!
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
Hey George.
I thought you were hungry.
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
Fusilli Jerry?
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
hates it
I'll see you.
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
"War and Peace."
This. My office. Sam trashed my office.
I'm *really* hungry!
So you consider this a relationship?
Told me what?!
What? A health plan?
You don't have the label maker, do you?
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
That is so ridiculous.
What do you think of the catalog?
Hey, Puddy.
What?
Me too.
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
I didn't say anything.
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
So what? That's easy.
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
Then why get the massage?
You didnt.
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
How could this have happened?
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
Right.
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
(Shrugging it off) eh.
Yeah? Well, so am I!
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
(Giving up too easy) Okay.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.
Well, what is it?
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?
A little stale.
I guess we could've called for help.
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.
So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
Thirty-seven.
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
George, come on! I'll pay for you.
Oh, hi! (Waves at him)
What? You never told me that.
What?
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
Oh, all right, James. He he he
Hey!
what is with the gum?
I can't get off the kishkas.
Sure - the video.
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
Oh, no, I-I don't think so.
(spoken to Testikov) that's a song
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
I like feet too. Im just saying
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
What's the difference?
How long have you two been together?
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys.
He is a Maestro.
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
Yep.
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
Yeah.
Mmmm.
Why are you so concerned about this?
You know I really hate my clothes.
Hey.
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
Let's start the bidding.
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
Oh, I dont know..
Real good!
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
How'd you manage that.
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
(resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman.
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
Hey.
I got stuff to do.
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
Milk?
(Overly generous) Hi, David!
Just me and George?
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
I don't mind skunk.
But you said it was in the store!.
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
Will you turn around?
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
Melrose Place?
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
I am his nurse... Poloma.
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
I knew it! You're a regifter!
Yeah.
Hi.
What?
It's for George.
Hi. Can I get to my seat?
Who was Pippi Longstocking?
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
(horrified) Get together!!
Hello.
Egh, Jake Jarmel?
He sat in mud. Not you.
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
No, you look pale.
Arrive?
What? What is goin' on with you two?
Cash?
Who's faking?
I kinda like her.
(Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
Give me the money.
No it's not.
When's Rachel comin' out?
Now look, don't take too long.
Theyre coming in?
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
The pick?
So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh)
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
Isn't that blue car him?
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
I lied
A little.
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
Yes it is!
Couldnt be happier.
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
They deliver it.
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
Eight-fifty.
(sneezes)
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
The roommate's.
Forget it.
No, actually, you're not being funny now.
No?
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?
Oh, cristal clear!
Oh my God!
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
Oh! (comes to him)
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
Since when do you wear cologne?
So what?
Okey-dokey.
(Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
Great... [To herself] Help me...
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.
Hi.
So what'd you do last night?
What?
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
I didn't say it.
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
Why? Because I can?
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
It doesn't matter.
Hi Sue Ellen.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
I attend to his personal affairs.
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
You're lucky I don't report you...
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.
(to Jerry) Five more days?
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
Those school zones are a killer.
Justin Pitt?
Okay, I'm done.
Can he fix it?
Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.
Wrong side?
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
Well, they have to give up some time, they can't stay out there all night?
Yeah, nice to see you, too.
No.
(tossing the ball back) Yeah.
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
It is obtrusive, isn't it?
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
Tomorrow evening, sure.
So? Then what?
It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.
I'm having people over.
O.K., fine, I have...no grace.
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
Yea why not?
Oh, you have to say something.
Ach, maybe.
(Casually playing along) So what?
She was lost...
You encouraged her to get one.
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
Hey.
(forcing a smile) Hi.
There's no Big Salad.
What?!
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
Yeass.
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
(laughing).
(enters) Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.
He's sixty-six years old.
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
What?
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"
Sure. Water Pik, floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.
Why? Is it irrevocable?
But he's okay?
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
Huh?
Because, it is what she does.
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
He can't go left.
It is so forgotten.
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
"Yeah!"
You still have no proof.
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Oh no.
Because... Yeah?
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
Hi.
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
What black guy?
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
What kind is that?
What about Georgie?
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
Yeah
Hmm!
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
Are you coming with me?
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
yeah, all right ok
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
How did you get that job?
Very much.
Hi.
Correct. (catches herself) What's that?
Yeah.
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
Yes! Grace!
Dad thinks George is gay.
But you lied first.
What're you stopping here for?
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.
Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?
 Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!
Kramer...
Yes it is.
 Hi! How are you?
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
This guy I'm seeing.
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
Oh, Come on.
What did you have to say that for?
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
Her too.
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
What?
I didn't know you SMOKED.
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
Get a hold of yourself!
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
Why?
Hey.
Do you want something to read?
Jesus?
You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
Uh huh.
At work?
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
Yeah
You stole her clock?
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
It... works!
Forget it!
Im kinda full.
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
Yeah?
I know.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
Cause then I could move in here.
Kramer!
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
Well...
No, no. Im fine.
What are you doing? What is all this?
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
You can go.
I don't know. What do you think?
'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
I don't eat Oreos.
So? What do you want me to do about it?
Jerry?!
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
I don't want to keep him waiting...
Huh, go ahead, tell him.
This is it. Wish me luck.
OK.
(giggles)
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
No. I'll just walk home.
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
I met him.
It was a joke...
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
Oh. Well, Usha.
(to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.
Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?
See what?
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
Can I just have the name...
Hmm. Sickies.
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
No.
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
Fish don't feel any pain.
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
(positive) Oh! (little chuckle)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
Oh, all right.
Between a peck and a make out.
Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?
Hi, Michael!
Hey!
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
So? What happened?
Mm-hmm.
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
No, No that's my purse!
It looks exactly like me.
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
I thought you were busy tonight.
I gave him an ultimatum.
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
(shakes head) No.
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
Hey, Arnie's just as upset.
Get it out!
(sarcasm) Alright, good job.
(smiling and flirty) Hi.
Oh, my God.
Hear what?
What do you mean, like laundry?
You got me cash?
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
(Confused) What combination?
See, what did I tell ya?
(Smiling, proud) I said, "yeah."
Oh, we forgot to pick a number.
Ah, well.
Uh, I guess I hadn't--
Yeah, see ya.
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
(stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back.
Excuse me.
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.
Oh, they won't?
She's not bitter!
(she leaves hurriedly) I gotta gooo...
Hi! This is my friend George.
Hey, what are you doing?
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
What is it?
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
400 sugar fix.
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
I, uh, wait,
Get out!
(mouths silently) That's perfect!
YES! yes. You saw him on TV.
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
Why? What happens if you don't order right?
Tia? Who's that?
There's nobody I can go with.
Alright, alright.
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
Seems to be.
Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.
Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
Uh, don't worry, he's cool.
I am never going back to the movies again
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
Su-sie?
What's this one?
Aha ha ha (laugh)
Yeah, who's he?
Oh that's origi-
Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
What the hell was that?
(Confused) What is wrong with this book?
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
Jerry's a nazi?!
How old are you?
What does that mean?
Look at that woman.
Mr. Peterman.
Well Jerry told me that you did.
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
(overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!
No, no.
It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
I don't know - it just is.
He is not a drug addict!
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
I can't say that.
Nuthin'. Then he took me home.
Ya.
Noo, thanks.
Wait, what pizza place idea?
So? What happened?
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
Can we rest here a second.
(dread) No, no, no, no, no.
They're um, Botticelli's.
(Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm.
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
(CONT'D) Where have you been?
I didn't take your napkins.
You're... poor AND married?
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
So... impudent.
Really....but I barely know you.
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
Oh, the guy with cancer?
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
Yeah, like a swoosh.
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
Oh, Please.
How do you know that?
What d'you think?
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
It was an accident.
(as Darryl opens his door) Hey.
Thank you very much.
No they don't.
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
How much do you want for it?
I don't know.
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
Aah! Okaaay.
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
Anyway, so how was the dinner?
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
But what??
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
What is with him?
Oh.
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
Jinx buy me a coke.
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
I'm not telling you.
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
So?
What if it's your hair?
I do.
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
She's not gonna twirl--
(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.
Oh, he's...he's a joy...
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
What do I have to know?
Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
Because! Because she missed her period!
Oh, hi Fred.
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
(setting down her glass) Oh, ya haha.
All right, what the hell.
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
Why not?
No, Castro.
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
Who was it?
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
Yeah? Well, I got news for you.
(Suddenly angry) What?!
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
We try.
Just in those commercials.
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
All right, pile it on.
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
Did he crumble any crackers in it?
So what did you say?
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
What's the matter with you?
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
What is your answer to number 74?
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
Who's this guy?
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)
Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)
Twisted? God, I did you a favor.
hell-oo
I tought you didn't like double dates.
You got a comfort problem there?
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
Got it.
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
Well maybe you should call him.
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
It's the next best thing to being alone.
At Yankee Stadium?
Where you going?
(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
Yeah
Jerry!
What?
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
Oh, did you check you machine?
I...touched...'em.
But he's so small.
Hey.
She gave it to charity.
Yessiree Bob.
(pleased) Ah.
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
No way.
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
Ok,
Ya know?
Ah.
I'm sorry you have to go.
Kramer has a record.
What happened?
What are you talking about?
And vodka.
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
They have big salads.
What?
(looks up, screaming in frustration!) Suuuuuuuuuuze!
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
Oh hey! How things doing in accounting?
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
What about the party? What about the Drake?
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
Oh is that so.
You're quitting?
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
Get out!
So, what are you saying?
You mean like like?
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
That's okay.
Have you noticed she never laughs
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
(excitedly) Okay.
Burma?
He's a human maraca.
Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
He is?
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
He used to be called Peter.
You don't like her?
That was good. That was very good.
I can't believe you said that.
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
Nice to meet you, too!
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
Thanks for the dinner.
Mm. This food is fantastic.
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
I thought he was with you.
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
(gasp) An accident? What happened?
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
Todd.
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
Really?
I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
There are plenty of things to say.
What are you guys doing here?
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
Yeah.
86th and Broadway please.
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
Yeah, that's right!
Congratulations! You passed!
Oh really, you like 'em?
Then how are all these people getting together?
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
My roommate has Lyme disease.
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
Oooh!!
What about the look?
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
I thought she was the one.
I don't think so.
Yeah, but it's only three blocks.
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
KRAMER, are we doing a bad thing?
his face, did something happen to his face?
(screams).
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
Why?
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
(Pausing) Even so.
Yeah, yeah, right.
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
Pick. Up.
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
I'll say.
By marriage.
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
Because I was gooood.
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
Yeah, you can get a gardener.
Uh, no ... take it.
Yeah?
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
No. Your. (breathes)
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
So you know , ... he called me.
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
Its time you got outta here anyway.
According to Puddy.
Fine, fine, fine.
(squeaky) Sure, sure.
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
I'll see you tomorrow.
No, the Green Lantern.
You can't ask a person to change their name.
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
Sure, fine.
Okay.
Hey boys!
Who was that?
I wouldn't be comfortable.
I've got an alarm, ok?
Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)
What?!!
What?
Oh.
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
Oh! The Risotto broad.
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
These things happen.
What-- What are you looking at me for?
Just, very interesting.
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
I'm just thinking about the question.
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
But it's got a pee-stain on it.
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
Hey, have you seen Anna?
Jerry, we don't have time for this...
Grace?
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)
Yeah, I could use a chuckle.
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
What do they do?
I thought I was alone.
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
Superman can go back in time?
You were big.
And then he starts writing on my chart.
Uh oh.
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
Alright, well, now that's something..
Nah, we just play defense.
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
My back.
Where are they?
It could be very confusing.
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
Oh, tons!
These aren't my keys!
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
I told ya.
What? What happened?
Maybe coffee was coffee.
I'm marchin' in.
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
Huh huh.
All right, I'm gonna go.
Jerry, look at my fish.
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
Watch out for that maroon Golf.
(not amused) All right.
My God, are you okay?
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
You're still here. You're a dynamo.
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
What? Clinging to some scraps?
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
No.
I guess.
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.
Out, damn heal!
Oh, I missed you!
A wedding? Have you lost it, man?
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
Oh, but it's ok for me?
You've been an enormous help.
You want to go to India?
Hey.
Aren't you Raquel Welch?
Its great to... talk about... other people...
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
Oh my!
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
so huh, what did the doctors say?
I found it!
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
Why?
Yes. Who it this?
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
No, these are saved.
Oooh no, I don't think so.
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
What?
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
Look, just because I'm a woman...
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
I never saw anyone play like that.
Where did that come from?
Come on, don't be a baby.
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
Mr. Pitt...
Oh.
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
What is so funny?
Chicken wing shoulder blades.
What's with him?
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
Oh, oh, come on, please?
OK. I dont quite know
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
You're wrong.
Yeah, he did.
Yeah, yeah!
I realize that.
(OC) It's me.
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
Oh.
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
(Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?
You're nuts!
Is this Noreen?
I don't blame ya'
No, no, come on. I guarantee it.
Good-bye
I don't think so.
It's black, right?
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go.
Hi. (she flips her hair)
Why would he come to George?
No, no, come on Michael!
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
(Nodding) Yeah, yeah..
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
Hi, Toby.
Get offa me!
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
Hey.
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
Oh, Maestro.
But she broke up with you.
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
What? What?
Lithe.
[mind] This is getting awkward.
So where do you wanna eat?
How are you gonna widen the lanes?
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
Aawwh Please.....
I need some space.
Nana?
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
Oh, yeah. I see him.
Oh, no! Come on Jerry.
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
Ill take it!
He does, how'd you know that?
Whew that was a dozy.
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
JERRY Cosmo
What was that?
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
Well, have they called the police yet?
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
(Sarcastic) Oh.
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
"War-- What is it good for?"!
Hello?
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
You flew here coach.
Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
Hmm. Tonight.
Ok.
Yeah, yeah, hello.
Mr. Peterman?
Ah come on
You took her medicine.
(not convinced) Ech.
Oh, I don't remember them.
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
This chicken is really good.
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
Huh.
(to Paul) You're checking it out?
I faked it.
Oy vey!
Very mature.
So that's it?
Why not?
Oh Jerry, dont blow this for me.
Hello. Jerry's not here?
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
No, milk.
Why?
Yes.
Well he frightened me.
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
I gotta go. (Hangs up.)
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
I can't believe he hasn't called.
Hey, what happened to you?
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
(pause) Bizarro Jerry?
They all are.
(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
Sorry.
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
I can't do it.
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
What's going on?
What are you doin' there?
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
Where are we going?
So, we're going out Friday.
Give it give it ..
Jerry, are you free on Friday?
Too tight?
Ohh!
That seems about right.
What
Yeah, you know, head to toe.
It's a classic.
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
Oh...well...
(hopeful) And?
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
Its OK. (starts walking down the hallway)
Shhhhhh!!!
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
Hello, Jerry.
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
What? What, you dont want to go now?
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
Jerry. Oh there - -
Have you gone in there?
What?
I have no chance, do I?
Have you seen the card?
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
'Cause he gave me his.
She.. was.
Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.
I've touched mine!
Yeah.
Well, it's just a first draft!
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
See'ya.
Right, Joe Divola
Oh, it stinks.
Kramer, you're hurting me!
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
Mr Peterman, you...
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
Yeah, he did.
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
Aah!
I know.
Prognosis... negative.
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
yeah.
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
Been a while?
Mulligatawny?
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
Ha! That's preposterous.
Nedda?
My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carousel.
We're with him, we're with him.
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
You're not serious.
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
Yeah! You're probably right.
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
Stunned by soup?
Okay. We ready to go?
(shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
See you later.
(quietly) OK.
The mannequin!
Wha--?
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
Oh, a puffy shirt.
I can't kick you out of your bed.
Ah, . . .
Alright. Goodnight.
Downtown?
Yeah, Art Vandelay.
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
I thought he was deported.
I wish I could quit...
Let go of my tongue!
(looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen...
Who are you, my uncle?
(hopeful) Oh, you were?
JERRY Hey
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
Hellllloo.
Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.
The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
Who is it?
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
I'm going in .
No, I don't.
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
. Well this is all very flattering...
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
Hmm... No you don't.
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
Excuse me?
Oh, so---so that's it?
Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
What did he say?
Well, that's your problem.
Yes.
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
 Jerry! Over here...
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
No, who?
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
What do you wanna know?
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
I'm a "honey." He's pretty great, huh?
But he used a condom, right?
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
No, no.
Okay...Thanks a lot for the ride.
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
But we need you.
Wanna sit down?
Hello boys.
Oh! (tries to take paper)
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
Boy, you don't look good.
It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
Who told you this
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
Ha hum...Do you like George?
Arghhh, look it's a fire! (cough)
Well, you know, I...
Well they're perfectly edible.
Maybe it's the cold weather.
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
(Leaving Jerry) See ya.
Hi!
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
No, sir, I can't.
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
Yeah?
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
[annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.
Well, who's gonna call?
I can't do that.
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
Yes, she's a dermatologist.
What's he look like?
Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this.
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
Dumb and lazy, I understand.
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
Um uh.
Thank god I found you..
Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down)
Fine!
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
You ditched the fur?
I know, I know, I was unbelievable
(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
So what did he say?
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
Aah!
Oh, GREAT!
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?
Yeah, perhaps.
(Looking up from a menu) Yeah.
Huh?
Now?!
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
(to Kramer) Yeah, so?
That was nothing.
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
What is that stain [on my coat]?
Eleven-thirty?
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
Oh, it's been a while.
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
(weary) Okay.
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
Right... (nodding)
Hey. Where's the car?
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
Well do you see it or don't you?
No, no, he's not my boyfriend.
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
(shrugging it off) Oh.
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
Run down your case for me again...?
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
What little deal?
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.

So what'd you do?
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
(still in disbelief) You painted your face?
Well, there's a doctor right here.
Downtown New York?
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
Do you mind?
Well, it's just two hours by plane...
Ye.
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
I love Cajun cooking.
Well eh, kind of....
It's Elaine.
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
Uh, great!
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
What? What happened to the new Jerry?
Yeah, of course.
Kneel?
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
(Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
Ok.
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
They're going to promote me to editor.
Jerry...
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
(on buzzer) Meh.
What?
Interracial? Us?
A cookie!
Its Elaine.
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
Ah,
What's wrong?
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
(nit) It's Susie.
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
All time.
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
Uh-huh
Oh, of course! She's deranged.
A lot!
What don't you know?
How's it going'?
What is it?
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
Ahh.
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
