Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
Yeah, that's right.
(intercom) it?s me!
I'm not below.
I'm marchin' in.
I need something to read on the subway.
Oh god this tastes terrible.
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
I didn't say it.
Yeah. Right.
Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
Kramer!
Hi!
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
The astronauts use them.
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
What, are you insane?!
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.
Ok....
Bye.
Thought it would be nice.
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
(grasping the concept) Ohh.
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
(not amused) All right.
They deliver it.
Uh huh.
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
Relax--
Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose)
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
What? How?
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
So what?
Ha, I didn't mention it.
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
What little deal?
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
So what are you going to do?
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
Oh, could you please hurry?
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
Oh great, thanks Kramer.
Really?
George, I cannot believe...
No.
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
What happened last night?
Hi E-an
Yeah.
So then what?
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
Why do they call it a wedgie?
Uh, that's, ...
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
Thank you...aah, hm mm.
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
Oh hey! How things doing in accounting?
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
What?
You're eating my food!
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
Good morning, Jackie.
Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?
Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.
Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)
It's not a purse. It's European.
Why?
What's the status?
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
Maybe.
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?
Shot.
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
Drake gave her the TV?
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
Huh, go ahead, tell him.
I still smell!
Vincent?
How can you even consider not going?
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
HUH, so should you.
Aah! Okaaay.
Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
You always break even.
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
930
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
so huh, what did the doctors say?
So what'd you do last night?
Fat.
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
But it's got a pee-stain on it.
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
Well, she has it!
The hit and run!
Who wants cupcake?
(hopeful) And?
Aha hu, You look *terrific*.
Right above you?
Quiet! So where is this Sophie?
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!
Bye.
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
Help him move? Move what?
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
Of course Id pay you back..
Hi.
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
Uhh.
that's right honey, and I know you!
Why not?
I attend to his personal affairs.
About five.
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
Hi!
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
Yeah.
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
What is this?
Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
(Obviously not impressed, dull) Yeah, real nice.
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
What letter?
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
I dunno, at least three weeks.
Ow, ow move over.
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
Hi, Susan.
What are you doing in here with that?
Oh, Hi.
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
(frustrated) Just go.
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
You didn't know.
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
...ok I'll just....
He'll only play with his racquet
Hey, Jean-Paul.
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
Yeah, of course.
Fine.
A little stale.
Its Elaine.
Yay!
He's not my boyfriend.
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Just hold on!
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
Oh, gimme a break..
Don't worry. We won't forget!
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
Hello.
Kramer?
I know he belches a lot.
Why didn't you just call out his name?
Oh...hi, Sidra -
She's not gonna twirl--
Since when do you wear cologne?
[laughs appreciably] Okay, gimme the `adult'.
(frustration) Ugh!
You got something on your mind?
Well, that was fast!
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
Why? What's wrong with it?
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
I hear ya, Sister.
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
Get out!
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
Kramer, the vest just called.
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
Hey, how's your hair?
Sure - the video.
Really?
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
You want to go to India?
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
Oh, please.
. . . What does that mean?
What? What sweater?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
Oh.
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
What? No Jerry, you have to go.
I never should have given Anna the impression--
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
Yeah, tell im George.
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
Do you have to?
Why not?
(firm) No you didn't.
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
Huh?
How about, it sucked?
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
What about the look?
Was it blue?
Ninety-five hundred.
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
ok step off George, can u just step off?
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
You're going to the Tony's too?
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
(To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
I've never seen her before.
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
I'm not surprised.
Hello father.
Hm-hmm.
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
Hi Tina.
George, come on! I'll pay for you.
Nowhere.
Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
Who is it?
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
What's me?
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
So then why are you seeing her again...
Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down)
Uhm...
What?
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
Oh. Are you alright?
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
Bob!
400 sugar fix.
What?
Yes.
Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
What?
Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.
Kramer, you look terrible.
What about me?
Then why did you print it.
On some people.
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
I'm sorry, George, but it's true.
I'm just thinking about the question.
It's ironic.
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
Yeah. Definite moisture.
Get out of my way, Jerry.
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
What kind is that?
He's a human maraca.
Well, actually it's pretty grimy.
We're not wilding.
You're gonna wear this all the time?
Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)
Shut up and pack!
Having a good time!
COSMO?
So? What happened?
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
Oh, right.
Aww.
Tomorrow evening, sure.
what?
He's in.
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
No.
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
Oh! my God.
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
Because we're adults?
Puddy, don't wait for me.
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
(indicating) You remember Katy?
Pal? You think I'm your pal?
Oh...well...
Oh.
Oh, that creepy guy?
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
Hello.
No, there are degrees of coincidences.
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
No!
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
And I am not coming back!
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
G'night, Jugdish. (Laughs)
Isn't he the best?
He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
Jerry. Oh there - -
It was an accident!
Alright, send him up here.
Mind? Oh o-of course not.
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
Would you just, let it go?
What d'you care?
Yeah, but it's only three blocks.
Judy, hi, listen...
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
Christmas present? For who?
(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
You know I really hate my clothes.
Ill hang this phone up right now!
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.
Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
How many?
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.
I got a pebble.
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
So how's it going with my friend?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
No, of course not.
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
Ohh! Stop it! I know.
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
No! I won't!
(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
Well.
I'll take it.
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
What list?
Can I get you anything?
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
Well, a lot of it is vegetable...
A LeBaron?
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
86th and Broadway please.
Yeah.
(upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm)
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
(confused) Jimmy legs?
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?
What? What happened?
Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
George is on his way up.
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
Well,
The kitchen?!
(Into the intercom) Yeah?
I know.
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh I did?
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
All right. Whiff away.
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
(seriously worried) Wha...?
What is this, a 'bit'?
Thank you, Jackie.
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
Hey Jerr...
I know.
Shhhhhh. Here.
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
What?
Yeah, but we have a common goal.
Oh, Mr. Pitt.
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
[exasperated] What is it made of?
(Leaving Jerry) See ya.
(annoyed) Aww, nuts!
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
KRAMER, are we doing a bad thing?
Hello.
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Ah, I'm ready what?
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
Shall we stop and say hi?
[mind] What's he waiting for? I thought he was a cool guy.
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
(to Myra) He's very highly recommended. So...
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
Yup.
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
How do you know all that?
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
Get out!
Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this.
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
So, you're gonna get a new couch?
Is he black?
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
I'd stick.
What's happening?
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
I can't go.
Black Forrest?
Oh, hi! (Waves at him)
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
How do you know that?
Jerry, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go in there and spy on her in the sauna?
I've got an alarm, ok?
Hey, Puddy.
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
How's he gonna chew it?
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
Opium?
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
No not quite.
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
Binaca?
Yeah, yeah.
Fine.
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
How is that?
Uuuhm, all the time.
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
Hey. Oh, is that a label maker?
I did?
Ya
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
Do you realize what youre saying?
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
Can he do that?
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
What exactly was that kid?
I thought you were busy tonight.
(grabbing Puddy) What are you doing?
Its great to... talk about... other people...
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
Oh.
Yeah, you know (scratches cheek and sniffs)
Todd.
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
Yeah.
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
Yes, I would say.
Why?
So. What is she?
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
Yeah.
(Finishing it off) ..done that.
Oh my God.
What?
I'll bet they were even in on it.
Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!
In the back.
(whispers) Poor bastard.
Joe DiMaggio?
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
Aaron? Aaron are you ok?
(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans.
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
No.
Faux pas?
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
(Confused) What combination?
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
Huh huh.
No, Alec Berg.
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
(pleased) Ah.
Hi!
well I don't need much, just 3 squares will do it
Yeah, he did.
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
Excuse me?
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?
You're talking too much!
It looks good.
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
(smiling and flirty) Hi.
(Embarrassed) Free sub.
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
No!
No idea.
Yes, she's very upset.
She.
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
Oh, god.
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
Chilly out.
I don't understand.
you know (acts like a monster)
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
Nice to meet you.
Still?
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
So where are we staying?
What do you got, a cucumber?
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
What about the couch?
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
No!
Seven-and-a-half.
Cherry Binaca, it?s new.
Oh...I don't think so.
(quiet) Look at this turnout.
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
(she leaves hurriedly) I gotta gooo...
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
Yeah. Hah.
I'm okay, it's just a nip.
Jerry--
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
Oh, Jeffrey.
I have to live in a cave.
I'm sure they're not.
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
(resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman.
You're not taking me back?
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
Would you please?
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
Wow! What a story.
"Ha...."
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
Ahh ... wait till you hear this.
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
"All right, I'm gone"
How do I look, Jackie?
Then maybe you have a fax machine.
Yeah, it got pretty nasty.
What did you think, that would impress me?
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
It's a page number.
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
Well we could ...
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
a square?
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
Did he crumble any crackers in it?
Oh, what is this?
Hmm. (she nods in agreement)
Heres your plane ticket.
Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.
I've got no room.
I won't.
(disappointment) Aww. Sold out.
These are terrible.
(on buzzer) It's me.
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
My most, just heartfelt congratulations.
Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
Oh, but it's ok for me?
"Penthouse?"
Jerry, we don't have time for this...
I've lost 6 pounds.
It's me.
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
Yeah
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
You just left? What did you tell her?
Ugh, the hell with 'em.
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
Hey!
Listen to me you little shi........
You get yours out, I was here first!
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
Oooohh, what about me!
Yeah?
Noreen, were you hitting on him?
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
Head to toe.
No, no, that's okay, it's uh...
yeah
(gasps) How did you find it?
(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
What's he look like?
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
It's not serious, is it?
( laughs)Listen, I've used your parents address in Florida.
Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
Well, you know, I...
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
We made plans.
(urgent) Jerry? Jerry?
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
Hey!
Of what?
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
I am his nurse... Poloma.
What does he do?
Just gimme twenty bucks.
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.
I told him I was busy.
(Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
Ugh!
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
No no no no, it's just...
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?
I'm not saying anything.
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
What's that?
Why not?
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
Okay.
I know.
What?!
Is anything wrong?
I know.
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
Yeah, yeah!
You lie.
I know, I know, I was unbelievable
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
Yeah.
What if it worked out?
YES! yes. You saw him on TV.
Yeah! hmmm..I gotta go..
Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
I don't eat Oreos.
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
No, he's just neat.
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
I know! Can you imagine that?
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
So, George... did you get the chair?
(Yelling out) He's got nothin'!
You heard me. Strip!
That's so, that's so sweet.
I can't kick you out of your bed.
It's right over there.
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
I dont know... I dont know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.
No.
(impatient) Get out!
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
Oh, no, I-I don't think so.
NO.
Hey!
What is that?
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
I wish I could quit...
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
(gasps)
No, no. Im fine.
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
You got a comfort problem there?
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
Huh.
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
But I didn't do anything.
No.
Hey, did you make the movie?
I told you, I can't hear a word.
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
I should have never left him alone.
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
Ah, what're you doing here?
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
Uh, kind of.
No.
(Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm.
That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
I knew those condoms were defective!
Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
I know.
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
What are you writing? Doctor.
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.
I do.
Just get the car!
Eh...he'll get up...
No.
uh-uh.
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
Not good. I'm a moron.
According to Puddy.
No.
Uhh. No George!
Phoenix? Whats happening with his appartment?
Tia? Who's that?
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
Oh, tons!
Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
Disappointed?
Heyyyyyy (leaning in, very friendly and happy)
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
(pause) Oh. That's nice.
a ply?
See, what did I tell ya?
No, I don't think so.
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
Hey.
Because I was gooood.
Hey.
Jerry Seinfeld.
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
That is not the point.
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
Why couldn't you just wait?
Uh, Mr. Costanza, I
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
I think it would be romantic.
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
Oh, that is so sweet.
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
So?
No.
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
Well, you know what? (removes glasses)
Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.
My back.
Hey.
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
Seven?
Ah come on
Yeah.
Oh, God!
Oh that's origi-
Hi, it's me.
What're you doing?
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
No, I can't.
Okay, welp... see you around.
Oh. How much you got left?
'...singing a song, side by side...'
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
(exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?
Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
Yeah.
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
All right! I am back in the game.
What's so funny
No.
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
Ilene.
Hello.
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
Alright. Goodnight.
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
No.
Really?
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
Yeah.
did you have fun
Oh, okay, go ahead.
You didn't hear me buzzing?
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
Hey.
Robin? No, why?
(looking in her purse) Oh, here.
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
Well, you're not Superman.
George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
I don't believe this.
Hey! Gail!
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning)
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
Yeah!
Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
I wish I was dead.
Hi.
Oh, oh, come on, please?
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
Wa',you don't have the directions?
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
Yeah, perhaps.
Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...
Yeah. (startled)
(extemporising) Uh... chips.
What?
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
Kurt!
Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.
Why? What happened?
Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
Kramer.
toilet paper
Excuse me?
Okay.
What if it's your hair?
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
Well, you know. It's a picture?
Yeah, I don't know what that means.
Oh.
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
What?
I got him a two-line phone.
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
excuse me, do you have a tissue?
It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
Go talk to her.
Yep. Yeah..
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
Jackie says put it on, Jerry.
Its time you got outta here anyway.
Can I offer you anything to drink?
Hello.
"Aaaaaahhh! He is?!"
Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
Fine, fine, fine.
Mmm, nice to meet you.
Shut up, George.
This is it. Wish me luck.
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
So what'd you do?
"What you do!!. You don't do anything."
Oh...
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
(listening) A little.
Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.
What happened to Bob Saccamano?
(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
Uhh, I don't think so.
Prognosis... negative.
I can't say that.
Yes, his name is Hal.
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
You feeling jiff?
Hey.
I thought he was deported.
(Chuckles)
No, but there was nobody sitting here...
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
What's your Problem?
So tell me more about this game SIX.
Do any of these look close?
What neck hole?
I've never seen you jealous before.
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
I had to take it again.
This is it. I can take this anymore.
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
Hi.
Did you and Patty just break up?
Oh, yeah.
(quietly) I,...
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
Well, I don't.
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
Sauce me.
Look at you. You're on a slant.
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
David and I will not be getting back together.
Come in.
Jerrryyy, How can I go on?
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
(whispering to George) You're up.
Love ... Susan.
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
(Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green.
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
There is no park and the team has relocated.
I like Julie. She's very personable.
Kramer, this is too big.
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
I don't mind skunk.
What did he do?
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
Ah, look who's here. "Silicon Valley."
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
(reading) At the Knights of Columbus?
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
Oh, we forgot to pick a number.
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
You took him over to Celia's?
Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
(pause) What do you mean?
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
Good. Now fix me a drink.
Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
What?
Really?
You told him!!!!
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
Wow. Youre right. That is loud.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry honey.
Oh. Big room?
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
I thought I was alone.
Yeah, but come on . . .
You were?
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
Let's start the bidding.
Dumb and lazy, I understand.
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
He's incredible.
I can find out.
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
Id do it but I dont have any money.
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
You ditched the fur?
Oh, sure.
What is this about?
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
What happened, what took you so long?!
Oh! (comes to him)
Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
Oh, you have to lie.
Thanks for the re-fill.
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
Did you say goiter? What goiter?
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
(from a distance) Hey.
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
Anyway...they're real.
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
No it's not.
Exactly.
Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
Mmm. De-lish.
There you are!
Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
What?
Well, one of those glasses.
"How so?"
Where's my chart? Did you get it?
You think?
(to Nina) Hello!
(neutral) Fine.
Eh.
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms...
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
Oh, OK, see you later.
(looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen...
You can't be bleak in spring.
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
Anyway, so how was the dinner?
O.K., fine, I have...no grace.
(rolling her eyes) Lithe!
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
Yeah, right.
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
yeah
You mean...?
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
Absolutely.
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.
No they don't.
What?
 Jerry! Over here...
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
There is no he.
What did he have to say?
I just don't get it.
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
What?
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
Oh, Come on.
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
What's the matter?
(CONT'D) Where have you been?
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
What did he do?
Literally.
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
No, milk.
Well Jerry told me that you did.
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
where's Tony?
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
She...likes you..
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
w-What is this all about?
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
(quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it?
Yeah, the jewel thief.
Oh my!
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
Ohio?
Why? What happened? Did you talk?
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
That's a pretty big tip...
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
Isn't that a little...rash?
Eleven-thirty?
How much did he save?
Yeah.
Lena Small?
Do you have an apple or anything?
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
What about Switzerland?
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
What's... medium?
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
What's this one?
My, my father?
A lot!
What?
What? You're Cheryl Fong?
I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.
Look at that woman.
Yes I am.
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
I'm sorry but there's somebody else.
All right. Let's go, to Reggies.
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
And then you flush.
(Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.
Yeah.
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
What?
Oh, a puffy shirt.
All right. Let's do it.
(warning) Jerry.
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
Still a 31 waist?
Kramer!
Well I didn't know.
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
Oh, hi, Frank.
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
Who's Sally?
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
uh?
We're not going to sit together?
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
Jerry, Jerry.
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
Fish don't feel any pain.
Elaine Benes.
Hello?
Oh come on.
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
Were you just talking about me?
I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
[heavy sarcasm] Oh. Thanks.
Open your vault.
Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
So how did this happen?
Why is that name familiar?
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
And you feel you're not really ready for,
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
What? What do you need a rope for?
Well, I don't know about "gold."
So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
We found it. I can't believe it!
About three years.
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
(looks up, screaming in frustration!) Suuuuuuuuuuze!
Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces
What?
No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
What?!!
Home.
No, no, come on. I guarantee it.
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
Great.
Me? Why me?
I know.
Oh, of course.
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
Oh, no. Don't!
Uhh
Uh, Mr. Pitt...
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
Oh. Oh God.
She keeps track of everything.
Yeah.
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
Did you read the whole thing?
Have you noticed she never laughs
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
They have a big salad.
Hi, Mr. Lippman.
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
C'mon.
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
That's what I said.
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
George...
It is so forgotten.
Right... (nodding)
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
What was that look?
Oh it's you.
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
(shocked) What?
Nooo, the other thing.
What is it?
Over you?
Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.
Downtown?
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
I'll catch it!
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
Well it was easy. Really.
Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.
Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?
Oh, I don't remember them.
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
This is my bike!
George I don't even want to get --
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
(points) I like Witchy Woman.
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Bye.
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
What? What are you talking about?
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
Hey!
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
Well, at least you're not bitter.
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
What?
Oh Kramer. (They embrace)
Hi.
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)
What the hey.
You know...*the* move.
No, I really don't.
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
That was good. That was very good.
Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
Who's that?
I think it's unconscionable.
"You can't find beauty in a man?"
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
(unhappy) I...
Oh, I
You don't ask.. You tell.
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
We just got along *so* great.
Oh, wonderful!
What's the difference?!!
Okay...Thanks a lot for the ride.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
Yeah, like you must procreate.
W..well, can't I come in?
Hello. This is Todd Gack.
(pause) Bizarro Jerry?
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
Make it clear?
Cows, well that's fascinating...
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
Jerry Seinfeld.
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
Oh.
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.
Sooo, how was your date?
I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
No, I talked him into it.
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
You know... (looking up) the spirit world.
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
Hello boys.
Hey, working out?
Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
You're quitting?
How long have you two been together?
Yeah, but...*I* like the move.
What, is that a rule?
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
He has to go. He may have killed her.
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...
Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
H-his name?
Yeah.
Uh, uh.
(pause) Well... Can I talk to her?
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
He'll be here.
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
Anna...
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
Hey, have you ever fasted?
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
Huh?
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
Couldnt agree more.
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
(Shrugging it off) eh.
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
what?
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
What are you gonna do in there?
Who was that?
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
but what else did they say
What are we gonna do there? Talk?
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
Who's this guy?
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
What are you talking about?
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
Carefully?
"Well. Were you tucked?"
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
Im leaving.
An IQ test.
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
I can't have popcorn for dinner!
Why? You don't wear glasses.
(dismayed) Ah, all o'--all of us?
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
Ned must have left it here.
I dont have five thousand dollars.
(Extremely excited) The other guy?!
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?
What?
Because, it is what she does.
Me?
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
That's okay.
Oooh!!
Burma?
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
How could you not take the directions?
I'm waiting.
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
Nothing.
We certainly have.
Oh, my God.
I thought my idea was just as good.
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
"Ahum!"
Huuh, Wow.
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
Great, great.
Yeah. Upstairs?
(to Kramer) ...Kramer.
What?
Well, that's...that's sweet.
Well I have to be going.
Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, yeah?
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
Well, um, he, he got fired.
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
So what?
We did. We're just hanging out.
(Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?
Hi.
Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.
All right, Jerome, I'm in.
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
(gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.
(embroidering) Some corn.
Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?
I said rubber fire.
What woman?
I thought you were finished.
How?
Right, Joe Divola
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
Well he frightened me.
I said I'm sorry.
I don't think so.
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
I thought George was meeting us here?
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
I'll put in a good word for you.
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
Yes.
Fine. (laughs)
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
(angrier) Thirteen thousand!
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
Well, no, I would hardly--
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
You encouraged her to get one.
Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
You wanna go out with him?
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
I don't know!
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
That's what I'm saying.
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
What? What?
Hmm!
I know. I need a lesson.
(Just making conversation) Oh yeah?
Somethings going on here.
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
That's stealing?
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
(Sarcastic) Oh.
(Leaving) That's fantastic.
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
What?
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
Yeah, that's right.
Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebodys going to offer me some cantaloupe?
What're you looking at?
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
Hey what's that?
(sighs)
Right.
Ah--this is part of the problem!
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
Really....but I barely know you.
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
Oh, Great.
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
Are you sure?
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
What are you doing with this couch?
Really?
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
You going to do something about your sideburns?
Oh, yeah. I see him.
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
Uh, (sob) thanks.
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
You get out of here!
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
She died!
Really. Why?
Who wouldn't taste a pie?
I dont know.
Should I do it, George?
We're going out tomorrow night.
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
And he's has a bit of a rash.
Missing?
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
What's that?
I think it's OK.
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
Uh-huh...
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
Yeah. Okay.
That's a rat hat?
Thirty-seven.
Uh huh.
You speak Burmese?
You're father was blacklisted?
Hey!
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
(under her breath) Ya that'll happen)
(embarrassed, but smiling) Oh, your daughters.
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
Oh.
(Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
(quietly) No, no, no, I can cancel.
Yeah! It's a social thing.
How ya doin'?
Oh.
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
Yeah.
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
Everybody does. Bye-bye....
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
It's me.
What could I be saying?
Pardon?
(off camera) Huh.
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
Oh!
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
We're engaged?
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
(spoken to Testikov) that's a song
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
So you're giving him a discount too?
Cinnamon babka.
Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.
Double or nothing.
Oooh no, I don't think so.
Come on, don't be a baby.
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
(vicious) Fifteen thousand!!
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
Alright, I'm heading over right now.
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
Uh.. I?m Elaine!
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
Well we can take the car service from my office.
A bubble?
Find out what's going on!
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
I'm sorry.
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
Do you hear something?
Jerry!
get, um, started..
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
Siena?
Hey, have you seen Anna?
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
Yeah, nice to see you, too.
(shouts) I hate it!!
Hello
What butcher?
They're signing the papers next week.
What is that?
What?
Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
Don't worry, I...
You went to see her?
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
Oh.
This food was in the shower with you?
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
There's a feather in your cap.
No. We were both in the mood for one.
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
Um...as far as I know.
Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine)
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
(hopeful) Oh, you were?
What?
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
What?
I heard him contend that.
What?
Really? Can you really take a picture?
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
Why don't you just shut the f-
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
What?
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
What? What is this?
Uh, that's it.
It's black, right?
Well, who's gonna call?
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
When are you leaving?
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
He actually went to the hospital?
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
What did you say?
That will be fun.
Nope.
Oh, Mr. Peterman.
You look a little stressed.
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
(sits beside Jerry) What?
(laughs) Yeah, right, youre the master packer.
Interracial? Us?
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
For this couch?!
(To Jerry) You tell him.
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
"Top of the Muffin to you!"?
Hey.
(quietly) I can cancel.
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
What's to discuss?
You want one?
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
Wha--?
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
What?
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
Nooo.
Yep!
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)
A fur?
You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
(stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back.
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
Well, come on we're on vacation.
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
Bye Eeeen.
She was lost...
No.
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
I'm looking for Kramer.
Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.
Get a hold of yourself!
An Armani suit?
Yes it is.
You're way off.
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
Well...
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
Wha... W.. Are you going home?
Is that something?
Was it my fault?
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
So, we're going out Friday.
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.)
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
I got some for you.
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
You talked about a lot of things? Well...
Really?
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
Where are you going?
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
(horrified) Get together!!
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
Huh?
No, we just met...
No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
Why not? That's all I want.
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
Hey Boys-O!
What else?
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
Call an ambulance.
"Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's."
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
Sheets.
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
I'll see you later.
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
Ah, you don't have to tell me.
Well, there's a doctor right here.
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
Hi George.
Well, it's just a first draft!
I wouldn't sign one.
He's coming up?
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
hell-oo
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
Oh, that sounds... romantic.
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
Yeah? Well, I got news for you.
He's got it.
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) Mm-hm.
Now look, don't take too long.
(discouraged) Five days. Here.
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.
Jesus?
I think I can tell.
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
It could be very confusing.
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
Great. You?
Thank you very much.
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
I know.
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
Got to *love* the Drake!
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
did something happened?
In about twenty minutes.
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
Yeah, it's a bra.
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
Yeah yeah, ok.
That is it!
I am not your pal.
Ooh.
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
He dared....
It is obtrusive, isn't it?
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
Yea why not?
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
Can you let go of my tongue now?
So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
Why don't I give you my phone number?
It's not just hair! Look!
What's the matter?
It's me.
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
Hey.
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
Bore-ing.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
Hi! How 'r u doing?
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.
No.
What, you never said it?
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
Jerry...
This.
What, Uh oh?
. . . no.
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
what about it?
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
You're getting warm.
(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
Really.
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
Oh...
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
Why?
Call Kramer.
Okay.
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
Superman can go back in time?
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
Do I know him?
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
Portuguese?
What is the problem?
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
No!
If only.
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
When was this?
Hello? Vincent?
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
Hey.
(gasp) An accident? What happened?
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.
Oh! I forgot to tell you--
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
You oughta at least take a look at it.
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
Who are they?
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
What is with him?
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
I don't think so.
You know, uh...they're fake.
Oh my god.
Hi!
(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
I dont care, Im not hungry.
(Between laughs) Jugdish.
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
I don't think so.
I love Cajun cooking.
"Elaine, ya gotta have a baby." Ugh.
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
Noo!
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
Oh, okay.
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem.
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
What?
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
(dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him.
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
Yeah, you know, head to toe.
I told ya.
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
Sara Sitarides?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Just go.
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
I guess.
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
Well, it's just two hours by plane...
Hey George
No no no, they weren't here before.
It's just a stupid movie.
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
The balance beam?
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
Your crazy!
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
Not getting along?
(Suddenly angry) What?!
Get out!
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
Kramer!
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
It's that bad?
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?
George, please.
No!
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
Can I just have the name...
Right.
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
You're all grown up.
George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
You know, Kenny Rogers has a-
You're lucky I don't report you...
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?
What? Who told you that?
(sees racquet) Could I ...
John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
Yeah. It's surprising.
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
What do you care?
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
So you're concerned.
Really.
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
Where did that come from?
JERRY Hey
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
Ok.
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
I know.
And you're taking...
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
Yeah.
No. Today's *your* lucky day.
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
Hey.
Oh...(falls in to the sofa.)
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
Yeah.
What if.
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
Noo, thanks.
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
Mm hmm.
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
What, are you into this?
They drove away?
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
no no , ..
He collects (holds up magazine) these?
Yeah
Oh, I missed you!
No. What about him?
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
We're with him, we're with him.
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
Really?
Do you see it or don't you?
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
Yes, yes Mr. Mandel.
I do to.
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
I don't have a fax machine.
Waddya' write?
Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
How many?
Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.
Well, that is, that is strange.
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
Well! Well, it could be you.
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
You sure you don't mind?
Yeah.
Oh, mine's "Ike".
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
And scuba diving.
Newman plays tennis?
Mrs. Oliver?
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
So, you weren't born here?
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
Oh, hi Noel
I think they look good!
I did.
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
Why?
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
Oh, wasn't that terrible?
You think it's effeminate?
(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
I don't know.
Well... the counter...was right there, and...
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
Wha...?
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
You didnt.
I talked with the groom's parents..
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
Hey.
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
Hey! Wait up!
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
What is it?
Oh no, lets do it now.
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
It's the next best thing to being alone.
What?
Uh uh, you should go some time.
(big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.
"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
(on the buzzer) Buzz me.
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
Karate?
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.
Nah it's nothing.
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
Well that's not sex.
What?
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
So what do you want me to do?
We don't walk that fast...
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
Kramer, what are you doing here?
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
Well then what?
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
(gets Kramer's point) Hah.
Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
That's a good idea.
How is it talking?
Yeah.
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
All right.
Oh, me too.
Su-sie?
Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.
Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters.
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
But she was fifteen.
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
Oh, you'll be playing ...
Yeah.
You don't like her?
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
Got it.
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
Hi,
Certainly not.
No!
No, the Green Lantern.
Who did that? Who did that?!?
Anything else?
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
What shoving?!
Answering machine.
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
What?
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
Do adults ever order the child-size?
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
So? How was it?
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
There was a bit of an accident.
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
Yeah, that's right!
How'd you manage that.
(on intercom) It's Elaine.
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
What pool guy?
Hello, darling.
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
Uh, does it matter if it's melted?
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
Aah!
uh, ha.
I am?
But we need you.
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
What is it?
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
. . . shut up! (?)
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
Oh I didn't tell anyone.
No, No...
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
What? What did I do?
He used to be called Peter.
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
What did he say?
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
Yeah.
Jerry? Jerry!
Are you doing new material?
Yeah.
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
Oh, how's the baby?
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
There's no Big Salad.
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
(surprised) George!
Who?
Hem!! No reason.
Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
(hands them over) You can have 'em.
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
Cause then I could move in here.
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
Joey? Joey?
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
Oh, baby.
At the movies.
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Shall I undo it?
Me, either!
How old are you?
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
You would do that?
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!
It's not such a bad name.
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
Heh?
I got stuff to do.
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
Yeah.
No, I really don't want to.
Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
Oh no.
So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
Hi.
No, no, come on Michael!
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
I'm sure it's right around here.
Okey-dokey.
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
No, no, it does!
Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)
No, No...
What?, uh?
Artie Shaw. "Honeysuckle Jump." (The song ends.)
Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
Well at least let George do it!
You can't beat a babka.
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
Hey. What's going on?
Why?
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
I don't know.
What?
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
What for? Let's just get out of here.
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
Hey! George look at this.
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
What do you mean?
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
Ach, maybe.
Maybe it's the cold weather.
Ready.
Well what do you want to give him, change?
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
Mr. Peterman, um--
Mmm... (Elaine goes to the bathroom)
You're very special.
Why? Why d'you think he's upset?
No, he's not.
(pause) Man, Hands?
No! Jerry! Jerry!
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
Yeah.
What house guest?
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
He asked me out for Saturday night.
So, what's that?
I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
(Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
Yeah. Who sent you that one?
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
I hate the counter.
Really? You really missed me?
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
What did she say?
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
Hi.
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
I might be Elaine.
(Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.
Hey.
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
yeah me too
I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
Hi, Greg.
I'm gonna faint...
Makes you wonder, though, doesnt it?
What time you got?
What about this candelabra?
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
(shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God.
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
He went back.
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
Bye.
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
It's not bleak - it's springtime.
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
How was it?
Yes, he is dumb.
No problem.
No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)
You know, that button looks very familiar.
Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
Okay, c'mon it's movie time.
You been enjoying them?
Nah.
My back hurts.
I dont know.
Hellllllooooo.
What, how did you know that?
Yeah.
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
Both of the them.
You are!?!
So what happened?
Mm, love Farbman.
Oh, the guy with cancer?
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, whats happening with your apartment?
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
Definitely. Are you?
Thanks a lot.
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
Uhm, I just have a question.
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
We talked about that already.
Is he happy?
I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
Mulligatawny?
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
Ugh!
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
It's a hair.
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
Um, what does Nana sound like?
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
Who is he?
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
Desperado.
What?
Yeah, yeah, hello.
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
Yeah, it's all taken care of.
Hi.
I'm in looove!
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
Did he get it?
"Join the club."
Just me and George alone?
Come on!
Why cant you sit in the middle?
Ellis and Alex aren't even close.
(to another passenger) Huh. You believing this?
Whew that was a dozy.
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
Remember that Columbus book?
Yeah.
Oh, well, (pauses) Good night.
Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?
Thanks for the dinner.
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
Yeah, really great.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
Too bad.
Did you get a haircut?
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
Oh my God!
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
(shakes head) No.
I'm not even in here!
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
Her too.
You want to bet?
something.. wrong?
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
(to George) Ya see?
"Elaine got a new dress."
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
No, you look pale.
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
I think they went out to dinner.
Ten minutes.
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
What are you doing?
Hey George.
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Yes! 915!
Im kinda full.
David, um, I..
I would love to go upstairs.
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
What d'you think?
Jerry, He's A GUY!
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
It is not necessary.
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
Sigh/Ugh.
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
Jerry, my leg.
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
What, you think I should have?
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
George?
Ok, ok ok ...
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
Oh It must be my new organizer.
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
Oh, sure.
I guess it was just a matter of time.
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
I'm not in the mood.
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
(whispering to Jerry) Yes!
(Confused) What is wrong with this book?
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Ohhh, it's coming in already!
Ohhh! Golden Boy?
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Oh! The subway? From Queens?
Huh.
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
Where?
Yeah...Jake Jarmel.
(engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm.
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
Come in, come in.
Maybe coffee was coffee.
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
So, waddya' going to do?
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
Well, no point in wasting $1,200.
Right...
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
Awwwwww.
Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
I dont know what your parents did to you.
*No*, we would have heard it.
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
Which ones?
Well podiatrist.
Oh yeah? Can I see it?
Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.
Statute.
Now?!
What'd they say? What'd they say?
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
No, I don't want this anymore.
You can't! You can't do this now!
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
Ninety-nine percent sure?!
How do you feel?
Yeah. What do you do all day?
Sorry. Hello?
Fine.
(meekly) Yes ma'am.
Boogey?
(Getting up to leave) Alright.
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
A wedding.
I am up for anything.
..And then there were three.
Wall street.
Yes.
Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
Yeah, we're good friends.
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
He'd just be touching your back.
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
Uh, don't worry, he's cool.
Then why get the massage?
So what're you gonna do?
So what are we gonna get him?
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
7.0
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
So what?
What is this symbol?
I'd rather not say.
Oh, man. We're stopping?
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
What's going on?
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
Jerry, ... He's a GUY!
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
Nah! They're fake!
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
Uhh... no.
Well.
(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
I can't take your bedroom.
Ohh, I got your coffee.
unbridled enthusiasm...?
He didn't mention . . .
These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
Jerry!
(Recognizing him) Peter?
"Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those..."
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
I mean, stranger things have happened...
(Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?
(Sarcastically) Oh, that is really mature.
We know what a face consists of.
(making a face) "Moland"?
Jerry!
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
'Cause he gave me his.
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
What kind of maniac is this guy?
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
This is nice.
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
What about Georgie?
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
"Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye."
Told me what?!
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
I am? But that's so sick.
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)
But I, I can't go alone!
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
Will you turn around?
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
What the hell is this? Where are you?
Oh
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
It's garbage.
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?
So what did he say?
yeah.
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
Fine!
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
Well I, I don't know.
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
You never know...
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
Yes.
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
Forty bucks? Are they Sable?
We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
no it is not
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
Who else is on the show?
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
Yeah, Kramer, come on in.
Yeah, I called him Maestro.
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
I will never understand people.
(dumbfounded) No.
You said it was an emergency.
Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.
Delish. You know, short for delicious.
Im going to get some popcorn.
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
"Mrs. Onassis's"? That's hard to pronounce.
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
Hello.
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
Yes.
Are you OK? What? What?
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
Really!
Wait, what about your vomit streak?
Ring Dings?
How could you say something like that?!
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
I'm going to order Chinese Food.
What is that?
Yeah.
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
I like your little bag.
It shrinks?
Hey.
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
No Mister Peterman.
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
What are you talking about?
You know, it's not really that terrible.
Ah (hu ha - small laugh)
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
All right, pile it on.
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
(looks straight into his eyes) Jerry.
Yup, you mean him?
He's a musician.
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
Thank you, Julie.
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
(meek) Yes ma'am.
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
Where are they goin'?
Why?
So?
Ugghh.
I'm a "honey." He's pretty great, huh?
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
Dogs. Oh I love dogs.
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
Really? Grace?
Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)
(quietly) OK.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
Almost.
And what times the funeral?
Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?
So we're having dinner tonight?
He's sixty-six years old.
Ah, this really sticks in my craw.
How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
Oh Thanks, thank you very much.
Well, what do you want me to do?
No way.
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.
Hmm.
What?!
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
Uh...
Cookies?
ha ha well I know something about getting to first base. And I know you'll never be there.
You remember the date?
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
Kissing is not sex.
Yeass.
With the Chinese woman?!
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
She sent you a Christmas card?
Hmm. Sickies.
Yeah. That's right.
Do you have a...ketchup secret?
why does she have to chew so many?
Eat your soup!
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -
"I don't care"
What?!
"He thinks you're mentally challenged."
Good.
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
What're you getting?
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
What's his problem?
Colors.
Yeah. (sits down next to Susan)
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
No. A general guy.
Milk?
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
Oh is that so.
What?
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
No. You got the wrong number, kid.
Hear what?
You have a water bed?
So, you think you're sponge-worthy?
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
... date with Fred.
Hi, Michael!
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
Is that with the parts and labor?
I can't do that.
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
(right away) No. Second choice.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
Hmm. Tonight.
No, no.
And the bush-women.
Where are we going?
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
Yeah, I know.
(having trouble getting him to pay attention) So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
Uhmmm huh! Is it important.?
eh, Remember Roy, the artist?
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
"What are you talking about?"
Where did you get my chart?
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy, and he tells you he has to get up early, what does that mean?
The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
What?
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
What's wrong?
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
Nice looking family.
I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
So, what did he do?
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
I don't know, I guess.
Oh! Where are you going?
You ready?
I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
He is not a drug addict!
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
But, Jake, I didn't...
But he used a condom, right?
No. Why would you think that?
Enchante.
OKAY!!!
his face, did something happen to his face?
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
Where were you today?
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
It's a beautiful couch.
Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
Hi!
I'm sorry... sorry.
No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
Yeah, worked out good.
Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?
Good. Good. You?
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
(puzzled) You? What're you doing here?
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
(still in disbelief) You painted your face?
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
You still got that Fedex?
(weary) Okay.
Mr. Peterman, I, uh...
No, Castro.
No, it's not going to work with this guy.
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
Hey. Where's the car?
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
Oh! boy.
"Hey Jimmy!!"
That's it?
Mr. Peterman?
So?
Okay.
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
What is a bender anyhow?
No, thats too much money to borrow.
What's going on?
Can we rest here a second.
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
Paul?
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
I think so.
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
You wanna know what I said?
Noreen, are you crying?
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?
Did you get a thank you wave?
What?!
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
Why not?
I can't believe you left your post.
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
Uhh, so frustrating!
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
What?
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
See, yeah, that's all I was saying.
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
(feeling sick) Yeah! go ahead.
No, it could get sexual.
Why not?
(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
What...?
(turning to them, awkward) It's locked..
I'm not being superficial
See what?
Yeah. What is this all about
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
This is all very exciting.
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
No it isn't.
George I wasnt serious.
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
I don't want to keep him waiting...
Oops! (bumps into Levitan) 'Scuse me.
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
Ya!
I can't believe you said that.
uhn... Sorry!
Hi. (They kiss.)
Of Vincent's picks?
"Yeah!"
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
What, the one who just left?
I don't think so.
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
How do you do that?
Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
(To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
Great!
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
What kind of shopping?
Guess what I ate.
Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
This guy I'm seeing.
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic)
What's all this?
Ever.
Yeah, I'd like to place an order.
Judy .
Wow...
I thought you hated Los Angeles.
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
Mm-hmm.
Bye
(same time as Jerry) --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
Did you do with the dogs?
What are you doing?
You flew here coach.
Ellis.
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
They were?
Me too.
Where did you find it?
Oh, I love cashmere.
Come on, what is taking you so long?
I can be very clever.
Thanks.
Is she?
Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
Difficult?
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
So?
How can you possibly show your face there again?
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
Just give it back to him.
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
The roommate's.
What?
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
(sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
You left your door open.
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
Of course you do, it's an engagement party.
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
So, he's...
Yeah. It is kind of cool.
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
Why?
You know we were here, ahead of you.
What do I have to know?
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
No, I'm sure you do.
Jerry.
Hey guys...
(Blunt, to the point) No.
What? What are you trying to say, George?
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
(pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.
Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)
Yes! 212.
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
Can it cut that thin?
Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
Rarely.
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
Thank you. (gets up from her seat)
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
yes, (sob) I suppose,
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
Jon Voight? The actor?
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
That's the janitor closet, across the street.
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
Yeah, I think I might.
Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
What?
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
He can really do that?
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
"Do you wanna go or not?"
Are you actually considering this?
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
I'm sure he was just joking around.
Oh, hello.
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
You're not serious.
No, no, he's not my boyfriend.
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
I guess it's you, Jer.
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
laughing awkwardly Oh. Right. Good one.
Yeah...
What?
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
Yeah, that's too bad.
And the bathroom in your apartment?
Did you ever hear of...holding it in?
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
Good day.
Hey, what's going on?
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
That's the emergency?
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
Oh, yeah.
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
Huh?
Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
Yes, it's a must lie situation.
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.
You'll do well, you're smart.
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
Yeah, that's him.
(breathy) Bye.
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
So who's playing Elaine?
So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
Oh, I know the type.
Hello?
He told you about our conversation?
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
Do you want some of mine?
Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was, ah just, I don't know a little too...
How did you know?
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
Haven't you done enough to these people?
(pointing) Right here.
Here in this little apartment?
I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
Yeah.
What are you saying?
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)
Your guy can't cross to my side?
Hello?
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?
You could have.
Well come here and take a look.
Malaysia?
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
No.
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
No, these are saved.
No.
Can't you at least tell him what to do?
Jerry!
Yes.
Oh, he's fine.
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
No, that's not it!
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
(Shocked) Stabbed?!
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
What!?
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
Well, I, for one, really respect that.
These things happen.
What?
So, whatd she say?
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
This car.
What do you wanna know?
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
You're not still thinking about that are you?
Who's stopping you?
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
And... hes hilarious.
Nervous?
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
(English accent) Pardon?
Do you have twenty bucks?
Hello. (she enters)
You're a baby!
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
There, we just talked business.
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
The K Man did it!
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
Tomorrow .
(giggles)
You sure you want his face?
Hey, I didn't even use one.
Hi, Judy.
Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
No. She died.
Oh god.
[delightedly] Oh! You "pillage and plunder"?
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
Yeah, me too.
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
Mr. Pitt...
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
We, there are always a few.
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
You got the tickets right?
I am not buying a computer from you.
"I'm going to that!"
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
Take a guess.
How's it going'?
So he was bad. What d'you care?
Who Gendason?
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
[mind] This is getting awkward.
Isn't that a little racist?
Kramer, they're painted on!
Should you be smoking?
Great...
Bark.
What? What is so funny?
So, how did it end?
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
Come on.
Oh, you come on.
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
He can't go left.
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
Look, just because I'm a woman...
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
(Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite.
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.
You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
Mmm
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
Oh! (tries to take paper)
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
Whatever you want.
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
hey
No, but... it is very nice to know.
But why? Why don't you want to?
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
Hey. Is that your horse outside?
Well, that's because you're an idiot.
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
No, nothing.
I was with David *Putty* last night.
Dinner's good.
Right after ... that ...
(Confused by her reaction) You are?
What?!
All time.
What? What happened to the new Jerry?
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
Arghhh, look it's a fire! (cough)
So where do you wanna eat?
Oh.
I guess.
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
Aha ha ha (laugh)
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
You're crazy.
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
Five minutes? That's it?
What are you doing?
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
You never get good haircuts.
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
(gasp)
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
Yeah, no problem.
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
Well...
Aaahhhhh!!
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
Hi, Gail.
Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
He did.
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
Excuse me.
What is so funny?
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
Yes, he is lazy.
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
"Able Mentally Challenged Adults"
What?
Uh, great!
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
It must be a mistake.
(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
Why did you get a maid?
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Yeah, especially those frames.
Yeah, like a swoosh.
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
Yeah.
You took her medicine.
I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
Yeah...
(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
Yeah.
EZ Bake oven?
Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
Hi. (she flips her hair)
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
(improvising) I said, uh, some snuggly baby.
Oh-oh, but-
Dump her.
yeah, yeah
"What are you gettin'?"
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
I never saw the statue.
Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
You signed the release.
George?
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
Hey.
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
Yes! Grace!
Oh, you know what? He got engaged.
I guess.
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
(forcing a smile) Hi.
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
. Well this is all very flattering...
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
Yeah, see ya.
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
Oh ya.
Kramer, is that you?
Hey, I didn't get one either.
No, thats a big coincidence.
I can't believe what's going on out here.
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
Uh. Does he live underwater?
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
What?
Uh hu.
She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
"He's performing at this AMCA benefit."
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
What's the matter with you?
A *lot* of weight. (enthusiastically)
Oh, all right.
What is wrong with George?
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
Hi boys.
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
I just don't enjoy being with him.
Uh-huh.
He said hed give me a lift.
Hey, What are you doing out here?
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
I didn't say anything.
What'd you have?
Are you calling me a liar?
Oh, all right.
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
What is a wig master?
Oh.
.....Hi.
Wow.
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!
I don't know.
All right, we're done here.
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?
I beg to differ.
Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.
What?
Well eh, kind of....
*Get* *out*!
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
Thank you. Ow!
Do you need anything?
(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.
How did you do that?
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
You have a little thing for this fella'?
Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)
(shouts) HEY!!
I didn't know you were getting me a note.
Whatever.
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
Because... Yeah?
Oh, see, this is the problem.
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
Have you seen the card?
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
Hello.
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
Will you just park it already?
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
Vivian...
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
So when are we gonna eat?
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
What?
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
I had the roast beef
So this is never gonna stop?
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
We have to replace the couch.
I don't want to see her naked.
Oh, very nice.
Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer!
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
What? I can't hear you.
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
Hi
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
(angry shout) Kramer!
Yeah it is nice actually.
Arrive?
Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
I can't. I'm the best man.
See what is that? Is that a date?
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
Thanks
Hi!
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
Nana?
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
Uh-huh.
Where's Karen?
It.
What?
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
Is there a table ready?
Eight-fifty.
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
Hey, what if he's married?
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
What?
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
Balloon bouquet? For who?
(Between laughs) What is that?!
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
Oh, Maestro.
Yeah I am still holding.
Well, she wants you to like her.
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
Yeah.
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
Is that tomorrow?
My roommate has Lyme disease.
There's Rachel.
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
Who is it?
What about the dogs?
Justin Pitt?
I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
Huh?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
Oh, yeah.
(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
How can I do that?
During Schindler's List?
Oh uh uh...
Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
What is that?
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!
You've never felt remorse.
Aaalright!
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
Mr. Lippman, how are you?
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
Yeah.
Oh, hi.
The CABIN is on fire!
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
Katra?
[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
Do you go in the shower?
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
What?
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
Is this gonna hurt?
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
Where's my water?
Oh. Uhhh...
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
(shouts) Oh, go to hell!!
What did you have to say that for?
Alright, alright.
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
George! It's cheating.
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
Yup. You?
(accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you.
Wanna sit down?
Dick was fired.
But, that didn't happen to you.
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
What? No good?
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know...
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
Yeah, what?
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
I dropped a grape.
(pointing at the shoes) "What are those?"
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
Ah.
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
You can't ask a person to change their name.
I realize that.
It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
That was so good.
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
Search... for Spock?!
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
It was a joke...
You want it?
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
Oh, lovely.
Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.
No.
Okay, (to Jerry) Move along. . .
Youre getting what?
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
Oh, great. Send him in.
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
Congratulations.
What? Why?
Some dinner, huh?
It took him like ten seconds!
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
Right
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
Just a hunch.
What?
Well, what is it?
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
Um. Kramer!
(dismissive) Gene's trash.
Hmm. I never take them.
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
Are the clubs there?
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
Yeah.
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.
I mean, I can't give people orders!
Yeah, I am.
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
No, no, I'll be back.
Oh, all right, James. He he he
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
Oh! Do tell sir?
What meeting?
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
I dont think so David, were through.
Yep! just you and Kramer.
Yeah.
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
Hey!
uh huh (very quietly)
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?
Three notes?
Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
Watch out for that maroon Golf.
Hi Peggy.
So now Duncan is back?
Well maybe you should call him.
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
Hey, how we doin' on time?
What?
No, that'd be too noisy.
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
Hey, I did it.
I am speechless. I am without speech.
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
(sighing) Again?
What do you mean?
(sighs) So how about that Aaron?
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
No, I don't.
Six hundred and twenty million people died.
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
It smells like a rubber fire.
My god, George!
Yeah.
It isn't?
But you said no more painting.
Elaine Benes?
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
What is that?
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
I gave him an ultimatum.
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
Very nice meeting you!
I thought you were hungry.
Its disgusting.
Who's that?
Is it *real* butter?
Oh..Nice to meet you.
Oh, the date. The date.
You don't know?
(unsure) Oh-kay.
Of course I hear that.
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
Hey!
Maybe we could all have dinner later?
Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
Why? What happens if you don't order right?
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
Good workout?
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...
Hey, Arnie's just as upset.
That's impossible...
I thought she was the one.
Hu hu, ha ha ha.
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
What, what is it?
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
What? No, its not a big deal.
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
Well stop being such a baby.
and here.
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
Yes?
Yeah, right.
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
(looks at it) TV Guide?
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
I got a note from my gynecologist.
Oh no.
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?
Well I figured that's what couples do.
(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
Chicken wing shoulder blades.
Alright, Im out of here.
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
Oh, I'm sorry.
AH! I've got it.
Whoa. What is the matter?
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
Tell me!
all right then, where is it??
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
It looks exactly like me.
Hey.
So, the only reason ...
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
Was that Tim Whatley?
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
Dad thinks George is gay.
Alright, there's no---
Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
Oh. No, we're not--
Oh it was such a great night.
... and biking and ..
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
Get it out!
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
Dam
Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me.
Oh, no, it's okay.
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
Did he give you a reason?
Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...
George, do you realize that Rava has asked me to edit her book?
Hi.
Ah.
(determined) Eleven thousand!
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
She said you're getting together Saturday night!
What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
At Yankee Stadium?
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
Hey. Hey everybody.
Exactly.
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
Hello!
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
Yeah, the address is 78th West...
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
Where are you going?
(not convinced) Ech.
Mr Lippman?
Okay.
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
No, sir, I can't.
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
Just imports? No exports?
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
Uh
I said it.
Oh no, thank you.
(picking up) Jerry!
Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)
Pliers?
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
Jer, do you see where this is going?
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...
I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.
(giggling) Oh.
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
Must have been an accident...
No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
What? A health plan?
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
Because they're turning your teeth green?
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
I think I'll let you do it.
You are amazing.
Get movin'...
But I got my own note.
Vanessa.
Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
Actually I thought he was very professional.
Kramer, you're hurting me!
Mm! To get what?
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
A what?
Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)
Why?
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
Hey
Um uh.
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
I have no chance, do I?
It.
Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?
"your shirt was out?"
I said I'll take care of it!
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
Albano is your last name.
Kramer?
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
No, no.
Right! In fact... No, never mind...
Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
Ahhhhhh haa ha ha
It's your house.
Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
Now what was that?
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
Yeah, I could use a chuckle.
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
(laughing).
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
We'll see.
Hi!.
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
(sitting down in the booth) 'Kay.
Very funny. That's very funny.
Did you tell him it was peed on?
Egh, Jake Jarmel?
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
But you didn't say anything. Ohhh
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
Hi!
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
(to the black waitress) Long day?
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
Oh, hi honey.
Ugh! You are kidding me.
Five minutes.
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
The mannequin!
Hey.
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
So?
What soup place?
That was nothing.
No.
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
They all are.
Oh thats nothing. Um and anyway um
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
She.. was.
But he's okay?
No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
Books, Jerry.
Bye.
Hey, where's Kramer?
Ah, I know. I know...!
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
Go.
Oh my God.
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
Who's faking?
Well it did occur to me.
Cosmo, Cosmo?
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
You found out Kramer's first name?
(quietly) Ok.
(shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?
(like a little girl) Okay...
What are you doing?
Ask Jerry.
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
(setting down her glass) Oh, ya haha.
Showering?
So was Mia Farrow there?
So the trip was good?
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
This is Aaron.
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
I know!
Wow, invitations again...
Why are they doing this?
Downtown New York?
My leg looks pretty bad.
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
I gotta go talk to him.
Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
Oh, sure.
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
Hey!
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
Where you going?
Mmm!
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
So what?
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
That's a pretty girl.
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
You know, George, that's an onion.
Do you want something to read?
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
Who?
Oh, see you tomorrow morning.
Your old high school hangout? Why?
That's ridiculous.
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.
KRAMER!
I, I don't think so.
You see? Again.
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
(emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs)
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
So?
We were just trying to help.
Thank you very much.
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
What?
(exhales) They're going to be heroes.
Fine, go away.
Hey.
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
What tell? What's a tell?
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
Get in there!
W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
Why do you have a bug guy?
And he's dunking!
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
Alright.
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
Don't be ridiculous.
You know you're chippin' in.
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
That's not gonna do anything.
Yeah, so they say.
[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
they-they took it from Tolstoy.
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
Yeah?
What? You never told me that.
Oh.
(positive) Oh! (little chuckle)
THIS is what you came up with?
Well I trust people not to do that.
Well what, what about your fact-checking job?
Okay...Good day..
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
Yeah, yeah he is. (as she leaves)
One million.
So you know , ... he called me.
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!
Oh, you have to say something.
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
How can I go?
Kramer has a record.
All right, see you later.
Yeah.
Night.
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
(to George) I'm gettin' his mail.
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
Ohh!
Why does he do that?
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
Like... (doing it) Like this?
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
Ooh!
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
There's some kasha.
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
Ok.
What do you do?
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
What is your answer to number 74?
(uh-oh) Her?
Hi.
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
Seattle.
It's almost stupid if we didn't.
All right. I'm going I'm going
What happened? What took you so long?
Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?
I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
Did you see that?
Been a while?
Hi.
I got a date.
You're still here. You're a dynamo.
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
E-an
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
So? What happened?
Get out!
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
Who's Kristin?
Whats the rent?
Well maybe I feel the same way.
Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
I don't know, maybe.
You weasels!
What are you guys doing here?
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
Ahh.
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
Yeah. See that--
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?
Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys.
Yeah.
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
You didn't bring a brown sweater.
Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
(Smiling, proud) I said, "yeah."
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
Today?!
(worried) What? What?
"I do now."
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
Jerry.
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
Because! Because she missed her period!
I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
Oh.
Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
Pardon me?
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
They're um, Botticelli's.
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
I know, it's just something you have to say...
Can I fix that after lunch sir?
I gotta go return something...
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
"AAaaaaahhh! Really?"(giggles)
Wait up!
Those school zones are a killer.
I've always loved ... United Airlines.
A seemingly infinite supply.
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
what is it?
What do I need this for?
What the hell does that mean?
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
Hellllloo.
Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.
Some friend of his from England.
(looking for support) Jerry!
Where's Jerry?
I don't think so.
You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
He did the move.
No no - me first.
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?
Hi!
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
What if a handicapped person needs it?
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
(she fakes a strangling) RRR...
Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
I *loooove* horse manure.
I'm not Jewish.
I was on the other line talking to Jill.
Nice to see..
Congratulations! You passed!
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
Ahh-cnee.
Hello.... hello, oh...
No, I just..
Someone I know!
To please Mr. Pitt.
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
Those are JFK's golf clubs!
Hi.
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
I just met him this morning.
Oh, well I have to eat.
I am?
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
News? What news?
Hello. Jerry's not here?
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
Ah, . . .
Gimme ten bucks and find out...
Mm. This food is fantastic.
I can't believe you ski!
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
Did anyone call?
Why?
What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
Its OK. (starts walking down the hallway)
I think he's got ideas.
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
No, who?
(Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
Hello?
(very reluctant) Okay.
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
What smell?
Hey.
Where would I take the test?
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
Elaine.
I knew it! You're a regifter!
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
Ah.
(To George) Stay away from her.
That's because I thought you were black.
Okay.
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
What?
But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
We should be able to get across right through here!
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
You think we're far enough.
"Ughhhh"
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
Shhhhhh!!!
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
No.
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
OK. I dont quite know
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
George! [waves hi]
"Why?"
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
(sniffing) Dandruff?
Run down your case for me again...?
But you lied first.
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
Peach.
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
Why? Because I can?
What are you doin' there?
Have you ever thought about it?
(disappointed) Oh.
Hi! This is my friend George.
Well, Here we are.
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
No.
Vegetable Lasagna!
(looking guiltier) No, nono.
This is an absolute disaster.
Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
Oh, GREAT!
Thank-you.
You can pick 'em up right now.
Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.
Green Lantern.
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
I didn't take your napkins.
Ah hah.
Do, do you?
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
And I said I hadn't seen her.
They took Babu away?!
How could this have happened?
Yeah that! So, . . .
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.
So?
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
Jinx buy me a coke.
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
It's me!
I still don't see what the big deal is.
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
Im not so sure he wants one.
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
I don't know. It's a building.
I do.
I dunno.
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
(neutral) Okay.
So what?
Oh, no...that won't last.
Yes. Who it this?
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
He is a Maestro.
(Interested) Oh?
What did you do?
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
So what?
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
No, I'm not. Here you go.
yeah, all right ok
Why?
No.
Why?
Oh, I dont know..
Theyre dying in the nets.
Why are you talking about my shoes?
Listen, Jerry can you do me a favor? (clears throat) Could you, go into the room with me to visit him because ah, I don't want him to think that I'm, y'know... interested.
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
Or you.
No, Chinese.
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
A little.
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
Oh. My ballet tickets.
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
My God, are you okay?
Yeah, obviously.
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
So what?
That is so stupid.
Pardon?
(surprise) Hey, what're you guys doing here?
Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.
Jerry, do I stink?
No no, no no.
Okay. We ready to go?
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
Well, relationships are very important to me.
Hi!
Oh. So, you're pretty religious?
Fine! Were through!
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
Well maybe you should ask him!
Uh-huh.
No, No....Yesss!!!!!!
What am I gonna say?
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
So they don't want a baby?
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
How do you even know the jacket is there?
Kicked out?! Why?!
Oh, my god.
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
Yeah! You're probably right.
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
How could that be the dog?
Oh...nuts.
Aren't you too young to be bitter?
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
Ok,
That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
Whar about Kramer?
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
Interesting.
Jerry, you can barbecue back here.
I...I don't know...
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?
Later!
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
(scoffs) Uh, is Noreen there?
Yeah, Yeah!!
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
Oh, sure.
Yeah, so?
(stretching) Oh Man... Uunh.
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
I don't know about that.
You want the money for the big salad, George?
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
(warning) George.
No, no, no. You give me your number.
I thought he was with you.
No, because I slept with my back to him.
Theyre very clean animals.
I think it's B.O.!
How do you know?
(Agreeing) Mm.
(mouths silently) That's perfect!
(To Anna) Get in the car.
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
(Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.
Well I'm going to hell.
(smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon.
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
Fine.
Because it's really nobody's business.
So what did you say?
Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
You're right Maestro.
Dial 9- MERLIN.
Have a good game.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.
What is this?
What are you doing? What is all this?
You're nuts!
You're a taking person.
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
What did who say?
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
 Hi! How are you?
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
(shouting up) Jerry! Jerry!
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
Hi, I'm Elaine.
Kramer, forget it.
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
C'mon.
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
You never said you were fighting children.
(pushes him) You doofus!
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
Yeah.
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
(dryly) Yeah, too bad.
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
It,s, it's up to you.
Who's he?
(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
Ahh, yeah, sure.
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
I know.
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
George?
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
Oh, hi Fred.
(to Jerry) Five more days?
I didn't pay attention.
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
No, no, I'm leaving.
Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
When did you tell George to be here?
You mean in a real Fight Fight?
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
The Soup Nazi!
Yeah, you *could*...
Alrighty, bye.
Hey, "great" organizer you gave me.
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
After one date!
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
Uuhhh.
Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned
No, I'm still working on it.
I don't know.
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
Well I have to interview a Mohel.
Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)
How's that gonna happen?
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
Because it's rude, otherwise.
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
What's that?
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
What's with the claw?
Of course.
Yeah, yeah, thanks.
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
What was that?
You? I'm more responsible than you are!
Correct.
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
Yeah? Well, so am I!
Keep following him.
Brett?
Ohh, what is the point?
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
The Drakette took it.
Yeah, yeah, that too.
She stopped performing.
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
Hello.
No! I won't be a party to this.
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
Ooh, it's a cake walk.
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
New couch? Why?
(to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.
Aren't you Raquel Welch?
You are kidding.
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
Hello.
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
Hi (?). Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!
What?
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?
Uh, this is,
(impatient) Come on!
What would you wear?
Reggies? I can't eat anything there.
What?
Nice to meet you, too!
Can he fix it?
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
Kramer, it's...
Do I know anyone??
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.
She's Cynthia!
Oh. Have you been out?
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
So you say.
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
Well they're perfectly edible.
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
Really?
Well, he's not a baseball player.
What? Wheren't they just here?
You were big.
Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
Yeah.
No one.
Are you out of your mind?!
Yeah. I know. Me, too.
Alright thats it! Were back together!
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
What is the big deal!!
Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
Uh huh...
Unless youre married to a dictator.
But I really enjoy dancing.
(quiet) Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.
I dance fine.
All right, let's just forget it.
My manuscript?
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
I needed to move a bureau.
What statue?
What about the party? What about the Drake?
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
Well, he looks like a man.
(Nodding) The other guy.
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
Yeah.
Thank you.
No, no, unfocus.
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
Hi/Hey.
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
People go to South America.
As long as you don't put...
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
Tuna?
What is this?
Kramer?
'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
What do you mean bald?
Oh, take 'em.
(Let down) He didn't show.
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
You really think he wants the bike?
I've got to go
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
Hmm... No you don't.
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
No.
I'm plumb out.
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
Oh, it stinks.
Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
It is..
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
Yeah, so?
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition.
Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
They don't know anybody in Chicago.
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
Well...Poppie. I think differently.
Come on. Let me see it.
Well if it's not a date then what is it?
think Tony, think
Nope.
Yeah.
Kramer!!
Well...
See you later.
Get out!
Twenty-five percent.
What is the matter?
(awed) Oh, look at this!
I hate the good ones.
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
They want five thousand dollars now.
Oh, nothin'.
He's got a back problem.
Do you mean "reer?"
Right, well...
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
Oh, yeah. What's that called?
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
Hi Jerry!
(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
It's nothing.
Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...
Mm-hmm.
Hey, it's me.
Where's Beth?
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
Yeah, yeah, right.
Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
(Casually playing along) So what?
Uh huh.
You can't let him get away with that!
Hey Todd.
(worry) Oh no. What?
You know that guy downstairs?
So what are their plans?
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
Who is it?
Where did you get her?
Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.
What don't you know?
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
He tells him which soap to use.
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
Well, have they called the police yet?
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
Can we do this later, George?
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
Burma.
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
Look out the window, you'll see.
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
Ye.
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
Ohh...
except for Jerry!(laughs)
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
(nit) It's Susie.
So, I understand youre moving to Phoenix?
Set.
I'm going down there.
Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
It's Elaine.
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
(laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
Yeah.
That seems about right.
Just gimme your keys.
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
Oh, hi.
Why?
No.
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
Alright, that's enough of this.
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
Just in those commercials.
Alright, gimme the phone... it's my "thing"...
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
Dave, um, painted his face.
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
He took it out.
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
What are you doing here?
Yeah
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
this isn't a very good time George
George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
Wrong side?
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
How kind of you.
Yeah.
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
(ingratiatingly) They should be here today.
Mmm.
Ohhh!
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
Hum, he's such a great guy. You should meet him. You know he's the one who got that hit
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
Uh... sure/yeah..
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
What do they do?
Wow!
Oh, go down and get them.
Isn't that blue car him?
I think she'd figure it out.
It's a classic.
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
Uh, Kramer...
Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
What about a bad gasket?
Jerry's a nazi?!
Ah, well.
Oh that's a nice store.
What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
So, thats why were not together anymore.
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
Yes! I'm a writer.
No!
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
The look you just gave me.
I bet your parents were upset, huh?
Kramer.
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...
hates it
Copywriter.
Oh, that's insane.
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
I'll say.
Yup.
C'mon..
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
Good.
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
Right.
Bye.
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
He did.
Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
(surprised) Brett? Everything alright?
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
Why are you yelling at the TV?
What? What?...
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
You don't need us.
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
I think he does too
What?
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
So where do you get this note?
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
But it's cold out.
Huh. (muttering) This should be interesting.
All right.
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
What?
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
I kinda like her.
I'm so sorry George
What?
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
Yes.
Oh she's fat?
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
Get off of me!!
(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
No, wait!
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
George!
All right. I'll be back.
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
Ooooh, please.
Huh. All right. Come on.
hi
What? Clinging to some scraps?
Oh!
Hi.
I staked out his health club.
What d'you mean?
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.
Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder.
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
What else have you got?
They rehearse all the time?
What is that stain [on my coat]?
Excuse me.
Sweater.
Hello.
Well, uhm... I...
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
Really? When?
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
What's the matter with him?
Are you?
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
Do you think it's a coincidence?
At work?
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
It ever happened! Understand?
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
He wrote a song about it!
Why are you so concerned about this?
So you consider this a relationship?
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
(sneezes)
Oh, uh, I didn't know.
Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
OK I'll see you later.
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
hi, nice to meet you finally
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
You sure?
I think you're sticking it to me.
here, take it
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
Oy vey!
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
Ooohh.
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
So did you hear this message?
George, I just don't want you interfering.
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
It can be very frustrating.
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
What?
Aawwh Please.....
You're not going to do any walking.
What
(interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry!
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
We're down here! Help!
Well what happened when you raced him again?
(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
Hmm! Rico!
I got what you asked.
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
Hello?
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
"I know that but why are you going?"
I need those clubs.
Peter Jennings had one?
(Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.
No, hes driving back to Maryland tonight.
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
[gives up] Yeah, exactly...
With the car!
Why?
What IQ test?
Where did you get all these pictures?
When do you take this exam?
Really? What're the other titles?
What?
Good-bye
What?
Faking what?
What did you do that for?
I like coffee.
Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.
So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
Why should I tell you?
Okay, this is quite a place.
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
Hey, what are you doing?
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
Hi.
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
Really?
South Africa.
C'mon
When's Rachel comin' out?
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!
What?
It's BOOKED Jerry!
The dingo ate your baby!
Well if you want it, you get it.
I gotta go. (Hangs up.)
I wonder what happened?
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
That's good...
Hey.
But...Jake...
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
He does, how'd you know that?
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
And vodka.
Have you thought about an intervention?
Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
What do you mean, like laundry?
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
(sarcastically, to George) Stay!
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
(entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
I need some space.
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
Fusilli Jerry?
Hi!
Ha hum...Do you like George?
Bye bye
Yes, yes.
(grudging) Alright.
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
Yeah.
Youre pregnant.
Hi.
It's me.
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
But she broke up with you.
What are you doing? What is that?
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
Forty-seven.
Oh, cristal clear!
Mmm, this is delicious.
Real good!
Really?
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
Huh . So What's it about?
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
No.
Jerry, give him the keys back.
(to Kramer) He took it out.
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
(flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice.
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
Uh, man!
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
Well, go, go.
Yeah.
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
Nothing, and I've looked.
Any other time.
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. Thats hard to get used to when youre in so many other fast ones.
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
What call?
Between a peck and a make out.
"Oh yeah! Jimmy."
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
That's just because your a jackass.
Well, I'm dating a communist.
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
He sat in mud. Not you.
Hide!
(SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
Hello, Jerry.
It's for George.
You gotta do me a favor.
Jerry, I've always loved ..u..
Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!
Even though what?
Me?
(to George) Hey.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
What?
James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!
I am an associate.
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
Hello.
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
Things occur to me from time to time.
It's us.
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
Ill see ya. (Hanging up the phone)
Yeah
All right. He kissed me. Okay?
What about George?
Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
You.
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
(quietly) Give that to me.
O.K. You start. What's your first choice?
Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
... hiking ...
Yeah. You're right.
Good for you.
So, that's the situation.
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
(animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends.
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
Yeah, he did.
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
Yeah, who speaks Korean?
What?
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
She's not Chinese?
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
Really!?
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
I know.
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
You have no idea.
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
Oh c'mon, Newman.
Theyre coming in?
So, will I see you later tonight?
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
So, where's Todd?
Oh my god..
(Flattered) Mr. Pitt...
Well, did he say that?
You can't tell me?
Why dont you just ask her parents?
Correct. (catches herself) What's that?
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
Nuthin'. Then he took me home.
Yeah, how's the doctor date?
Oh, boy, I'm really scared!
(laughs)
Jerry, look at my fish.
No, he wants to torture me.
Yeah, she was an editor.
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
Yes.
Okay.
I'll have a cinnamon babka.
You know, we should say something.
We're straightening out?
Roy!
Oh, you want one?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
You mean lying to your uncle?
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
Well, how are we gonna do it?
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
No.
(Between chuckles) How is she?
If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
I really think it's the size of your neck.
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
So what are you going to do?
How much did you pay for them?
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
Hi.
Mmmm.
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
(looking at Jerry) Ohh.
Ah, no.
She won't even give you a hint?
Yeah!
Get out! What'd you do?
[momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small?
(accepting) Okay, okay.
He's good.
Oh yeah, the curse toast.
What?!
This chicken is really good.
What?
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
Uh, it was in the Hamptons.
Are you alright?
You did enough.
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
Ah! Ah!ah!
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.
Me?
Where are you going?
Hey!
What's wrong with him?
We know the terrain.
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
What?
She did? Oh, that's so great!
No no, I wanna go.
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
Steve.
Wow, this is soft suede.
You know Sue Ellen Mishke?
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
Yeah, me too.
He told you about . . .
Nothing, nothing.
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited.
"Well.... (pointing at him) Jimmy!"
Really?
Hi George. Hi Jimmy.
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
Hey, what time is it?
Peterman is gonna kill me.
Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
Yeah, you can get a gardener.
Why?
uh.
(Correcting herself) Maestro!
Yeah, Art Vandelay.
We do what we can.
Uh huh.
Shove it!
No, no, it's okay.
Jerry, I'm on the other line.
What?
(laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
Is George here?
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
Really?
It's supposed to feel good.
Yeah? What was it?
What? Well, who's gonna do it?
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
Yes, she's a dermatologist.
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?
Yes it is level jumping.
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
Is that the right word?
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
No, I guess you couldn't have..
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
Hey, is that real fur?
Hey.
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
Right. Go right!/South!
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
(dread) No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
Say what? (laughing) Say what?
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
I know, he's so tiny!
Uh-m, uh I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we are going to the, Poconos on Friday, right honey? (pointing to Jerrythe boyfriend?)
No. Stay! Stay. Stay.
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
I don't know.
What about his comedy act?
(wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!
Yeah. That's him.
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
Hey, what do you think?
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
Yeah.
(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
Boy, he takes such a long time.
Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
Then how did you find the place?
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
Oh, that's not too expensive.
See'ya.
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
At least it wasn't atomic.
We'll have to sleep head to toe.
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.
(MUMBLES) That's just about enough
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
Hey.
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?
Why do you keep watching?
Where's Lois?
What, Ocean.
I know, it's not that.
Im not moving in.
What did he do about it?
You told them that?
What? Why not?
(enters) Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.
(encouraging) Dont forget.
What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
Sssshhhhhh!!!
What are you doing with your old couch?
Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
(pointedly) Okay. Fine.
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
Well do you see it or don't you?
Oh.
Alright, let's go, come on.
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
Huh?
(Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.
Could you put it in a big bowl?
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.
No, I got caught.
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
Why?
Yeah.
Ah.
Id better not.
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
Hey. Hi Maestro.
Here's a thought - Bye bye.
Okay... bathroom....kitchen.
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
(sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo.
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
What's wrong?
Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
Ya, Yes we will!
Yeah.
But it's Saturday.
Yep.
Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.
Ill take it!
You should show this to Georgie.
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
Bravo!
Him? Him who?
No, but that's one problem. Why?
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
If I was saying something I would have said it.
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
Ohh... its snowing. Its beautiful.
Ill be right back.
See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages and plunders! I'm so lucky.
Why?
(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
(Quick) What situation? I have a situation?
Hello
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
Then why didn't you take it?
Well, uh, I'll cancel it.
Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
would you throw this trash out (closes the door)
Bye.
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
This, that, and the other.
"War-- What is it good for?"!
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
Anybody here? Peterboy?
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
Hi, I'm Elaine.
Oh!
But why? Why can't you do it?
[Proudly] Really?
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
I tought you didn't like double dates.
Yeah.
Hi.
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
What?
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
Yeah, you want five?
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
No, not at all...
Im doing great.
Yeah.
I don't blame ya'
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
I don't know.
(at the same time) Yes, yes.
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
Worked?
Excuse me.
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
How do you know his name?
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
Grace?
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
Swan Lake, at the Met.
What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
So, what d'you think?
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
Who is it?
I'm white.
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?
Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
No, no no.
It's the play button, off his VCR.
Hello?
Exactly.
I don't buy it.
Oh! my God.
because of the gum
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
What?
(Accepting) Alright.
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
Some night, huh?
Maybe I should just get married.
Ah nuts!
You haven't told them yet, have you?
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
Okay.
Oh my God. You're crying.
Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.
yeah ha ha ha
Which one is he?
Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
Huh! Sexy?
OK.
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
Because you have an attitude.
(Giving up too easy) Okay.
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
AHhh. Thank you.
I know.
Na.
No. Your. (breathes)
And then he starts writing on my chart.
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
Really?
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
What?
Let me test-taste that. (tastes Jerry's yogurt)
Why? Why were you so embarrassed?
So you don't know anything?
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
Faster.
(laughing) No thanks.
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
Mmm, gyro.
Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
(backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww...
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
Oh! The Risotto broad.
And you get along well with women.
He's guarding a suit?
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
All right. Take it easy.
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
Yeah
Where's my drink?
Oh, hi Dan.
Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
Oh, he's not on drugs.
Right there.
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
Just some?
Hey, did you get a massage yet?
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
I don,t think so.
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
It's invisible.
I can't tell you.
A cookie!
It's Elaine.
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
You didn't say this to George, did you?
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
Kramer
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
Really?
Isn't it going the other way?
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
Stunned by soup?
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
Yes it is.
What's the name of this physical therapist?
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
Hello, Frank.
He told you all that? How could he?
Hi.
Uh, it's a riot Alice.
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
Joel...
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
I Like Her!
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
(Shrugging it off) Oh, please.
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
Yeah..Yeah...
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
Right.
(head in arms) I know--
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
Yeah.
Mmm... phenomenal peas.
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
Jerry!
Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
Yes, exactly.
I like feet too. Im just saying
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
Uuh.
I don't know if I can.
You asked me to.
Oh, hi, Dad.
I see.
Oh, gimme a break!
Hi.
Winona is a Native American.
Saturday.
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
Okay.
"Yeah! Mel Torm, That's his nickname."
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
No thanks!
What is wrong with everybody?
My pleasure.
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
Yeah, I'll take it.
I'm afraid of dogs now.
Tim.
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
Really?
All right and that just about... does it.
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
Yeah, I suppose.
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
Kramer, what's wrong?
Just, very interesting.
What guy?
You don't have the label maker, do you?
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
Out, damn heal!
Consomm, hmm.
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) whats happening with your apartment?
All I've got is grape juice.
Me too
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
Oh. Ok. Thank you.
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
Jerry no, that's important to me.
Goodbye.
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
How did you get that job?
No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
Hello.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke!
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
How bout a Big Salad?
(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
Oh.
You don't like them?
(shocked) Oh my God.
Get out of here! Why?
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Are you
Ah hahaha hhuu ha (flirty laughing)
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
You're welcome.
We've got a good team.
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
All shell think is that you like her.
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
You don't have an old pair?
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
What are you gonna do down there?
Jerry, are you free on Friday?
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
No. I don't want him looking.
Its killing you isn?t it?
No thanks.
Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff.
It's Joe Mayo's coat.
No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
Hey.
Like clams.
(Sincere) I'm sorry.
(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
No. Me neither.
Well, I --
Oh man, hes nuts.
I've got Super Bowl fever.
There's nobody I can go with.
Good working with you.
No, don't...
Her type? What type?
What?
Really, like when?
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
You know, I'm going as a beard.
What the--
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
So? Then what?
Want to go get something to eat?
What's that?
Just read it!
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
Theres no Rubber Man.
He's on with a Chinese woman.
No.
Aha.
I didn't know you SMOKED.
Well some people drink coffee that late.
All right, what time do you want me back here.
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
(off-camera) It's Lainey!
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
(to George) Are you happy now?
(Through intercom) It's Elaine.
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
Twisted? God, I did you a favor.
It was an accident.
Cocktail flu.
(to Mrs Allister) Janitor's meeting.
What?
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
Great... [To herself] Help me...
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
What is it?
What black guy?
Get that out of my face.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
Wow!
Party of four? Who are we meeting?
I don't want it.
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
Yeah? So?
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
What does that mean?
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
How are you gonna widen the lanes?
Someone I know.
The flight's been canceled?!?!
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
Yeah, I'm on the phone here.
Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
Oh, probably caught in traffic.
Yeah.
Do you pick it up?
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
New jeans?
Where is the ambulance?!
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
You should run for mayor.
Man, Kramer! I could kill him!
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.
Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know.
Yeah, she'll be here any second.
Alright, well, now that's something..
Yeah, they don't know.
Well, I am the President.
Very near.
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
Maybe.
Wha'd you get on your SAT's?
Uh huh.
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
Pocketbook or a handbag?
Yeah, talked earlier.
I can't do it.
Huh.
Why do you need the name? You already have the address.
What are you, yellow?
I think it's a mistake.
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
Really?
What? No, no, I'd rather...
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
No, no.
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
No its not. That really is true.
(Looking up from a menu) Yeah.
yeah.
They have big salads.
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
I know, but he does.
But I really did like it
Good! I won't!
Yeah. That's what I just said.
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
No,
Me either.
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
Sorry. Somebody...help us!
Jeannie... your fiancee.
Who? Who is Ramon?
It's a long story.
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
What?
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
Jerry, the man is a doctor.
Oh, hi Greg.
Oh, I know! It is awful!
Better call the zoo.
Correct.
Wh..?
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
Yeah, who's he?
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
Can you believe him?
The pygmy pullover.
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
This is what people do.
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
It's brug-wa (?).
What?
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
(OC) It's me.
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
Yeah, yeah.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
What? Why not?
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
You can go.
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
Wait a--
He could have died
Some ugly baby, huh?
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
George!
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
All right, sir.
You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?
I'll pay for it.
I cut it.
I will.
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
You still have no proof.
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
Who was Pippi Longstocking?
Hey.
Oh, he's...he's a joy...
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
Why don't you just flip a coin already?
(uncomfortable) Ooh.
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
Did you have a nice ride?
Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.
Oh, no.
Now those look good, they're very bold.
Yes.
*YOU* took my seat!?
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
This cantaloupe stinks.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
(sighs Wa-ah) I don't know...a year?
WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.
Where is someone? I'm starving.
Oh really, you like 'em?
Yeah, pretty much.
Why?
Vincent?
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
So, what do you think?
Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
Will you shut up? I can't hear!
What do you want!?
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
(Sourly) I'll make a note of it.
There are plenty of things to say.
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
Televising opera?
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
I *love* the Drake.
Kramer, what is wrong with you?
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
Right.
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing)
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
YOU feel?
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
Oh-kay. Gimme the large.
What was it?
(Passionately) Oh Bob! Bob!
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
(sighs) So 10 to 14 months.
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
Hi, Jer.
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
Hmmm?
She's the one you went out with last night?
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
Yeah, but you like the face painting.
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
That sounds urgent...
No. I'll just walk home.
What?
Where did you go?
And Ill be right upstairs?
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
Then how are all these people getting together?
Goodbye?
We're just, you know, having a good time.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
(as though receiving a revelation) Poppies!
Oh, did you check you machine?
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
What's going on?
He's waving..
And I want my keys back from you!
It's me.
(neutral) Alright.
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
Do you smell something?
Hey!
Jerry?
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
(to self in head) This is unbelievable..
Then how did she find out, Jerry?!
Custom designed?
Happy Festivus, Georgie.
Yeah.
It doesn't matter.
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
We just didn't think of you.
What?
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
This was my idea you stole my idea.
I never told you his name.
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
We can't ask him...
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
Really? You really think I should fire her?
Oh, come on.
Well, how could he do that?
(on buzzer) Meh.
Well, what did you intend, Hal?
Okay.
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
Oh, no! Come on Jerry.
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
Well, I felt a call for one.
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
How high did I go?
A fake number! Blimey!
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
Ow! Careful, it's hot.
Uh ha.
You sure you don't need any help?
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
Nice to meet you, Poppie.
My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carousel.
What? What is that?
The remote goes through the bubble?
Raquel Welch!
Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials)
(with pain) Hi Evelyn.
Throw down your key.
I don't know. Chuck it?
George's Susan?
What?
Hey, what happened to you?
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
No, what?
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
Noooooooooooo!
Kitzmiller.
Two, three hundred?
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
The black and white?
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
Yes indeed.
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
All right. Witness? (looks at George).
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
Oh...my God.
Why?
Hi.
You're giving him *ten* dollars?
I thought he was Kramer's friend.
Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous.
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
Book it.
I'm having people over.
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
I thought you wore silk underwear.
Was it a cup or a bowl?
See ya'.
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
Oh please no more.
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
(flirtatious) Hi Jerry.
So we can go anywhere we want?
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
Good for you.
No, no! They'll stay up!
Whatever.
I met him.
Did you see that?!
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
I went to visit him.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
Come in, come in!
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
Well done. (pats George on the shoulder)
I guess I'm... Lois Loan.
Sure. Water Pik, floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.
Jerry?
This. My office. Sam trashed my office.
Listen, was Russell at the casting?
Like you're a liar!
He seems to be breathing.
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
Give it give it ..
what is with the gum?
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
(fierce) I will!
(resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine.
Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
Hey! Guess who's not married.
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
Uh, no. Not really.
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
No, actually, you're not being funny now.
Call him again.
All right, what the hell.
O, your being auditted? What for?
So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
I touched 'em.
All right.
Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.
What?
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
Hey Kramer, Kramer!
My Puddy? But we broke up.
What?
I don't like this, it is to easy.
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
What guy?
Oh, my God... The Mohatma?
[exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
Casus belli.
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
What?
Babu Bhatt did it.
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
What is that?
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
I know.
My father, really? I had no idea.
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
Aaron
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
Yeah? Like what?
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
(looking up to the salesman)
What is wrong with Ned?
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
(gasps) I cannot believe this!
You have no choice.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
Which one is he?
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
Are you serious?
Oh, dear.
Mmmnn, Georgie!
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
huh, Mine's 145.
So what did he have to say?
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
Kramer, we like her.
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
They're from Malaysia.
Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
Ya know?
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
What air conditioner?
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
What are you doing?
Very mature.
You mean..?
I'll see you tomorrow.
Uh... I...
I say, it's a peach.
Yeah, exactly, the "triangle" guy.
Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
What-- What are you looking at me for?
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
Yeah..heheah (laughing a bit)
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
(triumphant) Ha, ha, ha ha!
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
(shrill) You're engaged!
What's wrong with your shower?
What?
What did I do?
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
Give me the money.
George, you got a little something, right here.
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.
I'm sorry you have to go.
Get offa me!
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
Yeah.
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
Hey.
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
Ah. ...Yeah.
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
Ah...
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
The pick?
I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
What is going on with you two?
It is funny.
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
Then how come we're not moving?
I lied
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
85?
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
That was two months ago.
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
Oh. (Leaves for the room)
You sure you dont mind?
You already ate?
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
This is his home?
His place...
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
Yeass.
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
(Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
But it's a line from that song!
I don't believe this woman.
Seriously, we don't.
What?
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
What?
'Cos I'm not in the mood.
"Yeah. What happened was...."
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
He has good days and bad.
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
What, are you in a bad mood?
Why not.
Are you sure?
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
Yeah? What else?
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
Yeah!
Yeah. It is.
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
Well, wait---wait a second.
Hi Julie.
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
(Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?
Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.
Oh, of course! She's deranged.
(giggling) Ohhh!!.
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
(offering a drink) Snapple?
She gave it to charity.
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
What?
(happy gasp) Oh.
Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go.
I know.
What was that?
I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
He's not ga-ga.
(thrilled) She died?!
What?
You know why? One word shade.
Whats that?
What? Why not?
Wha- a picture?
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
How ya feeling?
Just me and George?
What do you charge for blown shocks?
Well, Fred asked me out.
So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?
So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh)
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
Sure!
It's a new area code.
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
Exactly.
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
Why not?
Ed.
So... impudent.
(excitedly) Okay.
It's okay, you don't
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
What?
All right! You know what, just forget it!
Why does it shrink?
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
Softer.
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
Um, well what's the difference?
Hey hey
Uhmm...
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
Yeah, I am so sorry.
What--what did I say?
(delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman.
You were snooping.
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
Shut up!
Oh.
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
No. I can't smell it.
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
So what? That's easy.
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
[annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.
But you were!!
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
(passing him the ketchup) Oh, sure.
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
What?
(indicating) That's her. That's her.
So what movie are you guys seeing?
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
Come on, father, you can make it.
No. In what way?
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
So? Where were you?!
Nedda?
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
(indifferent) Yuh.
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
They're going to promote me to editor.
Dana Folley.
(sarcasm) Alright, good job.
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
No, you can't be trusted!
We have to break up.
No, get-get off my purse!
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
I never saw anyone play like that.
But you said it was in the store!.
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally.
The Tonight Show?
You don't have any furniture?
*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
Too tight?
Yeah Jerry.
Well...
That's at the airport, right?
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
But he's so small.
No, I mentioned the bisk.
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
(raising her hand) Scuse me, master packer...
Right.
Aren't you?
Well, they're not kept in little cages.
CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.
JERRY Cosmo
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
(annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing)
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
Tomato Sauce?
O.K. Thanks.
He's not THAT religious.
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
Well, either way
Hey.
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
I'll see you.
But I wanted to see the bushmen.
Why is she doing this?
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
Oh, Kramer.
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
HI
What's with him?
I've got a confession to make.
Yeah
Yeah, how about her?
Oh!
Ohhhhh, that's great.
Well, I'll see ya... (exits)
What? Was it something I said?
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
(bearing up) I'm fine.
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
Yes! Couldn't you see that?
Uh uh
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
Hey. What's this.?.
What?
(concerned) What? Lloyd is here?
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
Yeah?
We try.
Hey.
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.
you can't spare it??
What the hell was that?
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
You gotta open the vault.
Yeah.
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
What?
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
(chuckles)
Hey, what do you think of this?
I have to eat!
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
Are you coming with me?
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
"What are you..crazy?"
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
Yeah, right.
You don't know?
Oh, I'm not very good.
Hi.
Yeah!
What?
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
It's possible.
(Nodding) Yeah, yeah..
Take it away.
Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.
Did you try the cigarettes?
(admiring gasp) Fabulous.
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
A wedding? Have you lost it, man?
Wow. You really have a terrible voice.
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
Forget it. You are very careful with money.
(quietly) What?
So go buy a new one.
Who is he?
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
Why?
Yep.
Of course there's a community.
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!
You're... poor AND married?
What is it?
I don't have a boyfriend.
So, guess who called me.
(tossing the ball back) Yeah.
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
But what??
Try it on.
Im just curious.
(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
(Whispering to Jerry) Hey.
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
Oh please.. It's in the vault.
What happened?
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
Yeah, she's a package full of something.
Out.
Why don't you just go see Jerry?
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
Ah, I didn't know who he was!
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
Maybe he likes her.
Nope.
Really?
Hmmm, I dont think so.
Oh, congratulations
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
I have a personal commitment.
Huh.
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
They were stolen.
What did I say?
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
Really? What is it about?
Yeah sure.
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
Hey!
Why should you get the first class?
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
A big coincidence.
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
yeah.
No.
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
Huh?
Very much.
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
So, what are you saying?
That, had to be invented?
No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
Kneel?
How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
Oh, well that's just *great!*
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
I don't know. What do you think?
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
I said, All Right.
For nothing..
(to George) Mm-hmm.
I dunno.
Why?
There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
Ahem. 646? What is this?
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
That's great George.
It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
Hey.
It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.
It's disgusting.
I thought you had done this before.
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
(shocked) Blaine!?
What?
Uh oh.
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
Hi.
No, I just have a cold.
She's not bitter!
Oh my god, where is it?
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
Do you mind?
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
Hi
So? What'd they say?
I'm marchin'. (Enter George)
I can't get off the kishkas.
Cleaning supplies?
(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
I didnt get that joke either.
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
(Through intercom) Yeah.
Oh, yeah...
What happened?
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
Oh, thanks. I've got plans.
Why would he come to George?
Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
I don't wanna!
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
Yes, that's correct.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
Where are they?
I've got that magazine article for you.
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
Casus belli.
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
Ahh.
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
Since when is a drain a toilet?!
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
Why do I keep setting you up?
Hey.
Oh my god.
Yeah.
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
Jerry, talk to that guy again.
All right, ha ha
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
You can say that again.
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. (steps down)
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
You're buying a speedboat?
Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.
(big smile) Okay.
I turned him. He defected.
Mm-hmm.
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
It's dancing.
What?
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
Yeah, Im gonna work on that
(makes an irked noise)
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
I'm good.
Start smoking.
You got me cash?
I am not going to ask him about funguses.
Oh, that's fantastic.
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
Hey, when you walk him, do ya...
You punched who in the mouth?
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
Hi.
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
You can tip a gardener.
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
Are you sure you want us here for this?
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!
Well, uh, fan. My father--
Some house, huh?
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
Have you gone in there?
Nelson.
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
Would you change yours?
hey
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
Enjoy. (she leaves)
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?
my god, you didn't.
Oh, she got hurt.
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
Lithe.
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
So, its the same thing.
(enters) Hey.
( knocks) Hello is anybody here?..
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
Wha..wha...?
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
Uh-huh
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
Well, nobody *told* me that!
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
(Mock sympathy) Well.. David, it happens.
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
Pooh...(laughing)
Is that the supermodel?
(screams).
You what?
Since when?
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
Ha ha ha ha.
You mean like like?
By marriage.
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
What?
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
Went out with Cynthia.
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
No?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?
No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as that.
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
It's Elaine.
O.K. O.K. Remy.
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
You sure? Anything?
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
There he is.
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
No, it's from the store.
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
Uh,
Noooo.
Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?
(To Ping) I did not jaywalk.
Well..hum...let me rephrase that, She said....
What could happen?
I don't think we should be talking about this.
Hi, (sighs) you got the organizer?
Because it's insane?
How much do you want for it?
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
Babs?
What are you doing here?
Yeah me too.
He was laughing?!
I've touched mine!
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue.
Oh, I'm not, uh...
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
You got any room on that thing?
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
Ohh!
Oh really?
What is the difference?
Mr Peterman, you...
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
Oh, they won't?
Hi Sheila.
Thanks
Didnt work, huh?
Cookies?
What?
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
Well use a paper towel.
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
Eh, I like mine.
I really like the city.
I think I might.
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
What? What is with all these books?
What're you stopping here for?
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...
Oh.
Come on up.
 Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
Ah! Orgasm?
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
10th
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
I dunno.
Ah, this. And that.
Ohh!
Oh good.
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
No?
(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
In them?!
What? What, you dont want to go now?
You want it?
Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.
No.
Yea.
So, what did you say?
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
These aren't my keys!
Why can't he play for us?
Oh, god! Let us out!
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
He thinks you're a phony?
What happened?
Rules.
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
Ha! That's preposterous.
I...touched...'em.
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.
Forget it!
It's Elaine Marie Benes.
How dare you!
The executor? Of what?
Yea, I guess that could work.
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
They don't get that much.
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
Manuscript?
You did.
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
Excuse me?
Oh god, Who's suitcase is this?
You went...in the shower?
Gone.
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!
You look ridiculous in that thing.
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?
Yes (clears her throat) yes I did.
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
Oh, fantastic.
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
You did didn't you.
(shrugging it off) Oh.
(to Kramer) Yeah, so?
Hey George.
What do you think of the catalog?
The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?
Um, no.
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
No there has got be a mistake.
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
(Mocking) Yeah, I'll chew on that.
Not bad huh?
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
"Who's the Drake"?
Yeah.
You got that right.
You got it?
(softly to Dick) Dick.
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
Hmm.
Plan B? There is no plan B.
No that's Radio!
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
I smell cherry.
Well, thank you father.
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
I'm not telling you.
It's Elaine.
Hi.
Sure, fine.
(to self in head) Bizarro world..
Hi.
Excuse me...
Okay.
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
(Concerned) What's the matter?
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
Soup's not all that good anyway.
(raises her hand) Yo.
I didn't get it.
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
What's up?
3 squares? you can't spare 3 squares??
[gasps]
Right, I think its this
No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!
I'll go to Paris.
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
(quietly) Ahhhhh
Oh Tomorrow...?
