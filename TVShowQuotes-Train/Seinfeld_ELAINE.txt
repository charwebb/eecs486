Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
Jerry!
I know that look.
Why not?
It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
Yes, but then he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
Because we're adults?
I have to go to the bathroom too (runs to be ahead of Jane; Jane stops and looks back at Jerry; Jerry shugs)
Wow. Youre right. That is loud.
Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
Huh?
Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?
What did he do?
You been enjoying them?
Ohhh! Golden Boy?
What are you doing with this couch?
400 sugar fix.
Its right down here to the left. I will uh meet you right back here.
Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!
Hmmm, I dont think so.
No.
(Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 915! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 915!
I like Julie. She's very personable.
No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
Good. Now fix me a drink.
Five minutes.
"Penthouse?"
What is wrong with George?
He said hed give me a lift.
Oh, were neighbors. Ill be here all the time!
rock climbing? hehe.. where do you come off going rock climbing.. rock climbing? you need a boost to climb into your bed (Elaine laughs)
I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
You're wrong.
(to Paul) You're checking it out?
This is an absolute disaster.
Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
Well, there's a doctor right here.
Hi.
Oh, I missed you!
Yeah.
What?
Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.
No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
Ah. ...Yeah.
You got that right.
Tell me!
What? What happened to the new Jerry?
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
I don't know. It's a building.
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
(Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.
Hey, what's going on?
Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
yeah ha ha ha
(shrugging it off) Oh.
Why do they call it a wedgie?
Well, you have to admit... the circumstantial evidence...
Oh, you know what? He got engaged.
Right after ... that ...
Yeah.
Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like that bother me? No, not a bit. It's nothing. It's nothin', it's um, in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you want to know something? I, I wish I had one. [pause] Really.
Artie Shaw. "Honeysuckle Jump." (The song ends.)
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
Hey Boys-O!
(Nodding) Yeah, yeah..
Shut up and pack!
Yes.
(under her breath) Ya that'll happen)
You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)
It.
"Yeah!"
Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
I don't know.
Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.
All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
Hey.
How?
It shrinks?
No, no, I'm leaving.
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
What could I be saying?
I never knew you were so into breasts. I thought you were a leg man.
Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?
Where's my chart? Did you get it?
All right. Take it easy.
Oh my god.
Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...
It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know.
So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.
Yeah
(raises her hand) Yo.
That's stealing?
I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a secret about my bra.
Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
Mr. Peterman, um--
Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
Still?
That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
Yeah.
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
Take it away.
Well...
So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and then she forcibly tried to get me to remove it.
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
I'm not even in here!
My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
(shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God.
What's the matter?
Do you pick it up?
All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
(Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.
Nah it's nothing.
Uhm...
It's the play button, off his VCR.
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
(stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back.
Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
Oh, God!
Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
I know! Can you imagine that?
(grudging) Alright.
Why? What's wrong with it?
Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
Ah.
Well, you know what? (removes glasses)
Oh, no! I thought--
That is not the point.
No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
Tomorrow .
(shrill) You're engaged!
Ill eat out.
I'm not mad.
uh huh (very quietly)
Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
She's the one you went out with last night?
You got me a note?
So?
What?
"Mrs. Onassis's"? That's hard to pronounce.
Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
Aah!
Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
What-- What are you looking at me for?
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
Yeah, I'm on the phone here.
I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
Hey, how are we gettin' to Scott Drake's party on Saturday night?
Yeah, yeah.
I gotta go return something...
Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
Oooh!!
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
(smiling and flirty) Hi.
Right
Nice to see..
I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
So when are we gonna eat?
We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)
Oh-kay. Gimme the large.
Yeah, Art Vandelay.
Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
(impatient) Get out!
I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
Jerrryyy, How can I go on?
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
Hey! Wait up!
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
I can't believe you said that.
(Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.
Yeah that! So, . . .
Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
No, really.
Wrong side?
So, how did it end?
(shocked) Oh my God.
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
Call him again.
No!
I'll see you later.
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.
Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited.
(Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
Remember that Columbus book?
Yeah.
You got the tickets right?
Well I'm going to hell.
What else have you got?
I just said the same thing to you.
(excitedly) Okay.
My god, George!
Okay, I'm done.
David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
What is that noise? What is that noise?
(points) I like Witchy Woman.
You have no idea who Im talking about, do you?
They rehearse all the time?
At the movies.
No.
Egh, Jake Jarmel?
Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
Huh?
..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.
To please Mr. Pitt.
Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel *so* *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I haven't even met the woman yet.
Bye.
Hey. Hey everybody.
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
No they don't.
Huh?
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
Binaca?
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
you know I hate to tell you this, but it's time to defrost that freezer
What was that?
Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
Oh Tomorrow...?
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
No there has got be a mistake.
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didnt have wooden teeth, you did!
Oh, hi Fred.
"Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's."
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
(shouts) Oh, go to hell!!
Colors.
(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?
How much is this?
Hi. Can I get to my seat?
Oh, but it's ok for me?
You just left? What did you tell her?
So, you're gonna get a new couch?
What? What is goin' on with you two?
"Elaine got a new dress."
Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
No it isn't.
So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
Well Jerry told me that you did.
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
(sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo.
Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.
(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
Ill go if I dont have to talk.
You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
Ah Oh!!
She's not gonna twirl--
Why does it shrink?
(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
Aawwh Please.....
Forget it. You are very careful with money.
He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys.
Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
(looks up, screaming in frustration!) Suuuuuuuuuuze!
So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
No. Do you ever think about it?
Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!
(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!
(concerned) What? Lloyd is here?
(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
Yes. Who it this?
Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
Fusilli Jerry?
Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
So what are your parents doing here in new York?
Vanessa.
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
I don't eat Oreos.
And then you flush.
Was it a cup or a bowl?
It's me.
Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
David
What?
I didn't know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know, that's not my fault.
Oh.
Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
What happened?
I've lost 6 pounds.
Oh my God.
You.
Oh Jerry, dont blow this for me.
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
Uhmmm huh! Is it important.?
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
Tuna?
Jerry!
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.
An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
I thought she was the one.
Yeah. What do you do all day?
Do you have an apple or anything?
Come in, come in.
(pause) Man, Hands?
Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.
I know.
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.
Find out what's going on!
You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.
Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)
No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
(quiet) Look at this turnout.
Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
"He's performing at this AMCA benefit."
I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
Have a good game.
What? No, no, I'd rather...
So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
(Concerned) What's the matter?
An IQ test.
This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
Hey, What are you doing out here?
Huh . So What's it about?
Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
Why? What happened? Did you talk?
What? What happened?
OKAY!!!
Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
Yeah. Upstairs?
Why?
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
No, I mentioned the bisk.
What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
Thank you very much.
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
But you lied first.
Cookies?
I staked out his health club.
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.
I said rubber fire.
Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. (blowing nose) Really. I mean that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank... yoooou!
because of the gum
Hello
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
Why couldn't you just wait?
So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
Mmm!
Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?
What was that look?
Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?
But you didn't say anything. Ohhh
(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
(laughs)
Since when is a drain a toilet?!
Oh.
(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
(on the intercom) It's me, are you ready to go?
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...
Portuguese?
Well, what do you want me to do?
What? What is with all these books?
I think it would be romantic.
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
Who has the remote? (wipes a tear from her eye)
Ach, maybe.
Kramer, forget it.
Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
A lot!
Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
Id better not.
. . . no.
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
I'm gonna do a little firing.
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.
Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.
Yes, I will, George. Ill have to stick my chin on top of the seat.
Yeah? Well, I got news for you.
Correct. (catches herself) What's that?
Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.
George. How come you're whispering?
Nah! They're fake!
It's not just hair! Look!
... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
Really, what was the first?
Hey.
Hello, Tim.
You haven't told him?
Mr. Lippman, how are you?
I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
Hey.
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman in the face. I mean I keep thinkin' that that goiter's gonna start talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they send you over there "Oh, by the way, this woman *almost* has a second head". But no, no, I didn't get any goiter information.
Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
Yeah
She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
Oh, well, Im staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.
What?
(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
Casus belli.
There's no time.
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
That, had to be invented?
Did you see that?!
Where'd you get this?
Oh, no.
Maybe he likes her.
You sure you want his face?
Kramer, is that you?
... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.
I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
Hellllloo.
Hello.
Oh, you can have mine. Ill ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?
Well, uh, I'd watch the third base coach if I were you 'cause I don't think he's waving you in. You know I hate to say this but I think we're really hitting it off. Get it? Get it?
Oh, he's not on drugs.
Ahh ... wait till you hear this.
Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
I dunno.
Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
I don't think so.
Almost.
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
He did.
Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?
Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
Ask Jerry.
Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
Boy, I'm gettin' a good sweat here. Great sweat, good beads. Nice beads.
Yes.
No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.
Oh, all right.
Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
Are there any good Italian restaurants around here?
Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem.
Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
What happened?
Wait a--
(mouths silently) Okay.
Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
He'll only play with his racquet
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
No.
Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
No?
It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
All right, Jerome, I'm in.
Yeah.
He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
C'mon.
(Smiling, proud) I said, "yeah."
Did you tell Kramer?
Yes, it's a must lie situation.
I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...
(feeling sick) Yeah! go ahead.
It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
Okay...Good day..
Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? Cmon. Cough it up.
You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
Fine, fine, fine.
You don't like them?
No that's the week after.
Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
Thank you.
Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!
What?
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
They don't know anybody in Chicago.
Correct.
David? David, I think we aught to talk.
No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
Oh my god, where is it?
Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
uh, ha.
Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.
(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
You want it?
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
(Pausing) Even so.
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours that I would *rather* smell than what's livin' in your car.
I don't like to talk during a massage.
(setting down her glass) Oh, ya haha.
What statue?
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
I'm sure it's right around here.
*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
You know, George, that's an onion.
You? I'm more responsible than you are!
He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
Tim.
(Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
I'm sure he was just joking around.
And now, theres this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, its like we really hate each other. Its based on nothing.
what about it?
Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...
Yeah, me too.
Mm-hm.
He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?
It's not serious, is it?
Yeah. That's what I just said.
George I wasnt serious.
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
Better call the zoo.
This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
[momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small?
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
Me?
Huh. All right. Come on.
Oh, hi.
Well, he's not a baseball player.
Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.
What do they have there, a couple of beds?
So I'm not gonna be an usher?
What?
Uh, I guess I hadn't--
I talked with the groom's parents..
He collects (holds up magazine) these?
So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
"Top of the Muffin to you!"?
Jerry?
Hello?
Well, I'm dating a communist.
So?
What about Switzerland?
Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.
Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.
Uhhh...
Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
Get out!
You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
Its OK. (starts walking down the hallway)
Im leaving.
No. I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell. He called me the other day. He won't quit.
Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
Bob!
Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
George's Susan?
Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
I'll catch it!
You're father was blacklisted?
I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
That's impossible...
What black guy?
Yeah, but we have a common goal.
Some ugly baby, huh?
Arghhh, look it's a fire! (cough)
Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.
Alright, there's no---
Call Kramer.
Yeah.
Hey, "great" organizer you gave me.
Noreen, were you hitting on him?
(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
Kramer.
Oh my!
All right. Spill it, Jerome.
Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
What?
I guess it's you, Jer.
Come on.
My most, just heartfelt congratulations.
Hellllllooooo.
Well, it's for my boss.
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
"Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those..."
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
So tell me more about this game SIX.
Ooh, it's a cake walk.
Right.
Sheets.
Jerry.
I can tell. You know how you're always bragging how you can spot a lesbian?
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.
Im not so sure he wants one.
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
No. She died.
Get out!
What were you doing watching the door anyway?
I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
Congratulations.
What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
"Do you wanna go or not?"
Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
Seven-and-a-half.
[delightedly] Oh! You "pillage and plunder"?
(interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry!
"Ughhhh"
You know, Kenny Rogers has a-
Hey what's that?
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
Hey!
But I didn't do anything.
Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
She...likes you..
No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!
"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
Okay, so fine. Go.
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
Hide!
Why? Why d'you think he's upset?
I know.
Yeah me too.
We're engaged?
"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Hi/Hey.
Out, damn heal!
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
Very funny. That's very funny.
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
Yeah.
(quietly) Ok.
Are you alright?
So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
What about me?
The black and white?
Oh, I don't remember them.
Huh.
(Confused) Love newton?
Noo, thanks.
Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
He is not a drug addict!
Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
'...singing a song, side by side...'
Do you have a...ketchup secret?
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
Ahh-cnee.
[mind] This is getting awkward.
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
Huh. Well this is a little awkward, isn't it/
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
You're buying a speedboat?
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
What?
No no, no no, don't don't, I beg you
Run down your case for me again...?
I am an associate.
At Yankee Stadium?
Aah!
Hi E-an
Yes.
Hey!
No, nothing.
And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!
Yeah, I'll take it.
Jerry, She looks exactly like you.
(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.
Yep.
No. Stay! Stay. Stay.
Hmm. Tonight.
Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
(to the black waitress) Long day?
Um. Kramer!
Wh..?
Get out of here! Why?
All right. I'm going I'm going
To Ravas house. Ive gotta pick up her manuscript.
Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
(looking up to the salesman)
(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
Ah, right there, yeah.
(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
Ohh!
I...touched...'em.
What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
Mm-hmm.
You don't know?
That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
No that's Radio!
Do you realize what youre saying?
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
No.
Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
Oh, you come on.
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?
(still in disbelief) You painted your face?
Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
Cosmo, Cosmo?
Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
Enjoy. (she leaves)
They all are.
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking havoc, making everybody nervous.
I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.
All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
Oh! Where are you going?
Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
Do you want something to read?
Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.
No.
Good.
No!
I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
Why not?
The pig says "my wife is a slut."
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
Hey guys...
Hey, do you believe I got Happy New Yeared today? It's February.
No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!
No, No...
Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
So what movie are you guys seeing?
I dunno.
That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
You took him over to Celia's?
Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
Yeah.
You flew here coach.
Did you get a thank you wave?
Jackie says put it on, Jerry.
You're not taking me back?
(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
I don't think we should be talking about this.
Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down)
Okey-dokey.
You think we're far enough.
Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
What if it worked out?
Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
Nooo, the other thing.
(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!
Yeah Jerry.
Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
I picked up his mail while he was on the road
It's Vegetable Lasagna.
Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
It is funny.
Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
Ah, I'm ready what?
So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
no it is not
At work?
Joel...
Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
(to someone in the hallway) No, Ill be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning.. (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt its great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?
I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
Really? What is it about?
So, waddya' going to do?
Yeah, that's right.
"Yeah!"
I know.
You think Ihave grace?
Which ones?
Hi! This is my friend George.
(chuckles)
Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?
Kramer, we like her.
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
(quietly) No, no, no, I can cancel.
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
Nothing.
Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 1015. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?
Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
You know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys are gonna be rich!
It could be very confusing.
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
Right, I think its this
Sorry.
I'll see you tomorrow.
How much did he save?
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
Whats the rent?
Oh, yeah. I see him.
Hello, Jerry.
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
"Ahum!"
Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
How can you possibly show your face there again?
The pygmy pullover.
Whoa.
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
Alright, well, now that's something..
Yeah.
Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!
Couldnt agree more.
Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
So what are their plans?
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
See what is that? Is that a date?
(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
What, you don't think she's beautiful?
I'm sure they're not.
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
Well, how are we gonna do it?
Faster.
No no no, they weren't here before.
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
(puzzled) You? What're you doing here?
so listen, what happened last night with Jane?
I was begging her "please! please!" she was insane
Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.
Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
THIS is what you came up with?
You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
Well, I felt a call for one.
All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
why does she have to chew so many?
That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
Anyway, he's in the hospital, he's having surgery and I feel like should go visit him.
But it was in pen. You fake erase.
Kramer, you're hurting me!
The book is great. Did you go out last night?
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...
I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
is it?
I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
The New Yorker has poetry.
Hey.
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Great...
Are you doing new material?
What?
No....Oh No....
By marriage.
(Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
Yeah?
We can't ask him...
Really.
Ahem. 646? What is this?
Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
(dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him.
Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
It's your house.
Huh, go ahead, tell him.
She died!
Oh, okay, go ahead.
Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
I think it's OK.
Not bad huh?
Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.
Of course I support your decision to change your name.
Goodbye.
I didnt get that joke either.
(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
Hi
Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose)
And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
Yeah.
Ok, so now what?
Whhhy?
What?
We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
Well I figured that's what couples do.
Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...
Double or nothing.
Man, Kramer! I could kill him!
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
It was an accident.
Hey. Hi Maestro.
Okay...Thanks a lot for the ride.
I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
Yeah, right.
Kramer!
Well that's not sex.
Certainly not.
(to Mrs Allister) Janitor's meeting.
Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh!
Yeah, like you must procreate.
(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
What are you gonna do in there?
Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
What little deal?
You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
Oh, of course! She's deranged.
Ohh, I got your coffee.
Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
[To Jerry] What about you?
I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?" guy.
Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
Uh huh...
Exactly.
Yeah, you want five?
Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.
(discouraged) Five days. Here.
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
Yeah, that's right.
Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
When are you leaving?
It can be very frustrating.
What? Why?
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
You really think he wants the bike?
... date with Fred.
You're eating my food!
How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?
You wanna go out with him?
Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
Oh-oh, but-
Stunned by soup?
What's the matter with him?
Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
I wouldn't sign one.
He has good days and bad.
(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
Well some people drink coffee that late.
You can't be bleak in spring.
Bye Eeeen.
You don't know?
Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
That's a good idea.
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
We are... that means that we ah, we are...
(Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?
Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
You already ate?
Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
So, what d'you think?
Hey. Where's the car?
Well, one of those glasses.
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
(she leaves hurriedly) I gotta gooo...
Why?
How's that gonna happen?
Wow.
Cows, well that's fascinating...
I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.
Get that out of my face.
(turning to them, awkward) It's locked..
Right!!
Peterman is gonna kill me.
(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
(gasps)
"It's me?" Isn't it a little premature?
I didn't know you SMOKED.
Why Japan?
Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
*YOU* took my seat!?
You're not too cold?
"I don't care"
Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
Delish. You know, short for delicious.
He did the move.
Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
That's sounds pretty juvenile.
Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
What?
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
What do you mean?
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
So?
Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
Theyre very clean animals.
Right there.
Hu hu, ha ha ha.
No, what?
(Catching another glimpse of Roy eating) Hunh, Please can we go to the Poconos?
I don't know.
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
Yeah, what?
Why?
Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
Dave, um, painted his face.
What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
Isn't that a little...rash?
Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
Anything else?
(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.
(distractedly) Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make...
Downtown?
(To Ping) I did not jaywalk.
Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
I'm in the stall and there's no toilet paper
Uh, Mr. Pitt...
Well he frightened me.
So where do you get this note?
Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
you know (acts like a monster)
Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
Oh, uh, I didn't know.
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of control.
No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.
Maybe I should just get married.
Noooooooooooo!
Will you just park it already?
You'll do well, you're smart.
Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
No, that's not your coat.
All right, sir.
(to George) He's still down with his folks.
Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
Why are you yelling at the TV?
Hey.
Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
Who are they?
I dont care, Im not hungry.
Ah, This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
No.
Come in.
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
Who is it?
Kramer, what's the matter with you?
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
it's Elaine
(offering a drink) Snapple?
They're um, Botticelli's.
What?
Let's start the bidding.
So this is never gonna stop?
Then how are all these people getting together?
Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.
Yeah.
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
Boogey?
Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
Will you turn around?
You're bringing in an ouside cucumber?
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?
(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
. . . shut up! (?)
(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.
Excuse me.
(gasp) Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognize you! You look so...
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
That will be fun.
What?
I can't get off the kishkas.
You're... poor AND married?
Aah! Okaaay.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
Wha'd you come in here for?
She's not bitter!
Well, that'll get you goin' right there...
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
Where are they?
Shot.
Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?
"You can't find beauty in a man?"
Yes I am.
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
So where are we staying?
It's the next best thing to being alone.
Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
I told ya.
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
Its all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.
10th
I'm just thinking about the question.
You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
What?
How many?
Oh! Do tell sir?
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
Did you give him the room number?
Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
No, I talked him into it.
Shut up!
ok step off George, can u just step off?
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
a ply?
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
We're straightening out?
Yeah, Yeah!!
(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
What for? Let's just get out of here.
Oh, hi honey.
How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
Joe DiMaggio?
Yes.
I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't even get my arms around you...
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
Make it ten.
What? What, you dont want to go now?
I need some space.
Oh, I know! It is awful!
Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
Do I smell something? What am I, hard of smelling? Of *course* I smell something.
Still a 31 waist?
COSMO?
Hello.
Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)
Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
Hey.
Love ... Susan.
Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
What are you talking about?
Boy, too bad. If I was up there, youd never hear a peep out of me. Im as quiet as a mouse.
(Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green.
(pushes him) You doofus!
so I ask this woman in the stall next to me for some and she refuses! ha ha
What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
Ah hah.
(Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
Hello.
Hey George.
At least it wasn't atomic.
Cash?
You remember the date?
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
A little stale.
I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
Right. Go right!/South!
Books, Jerry.
Yeah.
I found it!
Oh, that's not too expensive.
Oh, Jeffrey.
(off-camera) It's Lainey!
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
All right, let's just forget it.
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend Paul.
What're you doing?
"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
Who else is on the show?
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
Is George here?
Why not?
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
Well I have to be going.
Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
No! Jerry! Jerry!
Drake gave her the TV?
You know Sue Ellen Mishke?
I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
Hey.
What are you gonna do down there?
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
(Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
Then how did you find the place?
Oh.
Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
Yeah, she's a package full of something.
(to George) Hey.
(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
(Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.
Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
Hi.
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
Yeah, we're good friends.
What?
Now look, don't take too long.
(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
What're you looking at?
Nah.
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
Was that Tim Whatley?
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
Come on!
Get out!
Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.
Hello, Frank.
Uh, it was in the Hamptons.
Downtown New York?
Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.
I'd rather not say.
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
Oh, man. We're stopping?
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
Yes...ummm, (leans into the microphone, pulling it closer it squeaks) yes, that's correct.
Joey? Joey?
Oh, tons!
Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
I'm okay, it's just a nip.
I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.
Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
No, no. But it is quite a coincidence.
Yeah? So?
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.
(Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
No!
I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
I kinda like her.
That was good. That was very good.
Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
I thought he was deported.
No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.
Out.
Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.
What are you doing?
What was it?
Have you gone in there?
...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
But I wanted to see the bushmen.
"Well.... (pointing at him) Jimmy!"
(neutral) Okay.
How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
See'ya.
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
Thirty-seven.
So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
(looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen...
We do what we can.
Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate.
Yeah, there is, right here you see--
Exactly.
Hello. Jerry's not here?
No, the Green Lantern.
I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
The sax player?
Nice to meet you, Poppie.
Yeah, but...*I* like the move.
Are you actually considering this?
No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
We found it. I can't believe it!
Is this gonna hurt?
How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
What did you do that for?
Dial 9- MERLIN.
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
What are you doing?
Oh, me too.
Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
Yeah, yeah, thanks.
Okay. We ready to go?
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
Night.
Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
This food was in the shower with you?
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
Then why get the massage?
My father, really? I had no idea.
You did enough.
No!
Devastating.
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
You never said you were fighting children.
No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)
Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?
(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
The executor? Of what?
George I don't even want to get --
He's a musician.
Im kinda full.
Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
Why? You don't wear glasses.
You told them that?
I did. He loves Rava. Worse, he loves Ray. And he didn't think youre funny at all.
Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
Nothing.
How could this have happened?
Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
What?
Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then its gone and its in your apartment.
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)
Whatever.
Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
No, you can't be trusted!
So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
You heard me. Strip!
What'd they say? What'd they say?
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
Hi, Gail.
So then what?
Hey.
Jerry, this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very uncomfortable.
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
I know he belches a lot.
Literally.
[Proudly] Really?
Someone I know!
I thought he was with you.
Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
Hi, Mr Peterman.
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
How close do you get?
And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
I'm so sorry George
Why?
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
I don't think so.
I never saw anyone play like that.
Hey! George look at this.
[laughs appreciably] Okay, gimme the `adult'.
"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
(Confused by her reaction) You are?
Mr Lippman?
Yeah.
A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
Excuse me...
Why not.
No!
Yeah, I'd like to place an order.
Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
Well! Well, it could be you.
I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
I said it.
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
Andre?
Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
Swan Lake, at the Met.
Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
Oh...well...
This is nice.
Oh god, Who's suitcase is this?
I think you're sticking it to me.
(English accent) Pardon?
Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.
No one.
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
Of course.
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
Where is someone? I'm starving.
So, you weren't born here?
I just met him this morning.
I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
Oh hey! How things doing in accounting?
So you say.
You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
But you were!!
Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.
 Hi! How are you?
Oh yeah, the curse toast.
Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
Oh, you'll be playing ...
No, no, that's okay, it's uh...
No!
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
What?
He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
Nothing, nothing.
(Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.
Why don't you just go see Jerry?
It's Elaine.
Hey.
Puddy, don't wait for me.
I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, yknow... cramp our styles?
On occasion.
Christmas present? For who?
Pffft....there's really nothing to do.
This is his home?
Oh!
People go to South America.
Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
Bye bye (shuts the door) oh.. (opens it back) George wait wait
They're from Malaysia.
You're not going to do any walking.
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
You found out Kramer's first name?
I'm sorry but there's somebody else.
Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
(Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
(looks straight into his eyes) Jerry.
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
No, you look pale.
Carefully?
(laughing).
Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
Oh, go down and get them.
(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.
He told you about . . .
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
(exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
What?
Wait, what pizza place idea?
Why don't you just blow it out your a...
Vivian...
He can really do that?
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...
No. Today's *your* lucky day.
Hello, hello.
So, what do you think?
(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
Oh, well that's just *great!*
(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
Really?
Nah, now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.
How do you know his name?
(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
(laughs)
Come on. Let me see it.
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
Right above you?
Oh, that creepy guy?
Been a while?
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
Oh that's a nice store.
Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?
(indifferent) Yuh.
laughing awkwardly Oh. Right. Good one.
Ellis.
(to Jerry) Five more days?
Hey.
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
Why is that?
Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
I dont know what your parents did to you.
Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
Argh.. Fleas ( strikes the purse she just deposited on the couch) How did you get fleas?
So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
Good.
Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
Ah! Ah!ah!
Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.
(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
You know what he does in there? He gargles.
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
Oh. Uhhh...
Why should I tell you?
"Yeah. What happened was...."
Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
Ohh!
He's coming up?
I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)
Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
Wow!
I've touched mine!
Ninety-five hundred.
I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
What?
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
Uh
Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
(worried) What? What?
Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. Hes the one who got me the apartment.
hey
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
What's that?
Yup.
Awwwwww.
You know karate??
The Supreme Court gives me the right to do that! Let's go Jerry, c'mon.
Oh...well...
What is this?
That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
Wow!
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only one who's touched 'em.
(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
Kitzmiller.
Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
Ok....
you know what, it's getting late, can I call Tony?
But it's got a pee-stain on it.
Kurt!
Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.
(Wide-eyed) So, she fell?
Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
(not convinced) Ech.
Give it give it ..
Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
(scoffs) Uh, is Noreen there?
No its not. That really is true.
Oh, bye. Good to see you.
(reading) At the Knights of Columbus?
Alright, let's do it.
Did you find the place alright?
Ooh.
Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...
Not, my Tim Whatley?
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.
What?
Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH)
Hi Jerry!
he's not a mimbo, he's an exciting, charismatic man he just happened to have a perfect face
Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
Bye.
Now those look good, they're very bold.
Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
something.. wrong?
(handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?
Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
Party of four? Who are we meeting?
Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
Oh yeah.
You signed the release.
I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
(Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.
Bye.
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
(warning) George.
That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
What?
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
Why? What happens if you don't order right?
Well.
Well wait a minute, there's a slight change of plans.
What about the couch?
Who did that? Who did that?!?
Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.
Jerry, the man is a doctor.
David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
(caught out) I did. Uh...
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
(shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?
What the hey.
Better, now.
Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
Do you want your old couch back?
(To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
I have a good masseuse you could go to.
Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
It is so forgotten.
That seems about right.
Yeah..Yeah...
(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
(Finishing it off) ..done that.
Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.
Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
(Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
Oh, it's you. We were just talking about you.
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
You know that guy downstairs?
Are you sure?
The one you broke the plans with tonight?
Told me what?!
Jerry?
I got a pebble.
You were big.
Yes, that's correct.
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
She's not Chinese?
So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
What meeting?
I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
(Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
He went back.
It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.
What, what is it?
Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
We were just trying to help.
Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.
that's nice. Listen, listen to this I am in the bathroom, right before the movie starts
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
Oh, you want one?
Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
Just in those commercials.
NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
Hi.
No, no, I'll be back.
Ah, "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all... alike.
Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.
Wha'd you get on your SAT's?
Uhh, I don't think so.
I know, he's so tiny!
Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
I'm going in .
Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
Why are you so concerned about this?
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
OK.
See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
Uh-huh
We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
So, will I see you later tonight?
Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
NO.
Ah! Orgasm?
(off camera) Huh.
I'm sorry, George, but it's true.
Look at that woman.
"What you do!!. You don't do anything."
Oh man, hes nuts.
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
[OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
Are you out of your mind?!
(Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
You know the Three Tenors?
(Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.
..And then there were three.
Yeah. You're right.
Okay. Im gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...
Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
What is this, a 'bit'?
Oh, no, I-I don't think so.
Jerry's a nazi?!
What's it?
Why didn't you stop me?
You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
(gesturing) There's this.
You didn't bring a brown sweater.
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
Ahhhhhh haa ha ha
His place...
Seven?
Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
You flinched.
Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
You think?
Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
In the back.
Hello.
Yeah. What is this all about
I just thought I could write it.
...ok I'll just....
I have to eat!
I guess she didn't think it was funny.
Is that something?
Desperado.
Excuse me, I was wondering if would it be possible if you could deliver the old couch to my apartment? It's not very far.
Can it cut that thin?
Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
(Extremely excited) The other guy?!
You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.
Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.
What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...
Just a hunch.
Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.
I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
They don't get that much.
Of course I hear that.
Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
Yeah. Right.
No.
So, he's...
Goodbye?
Yeah right, Salman Rushdie. Yeah well, I can see that - you got five millions Moslems after you, you wanna stay in pretty good shape.
What?
Why dont we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
Because you have an attitude.
No.
Milk?
Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
Yeah
Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
The pick?
Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
Hey, what time is it?
HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)
You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
(hopeful) Oh, you were?
Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
What are we gonna do there? Talk?
If you were a woman would you go out with him?
George.
(screams).
Right
You mean..?
(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
Jerry no, that's important to me.
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!
My Puddy? But we broke up.
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
Get it out!
(determined) Eleven thousand!
Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.
Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?
That is so stupid.
Don't say that!
I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
Ah.
You going to do something about your sideburns?
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
Who's that?
It's black, right?
Oh, gorgeous, yes.
How much did you pay for them?
That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
I'm not saying anything.
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
Oh! my God.
Forty bucks? Are they Sable?
O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
(sighs) So how about that Aaron?
Yeah, Kramer, come on in.
Yeah, they flip a coin.
I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
Do you think of anything?..
What do you mean you don't have the hat?
Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
What is this about?
What?!
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
Take a guess.
Where's Karen?
JERRY Cosmo
(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
No, no, come on. I guarantee it.
(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
Hey!
...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
It felt like a couple of levels.
Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
Yes.
Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.
What?
Oh man, there is nothing like a really big TV, huh?
What, you think I should have?
Aaahhhhh!!
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
"I do now."
You stole her clock?
You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
Thank you, Julie.
(Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!
Why?
[mind] Is he going to try to kiss me?
What call?
Just a little off the side...
Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
What's with the claw?
Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
Muchos gracias. (Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.) O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
Hey Todd.
Uhh, so frustrating!
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
Alright, gimme the phone... it's my "thing"...
You should show this to Georgie.
What's the difference?
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
No, he's just neat.
Televising opera?
What is it?
Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.
Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
What about the kiss goodnight?
Like clams.
I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and Ill watch it for you and Ill live there and Ill make sure that nothing happens to it.
What?!
I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.
Why did you get a maid?
Bye.
Uh, Kramer...
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
Chicken wing shoulder blades.
Went out with Cynthia.
Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.
Oh, well, (pauses) Good night.
I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
What?
Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
hmm where is Jerry sitting? he's supposed to be here tonight with his new girlfriend I'm dying to see what she looks like
You should run for mayor.
No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
Lena Small?
But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
So? What happened?
(as Darryl opens his door) Hey.
No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
Whoa. What is the matter?
Ah, what're you doing here?
What is this?
Is it *real* butter?
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
I think they went out to dinner.
You were you, but, you werent you...
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
Yeah.
What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
Jeannie... your fiancee.
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early some time...
George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
My manuscript?
(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?
Search... for Spock?!
What's going on?
Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
(Whispering to Jerry) Hey.
What?
(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
Are you coming with me?
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
(Flattered) Mr. Pitt...
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
(sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.
Me?
Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my office and I'll just sit there naked.
So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
Help us up so we can cross the street?
You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
Oh...nuts.
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
And you get along well with women.
Yep!
Hi.
I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.
You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
Well I didn't know.
See what?
Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
You do?
You know why? One word shade.
What's going on?
Yeah.
Well how about a carrot cake?
George, you got a little something, right here.
Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
So what? That's easy.
So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.
Oh, so---so that's it?
Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
Oh, okay.
I hate the good ones.
So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
(Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
Custom designed?
Oh, right...I forgot. (smiles)
(gasp)
I mean, stranger things have happened...
Pooh...(laughing)
(Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.
I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
Yeah it is nice actually.
Nothing has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey! What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something about this. Now you're eating here?
Hey, have you seen Anna?
Oh, he went insane?...
Oh no. No. I dont want to sit in the back. Ill be left out of the conversation.
You had an affair with Ghandhi? MRS. O He used to dip his bald head in oil and rub it all over my body. Here, look... [shows Elaine a picture of the two together]
Noooo.
(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
What do you wanna know?
What? What is so funny?
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
Then why did you print it.
That's ridiculous.
I hear ya, Sister.
Oh, Okay... well thanks a lot... sorry again about you and the Drake...
Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
Right.
Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.
Well, go, go.
What?
Theyre dying in the nets.
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
Absurd!
'Cos I'm not in the mood.
'Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
It's me.
As long as you don't put...
It is..
Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
My pleasure.
(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
But why? Why don't you want to?
He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
You don't ask.. You tell.
Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
Oh, great. Send him in.
You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
Jerry Seinfeld.
(very reluctant) Okay.
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
You did.
his face, did something happen to his face?
Kissing is not sex.
Gimme ten bucks and find out...
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
(MUMBLES) That's just about enough
Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
So what are you going to do?
yeah I mean, I mean what is my obligation here, you know we were just dating, it was probably gonna be over in a couple of weeks anyway
Hi.
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
Nervous?
Alright, well anyway, I think they're real. And if they are, I must say they are...spectacular.
He used to be called Peter.
Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?
No, no.
You still got that Fedex?
(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
Good night
(Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!
Superman can go back in time?
OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or something...
I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
I'm marchin'. (Enter George)
You've never felt remorse.
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
Hey!
( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
You don't like her?
What, the one who just left?
No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
Jerry, ... He's a GUY!
It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
It's me!
There, we just talked business.
He's got it.
(vicious) Fifteen thousand!!
And scuba diving.
Were you just talking about me?
Hi!
What is it?
It isn't?
Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
Oh, what is this? You got me something?
Look out the window, you'll see.
Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
No, Alec Berg.
No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
Like ...humm...How did she sound?
KRAMER!
I should have never left him alone.
You can't let him get away with that!
Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
Uh,
Grace?
No.
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.
The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
Hello?
Can he fix it?
(Let down) He didn't show.
Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
He tells him which soap to use.
I know, but he does.
We have to break up.
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
I said I'm sorry.
Yeah.
What? No Jerry, you have to go.
Why not?
David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
(admiring gasp) Fabulous.
What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
I guess.
It's a classic.
Later!
Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
Yea.
(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.
We'll see.
(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
(to self in head) This is unbelievable..
Yeah.
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
Get out!
Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
What's... medium?
When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
I don't know.
Bore-ing.
Ok.
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
This.
Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
Hmm.
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
G'night, Jugdish. (Laughs)
... me to go.
Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
(Passionately) Oh Bob! Bob!
Aww.
No, it's from the store.
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
What's your Problem?
Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
What? Calling people I hardly know, and demanding they return expensive gifts, that's my "thing"?
Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition.
You feeling jiff?
You have no idea?
I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
I like feet too. Im just saying
(To George) Stay away from her.
Can I fix that after lunch sir?
It is obtrusive, isn't it?
OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .
Kramer, the vest just called.
I am never gonna fall asleep.
Okay.
So, where's Todd?
Yeah.
Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.
Yup, you mean him?
No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
Oh, right. C'mon, don't you think they seem a bit too perfect?
Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
Ugh, the hell with 'em.
Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials)
What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
Dinner's good.
(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
No no - me first.
It,s, it's up to you.
It was an accident!
How about, it sucked?
It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
Do, do you?
Yeah.
Hey, did you get a massage yet?
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
Yeah, so?
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
Backless? Ya gonna back her in?
I don't want to see her naked.
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?
Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
I guess it was just a matter of time.
Well, I --
What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
Tia? Who's that?
A seemingly infinite supply.
Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
All right! You know what, just forget it!
A *lot* of weight. (enthusiastically)
Oh, nothin'.
I guess.
Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
Correct.
Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
No.
Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
Hey, have you ever fasted?
If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's why Carl said he had to get up early! Because I stink! Jerry, he thinks I have B.O.! Me!
Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?
No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
I am never going back to the movies again
I thought you were finished.
No, no, it does!
Ohh, what is the point?
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
How can they not put the air conditioning on?
Oh, what is this?
Who?
(quietly) Ahhhhh
He sat in mud. Not you.
(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
Twisted? God, I did you a favor.
Who was Pippi Longstocking?
Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
These aren't my keys!
He told you all that? How could he?
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
Why? What happened?
Oh, a puffy shirt.
Well, thank you father.
"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
Hi.
You don't always smell someone from a drink.
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
Youre afraid to sit next to a man. Youre a little homophobic, arent ya?
Right...
(nit) It's Susie.
There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is. They're baffled.
Oh, hi, Dad.
Alright, I'm heading over right now.
Yes indeed.
(uh-oh) Her?
Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as youre okay with it, its fine with me.
Keep following him.
all right then, where is it??
Do I know anyone??
Boy, he takes such a long time.
That is so ridiculous.
What?
Just get the car!
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
Aaron? Aaron are you ok?
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces
What are you doing here?
I didn't take your napkins.
So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
(dismayed) Ah, all o'--all of us?
You're talking too much!
I remember saying to myself, Why is Jerry so far off the base?
Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
(looks at it) TV Guide?
you can't spare it??
Oh, please.
Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
(pointing at the shoes) "What are those?"
Oh, you have to say something.
Kramer!
Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
(to Kramer) He took it out.
Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
All right, ha ha
Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
You gotta follow that car!
Sigh/Ugh.
Hello?
He'll be here.
What the--
Uh, you should be trying to save me!
I'm gonna faint...
C'mon
How kind of you.
The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
Oh, come on! You've dated women with nosejobs, what's the difference?
All right, what time do you want me back here.
Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
(Through intercom) Yeah.
So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
I did.
It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
(Accepting) Alright.
And he's dunking!
He's not my boyfriend.
Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?
Just read it!
No, he's not.
What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
Elaine.
What is this symbol?
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
Hey, it's me.
Oh!
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
I knew it! You're a regifter!
Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
What smell?
Yeah.
Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
What, Ocean.
Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
Really.
I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
What the hell was that?
Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
Ah, you don't have to tell me.
All right. Let's go, to Reggies.
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
Did you say goiter? What goiter?
Hey! Gail!
Hey, what do you think?
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
Ooh!
(to Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?
Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally.
Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
Kramer?
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
What did I say?
Oh, he's...he's a joy...
No it's not.
No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
You sure?
Oh, that's insane.
Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
There is no park and the team has relocated.
What?
He once spent a weekend with a woman.
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
You are!?!
I went to visit him.
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
(passing him the ketchup) Oh, sure.
No! I won't be a party to this.
Good day.
Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
What's `medium'?
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
What?
Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?
Do you mind?
Bye.
yeah, yeah
Uh...
I don't know, maybe.
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
Heh?
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.
Uhmm...
Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.
So what did he have to say?
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
Hello.
So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.
Huh?
George! It's cheating.
Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
No?
Any other time.
Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
Jerry, did you hear this? He couldn't eat for weeks...
Ha ha ha ha.
(pointing) Right here.
It looks good.
(breathy) Bye.
Ok, what time is your job interview George?
I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
I'm not in the mood.
(surprised) George!
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
Oh. (Leaves for the room)
Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.
I don't know.
Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
It is not necessary.
No, no, no! It *can't* be! I shampoo'ed! I rinsed! I repeated!
Whar about Kramer?
No. A general guy.
Malaysia?
You know...*the* move.
Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
I'm sorry.
Yeah, talked earlier.
Positive! This chick's playin' with confederate money.
Oh, baby.
How'd you manage that.
Hmm.. he's so nice! I'm really happy for them.
Yeah.
That's just because your a jackass.
Hello?
She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?
So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
I think he's got ideas.
Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah, really great.
No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.
Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
What are you talking about?
Well ...
So. What is she?
Hi, Michael!
Vincent?
I'm a "honey." He's pretty great, huh?
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
Ah hahaha hhuu ha (flirty laughing)
All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
I know I know. That is so ahh ......
my god, you didn't.
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
Yeah.
Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
So, its the same thing.
So what're you gonna do?
Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
What did you think, that would impress me?
I'm plumb out.
Oh, the date. The date.
Hi, it's me.
Hey. What's going on?
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
You could have.
Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
He thinks you're a phony?
Thought it would be nice.
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
I faked it.
Hey.
Really!?
And the bathroom in your apartment?
I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
How do you know?
With the car!
*Get* *out*!
85?
Oh, boy would I love to see that.
These things happen.
I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out.
Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
What's wrong with your shower?
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
Boy, you don't look good.
Oh, Great.
Melrose Place?
What did he do?
So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
Yeah.
Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.
Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
No. He said I didn't need a shot.
Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
Very much.
What would you wear?
Mulligatawny?
The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
What about this candelabra?
No! I won't!
Ok,
I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
Nelson.
(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
What woman?
Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back here again.
"I'm going to that!"
Oh, sure.
No I mean...Do you like him or do you like him like him?
Babu Bhatt did it.
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
I still smell!
Thanks.
Ah (hu ha - small laugh)
Somethings going on here.
I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
What, how did you know that?
(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
She.
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
Really!
Mmmm.
(shouts) HEY!!
Yeah, worked out good.
Kramer!
No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...
What do you think of the catalog?
Mmm, nice to meet you.
An Armani suit?
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
Well, you two'll have a great time there.
Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
My, my father?
oh is it two-ply? cause it it's two-ply I'll take one ply, one ply, one puny little ply, I'll take one measly ply
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
Ah...
Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.
Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
He asked me out for Saturday night.
(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.
ok, Jerry, I would be going out with him no matter what he looked like
Have you noticed she never laughs
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.
Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
Did you have a nice ride?
A fake number! Blimey!
Yes.
Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.
Him? Him who?
We'll see it Sunday.
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!
Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
I have a personal commitment.
Home.
(Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)
What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
Eh...he'll get up...
What's his problem?
Because it's really nobody's business.
Hmm.
No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
Uh huh.
Just me and George alone?
Ya.
You're giving him *ten* dollars?
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder.
What?
No, thats a big coincidence.
I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
What? What are you talking about?
You don't need us.
I was with David *Putty* last night.
Oh, pleeeeease. (moves to the living room and sits down)
Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
What?
(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
And what times the funeral?
Oh.
What's going on?
No, it could get sexual.
No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
What is that?
except for Jerry!(laughs)
No,
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
Shall we stop and say hi?
Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.
Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
I'm good.
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
Well eh, kind of....
[momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.
I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
Uh, no, thanks.
Vegetable Lasagna!
what is it?
Can I just have the name...
"War-- What is it good for?"!
No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
We're just, you know, having a good time.
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
(urgent) Jerry? Jerry?
Oh. Oh God.
Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
What?
Did you see that?
I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
Everybody knows. y'know George told me he thinks you're totally cute and everything.
Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
You took her medicine.
(exhales) They're going to be heroes.
What was that all about?
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
It's us.
I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
Jerry, are you free on Friday?
We didn't come in over there!
I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of your eggrolls.
I can't believe this!
What's me?
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
(pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.
Yeah
What--what did I say?
You want the money for the big salad, George?
Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
Dana Folley.
What are you doing?
What? KRAMER, I'll do anything.
What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.
He took it out.
Nice to meet you.
Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
(Getting up to leave) Alright.
... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
So where do you wanna eat?
What house guest?
Oh my god.
Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
What are you, yellow?
Oh, I can't believe this. What a dope! uh..excuse me umm.. I'm sorry this is.. this is kind of embarrassing but.. there's no toilet paper over here
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue.
Yes, I would say.
I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.
(gasps) I cannot believe this!
Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
I know.
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
Noreen, are you crying?
Yes! 915!
About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
Someone I know.
Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
Oh uh uh...
Well what happened when you raced him again?
(Mocking) Yeah, I'll chew on that.
How long have you two been together?
Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
Hey, when you walk him, do ya...
Jerry?
(Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
I'm afraid of dogs now.
Dogs. Oh I love dogs.
Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
What?
(impatient) Come on!
Good morning.
That's at the airport, right?
"Yeah! Mel Torm, That's his nickname."
I think it's unconscionable.
So then why are you seeing her again...
I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
what, what is going on? what.. who is Andre?
Well they're perfectly edible.
No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
(firm) No you didn't.
You didnt.
Oh, yeah.
You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
How much do you want for it?
But a few more dates and you can find out for yourself!
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
I don't think so.
I had this dream last night and you were in it.
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
Hey Drake! Hi Drake!
(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
(Yelling out) He's got nothin'!
Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
How's he gonna chew it?
Don't worry. We won't forget!
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.
Which one is he?
You're going to the Tony's too?
You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
(Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
Well, Fred asked me out.
Kramer?
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
Really?
I've got an alarm, ok?
I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate it.
Ah, I didn't know who he was!
EZ Bake oven?
oh yeah, oh.. like you're one to talk
I thought you wore silk underwear.
Hey boys!
Jerry, give him the keys back.
Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.
Yep.
No?
I'll see you.
Hello?
yeah, Tony says you better step off George
Uuuhm, all the time.
Hey, what do you think of this?
Nope.
Oh...(falls in to the sofa.)
Casus belli.
Yes it is
Ya
I gotta go talk to him.
Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
Yeah..heheah (laughing a bit)
The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.
Right, well...
Yeah? Well, so am I!
Come on, what is taking you so long?
Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
It works.
You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
Well, either way
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
Oh, yeah.
Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
I met him.
Here.
So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
Who wouldn't taste a pie?
What is so funny?
I don't know. What do you think?
Is that with the parts and labor?
(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
No, milk.
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
Hey, how's your hair?
She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.
What? A health plan?
What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
Right... (nodding)
Oh, all right.
(to self in head) Bizarro world..
Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
Uh... I...
I wish I could quit...
Hey, what's this? Look. A wallet.
Good for you.
What's that?
What's wrong?
No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
So, how is a guy like you not involved?
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
All right. Witness? (looks at George).
Yeah
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
No, no! We'll find a space. There's spaces in the other lot.
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
Yup.
Get a hold of yourself!
Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...
Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.
Oh, yeah, but I didnt say I hated anyone who had one.
Yep! just you and Kramer.
We talked about that already.
What? What do you need a rope for?
Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
Well, uh, fan. My father--
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
Your guy can't cross to my side?
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
Oh, GREAT!
Oh, Mr. Pitt.
Oh, I know. Theres a weak shower spray, I know. Ive already thought about it, and Im switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, Why stand when you can sit? Maybe Ill get some rubber duckies.
Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
The remote goes through the bubble?
Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
How can you even consider not going?
What is wrong with everybody?
Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
Did you ever hear of...holding it in?
Well...
Yeah, how's the doctor date?
Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.
How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around, see what dishes look good.
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.
So what happened?
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
Why?
But I really enjoy dancing.
Hey, Joe Mayo.
It's a hair.
How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
Why dont you just ask her parents?
Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
930
What is a wig master?
Jerry, look at my fish.
So. Mom and Pop's plan was to move into the neighborhood...establish trust...for 48 years. And then, run off with Jerry's sneakers.
Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!
Go talk to her.
What did I do?
That's what I said.
(Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?
Oh, no! Come on Jerry.
Yeah.
(big smile) Okay.
It's not such a bad name.
Hi, Greg.
Okay, okay. Rule Number Two. Spending the night is optional!
What's your line?
Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
You gotta do me a favor.
Yeah, right.
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
Hey, what are you doing?
So, whatd she say?
Where?
Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
(Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.
hates it
Hi Sheila.
Is that tomorrow?
Is he happy?
Hey Jerr...
My leg looks pretty bad.
Again you are telling me to shut up?
Because, it is what she does.
Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
Really?
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
I'm looking for Kramer.
Cause then I could move in here.
He has to go. He may have killed her.
But you said it was in the store!.
Well, I, for one, really respect that.
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
How was it?
so huh, what did the doctors say?
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
But, Jake, I didn't...
Right on baby. (???)
Justin Pitt?
No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
Hey.
There's a feather in your cap.
Uh huh.
yeah, well I just hope I run into her again ok, cause I will never forget that flinty voice, it is tattooed in my brain if I hear it, watch out So listen what happened with Jane last night?
Bye.
What?
Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
Hey.
So how long did they drag you?
No, we just met...
You look a little stressed.
No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen You ran out of underwear, you cant leave the house.
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.
What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
After one date!
No, no, it's okay.
Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?
Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
Hi, Mr. Lippman.
I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
(sees racquet) Could I ...
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
Hi! Hey, have you gotten your present yet for the Drake?
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
(to everyone) Oh, that's the Mohel.
So... impudent.
uhn... Sorry!
What?
Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
Jerry!
The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
Mmm
Oh, my God... The Mohatma?
What?
They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
Hey, dont forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight oclock.
Some house, huh?
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
It's right over there.
Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.
It doesn't matter.
I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
Mr. Costanza, I,
"Ha...."
Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)
Since when do you wear cologne?
Hi.
David, um, I..
Jerry. Oh there - -
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
C'mon.
That was nothing.
What is that?
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
Uh, my father's half drunk. ha ha ha ha
Boy, I am really starting to dislike the Drake!
toilet paper
There's some kasha.
(To Jerry) You tell him.
(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
No. We were both in the mood for one.
Yeah.
They were stolen.
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
(not sure) I guess.
Cmon lets go...
It's for George.
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
Yes.
All right! I am back in the game.
Oh, yeah. What's that called?
(frustrated) Just go.
Oh, gimme a break..
Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.
(gleeful) The fish!
Here in this little apartment?
I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.
Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
Oh, hi Greg.
(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
I can't believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?
Well, they're not kept in little cages.
That's the janitor closet, across the street.
Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
(Mock sympathy) Well.. David, it happens.
(she fakes a strangling) RRR...
Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
(sits beside Jerry) What?
I have to live in a cave.
Uh-huh.
Did he give you a reason?
Shouldnt you be out on a ledge somewhere?
I'm marchin' in.
What's the matter?
No, I really don't want to.
(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
Robin? No, why?
Heres your plane ticket.
I really like the city.
I know.
He's not THAT religious.
Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
Whats that?
He's good.
I told ya'. He has ideas.
Ohh.. my..
Cheryl Miller's brother?
get, um, started..
Chilly out.
Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?
Oh, Hi.
All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
I guess I'm... Lois Loan.
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
I gotta go. (Hangs up.)
(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
Let go of my tongue!
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
What about Georgie?
What?
Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
Can you believe this woman?
Oh I didn't tell anyone.
You can't! You can't do this now!
Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
Oh, it's been a while.
You pick it up?!?
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
Hi, Toby.
He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
Yeah, that's him.
What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
I'm going to order Chinese Food.
Isn't he the best?
Really, like when?
Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go.
Well, what did you intend, Hal?
Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?
Do you think I should call him and apologize?
Faux pas?
Here's a thought - Bye bye.
(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
Yeah, I suppose.
Yeah. I know. Me, too.
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.
Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?
Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
yeah.
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?
(To Anna) Get in the car.
(exhales)
hey
Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.
Do you think it's a coincidence?
Yeass.
Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
What?
Hi, (sighs) you got the organizer?
Oh, the remote! Okay, I'm just gonna put it on top of the television...
Why?
Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
Um...as far as I know.
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
Um uh.
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
No, I don't want this anymore.
Yeah, like a swoosh.
I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
(intercom) it?s me!
(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
This is my bike!
Why?
A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
Okay, you came to pick me up at...
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
Really? What're the other titles?
Ready.
Oh...hi, Sidra -
Oh.
What? No, its not a big deal.
Are you OK? What? What?
Sure - the video.
yeah
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
He did.
hey you got a problem with Tony?
Na.
Manuscript?
Really? A fight with the foreman?
Hey, a pretty good idea, huh?
Well...
(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.
I think it's a mistake.
Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
A fur?
Yeah, but come on . . .
(gasps) How did you find it?
Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
Mr Peterman, you...
I'll pay for it.
It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)
[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
We did. We're just hanging out.
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
He's a human maraca.
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
(looking in her purse) Oh, here.
Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.
It's PLO blend.
Yay!
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
What does he do?
Oh...I don't think so.
Great, great.
[exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.
Nope.
Dam
Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
What is that?
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
(annoyed) Aww, nuts!
Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?
Ohh... its snowing. Its beautiful.
50
Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.
Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
Congratulations! You passed!
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
Right. African.
What kind of shopping?
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
Well, that's your problem.
(Shocked) Stabbed?!
I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
Now listen Roy, tell me something. When, are you gettin' out of here?
Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
Mmm.
There was a bit of an accident.
Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
Kramer, what are you doing here?
Shut up...
And I said I hadn't seen her.
(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
Dumb and lazy, I understand.
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
No.
No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)
Its great to... talk about... other people...
Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
Right! In fact... No, never mind...
He's on with a Chinese woman.
What else?
They took Babu away?!
Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
Disappointed?
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
I thought you had done this before.
They were?
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
no no , ..
He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.
I mean, I can't give people orders!
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
Both of the them.
Hi.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?
What guy?
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
What?
No.
Why cant you sit in the middle?
Uh huh.
Why not?
(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
George! [waves hi]
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
[gives up] Yeah, exactly...
This, that, and the other.
Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
I didn't hear anything.
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
Just hold on!
"Who's the Drake"?
You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
Hey Kramer, Kramer!
Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
... and biking and ..
What?
I know.
Ha hum...Do you like George?
(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
So, what did you say?
Who?
Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
Yeah, so they say.
(happy gasp) Oh.
did you have fun
Get out! What'd you do?
I - I work for your mail order catalog.
Why?
Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.
Is he black?
So what?
Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
Why?
Alright, send him up here.
No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
The kitchen?!
(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
Oh, hi. I'm Elaine. (Gets up to shake Sidra's hand, but stumbles and falls "right into them.")
What am I gonna say?
(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
I can't go.
Happy Festivus, Georgie.
It's brug-wa (?).
I got what you asked.
Get out!
Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!
It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
That's the emergency?
Hey!
I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
Hey
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
O.K. O.K. Remy.
What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
Set.
Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
So what?
No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
Yeah. That's right.
Ah come on
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
Yeah sure.
I am speechless. I am without speech.
YES! yes. You saw him on TV.
Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
Dad thinks George is gay.
You are kidding.
Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. Get well, get well soon we want you to get well.
We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
What? Clinging to some scraps?
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
So?
What?
Everybody does. Bye-bye....
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
Shhhhhh. Here.
Ah, this. And that.
I know.
What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
Fine!
Oh, I
Yeah! hmmm..I gotta go..
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
What tell? What's a tell?
excuse me, do you have a tissue?
Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..
Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!
Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
It's disgusting.
No.
He schnapped me.
Yeah, you met her when we were going out.
No, I'm sure you do.
Oh, mine's "Ike".
Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
what?
(Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?
(SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?
(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
(to Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. Hes the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request-
No, thats too much money to borrow.
Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
Hi.
So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.
I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
Who is it?
Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.
No.
[laughing]
Give me the money.
Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
3 squares? you can't spare 3 squares??
Well, I'm so sorry! I-
Wait a second wait a minute, You jealous of him or you jealous of me?
Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha
I don't have a boyfriend.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
Ring Dings?
Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
Oh my God. You're crying.
You can't beat a babka.
I need those clubs.
Shut up! I think he's on to us.
(angry shout) Kramer!
Oh she's fat?
I would love to go upstairs.
Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
Hi.
Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!
What's with him?
You ditched the fur?
I'm sure you could.
No, Chinese.
Oh yeah? How'd you do?
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
Ill be right back.
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
Hiiii Kramer
Great... [To herself] Help me...
Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.
(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
Ill hang this phone up right now!
What if a handicapped person needs it?
Well, why didn't you say no!!
Well, no, I would hardly--
You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
What did who say?
You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in over with. It's just a movie.
Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
You what?
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
What? Why not?
How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
No, but that's one problem. Why?
Huh.
Hi.
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
I was just kiddin, around.......
You know, that button looks very familiar.
Bravo!
Well, uhm... I...
Yeah. What, is it a problem?
As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
Did he get it?
Right there.
Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.
How did you do that?
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
I'll bet they were even in on it.
Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?
(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans.
YOU feel?
You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
Hi!
Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.
Statute.
(accepting) Okay, okay.
Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
huh (smiles) but huh, in this medicated haze, in this woozy state, um do you recall the words.. radical reconstructive surgery being uttered?
I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
Answering machine.
I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
What if it's your hair?
Yeah, I called him Maestro.
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
Yeah, yeah, that too.
Oh god.
Where did that come from?
Jerry!
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
What?
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
All right, we're done here.
Hear what?
(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
Then how did she find out, Jerry?!
Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
 Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!
Uh.. I?m Elaine!
What is that?
(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
I'll have a cinnamon babka.
Prognosis... negative.
Hi.
No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
Yes, she's a dermatologist.
(not amused) All right.
You don't have the label maker, do you?
Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
Su-sie?
(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
HI
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
Yessiree Bob.
Hey!
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
Yeah.
There you are!
What a sale, huh? And how about that store, delivering it tonight? We're gonna be swimming in 'thank you's...
I think I can tell.
George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
So, what's that?
The K Man did it!
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me.
Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
What is the problem?
That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
Nothing.
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
Sorry. Hello?
So? How was it?
Hi.
Can we do this later, George?
Can you believe him?
Yeah. It's surprising.
C'mon..
(Leaving Jerry) See ya.
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella and make mah own pie!
Come on, lets go do something. I dont wanna just sit around here.
What's the status?
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
You're welcome.
We try.
But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
Maybe it's the cold weather.
What is wrong with Ned?
Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
He's in.
Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine.
(Casually playing along) So what?
Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
Jerry, Jerry.
Yeah, I am so sorry.
What is the difference?
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
Well, she wants you to like her.
Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
What kind is that?
You're lucky I don't report you...
Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.
No, I'm not. Here you go.
I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...
Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
We should be able to get across right through here!
No, No...
Well, what is it?
Wow, look at that ring.
(Interested) Oh?
Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?
I turned him. He defected.
Well, he looks like a man.
Why can't he play for us?
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
Me either.
Yeah.
(to Kramer) Yeah, so?
Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
It's okay, you don't
It's almost stupid if we didn't.
Why do I keep setting you up?
(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.
Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
Well, nobody *told* me that!
Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
Oh really, you like 'em?
What, is that a rule?
Can I offer you anything to drink?
This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
I like your little bag.
Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
When's Rachel comin' out?
You're nuts!
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
I got a date.
(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
So, you think you're sponge-worthy?
No, no, come on Michael!
What do you mean bald?
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
Phoenix? Whats happening with his appartment?
Alright, Im out of here.
Oh, probably caught in traffic.
(Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.
Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
They have a big salad.
Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
What, Uh oh?
Open your vault.
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
Hello?
Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
What?
Oh Kramer. (They embrace)
Well, you know, I...
Oh! (tries to take paper)
How are you gonna widen the lanes?
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
But we need you.
Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
Mmm, gyro.
(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?
Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
(surprised) Brett? Everything alright?
Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
Aaalright!
What?
All right. Whiff away.
Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
I'm in looove!
Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
You're eye still hurts?
Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
(surprise) Hey, what're you guys doing here?
Well, she can't keep it, it's not fair, that's *our* TV!
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
Come on, he's on his own, come on!
(pause) What do you mean?
What?
You get yours out, I was here first!
No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
You're all grown up.
That's because I thought you were black.
Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last months security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.
Copywriter.
Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
Uh, who else?  Mookie. Mookie was there. Do you know him?
What is it?
Oh no.
Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
Thank you. Ow!
(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
Oh, sure.
What about George?
Really?
(Looking up from a menu) Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!
Oh yeah? Can I see it?
I have no idea.
He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
I think so.
Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh)
yeah, all right ok
He's got a back problem.
Yeah!
Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.
This is Aaron.
So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
You have no idea.
It's Elaine.
That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
Oh hi, Sue Ellen.
Anyway, so how was the dinner?
Mm hmm.
(resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman.
So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
You got any room on that thing?
Elaine Benes.
I wonder what happened?
Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and attractive. Y'know Jerry, you should buy some of his art. That would really lift his spirits.
Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
You're telling me.
(worry) Oh no. What?
Yeass.
Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
What if.
Oh! really.
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
No. What about him?
Well, she has it!
But she broke up with you.
What is the matter?
Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
Do you see it or don't you?
Now?!
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
Eleven-thirty?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
Me? Why me?
Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
Well, no point in wasting $1,200.
These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.
Judy, hi, listen...
What's goin' on?
Yeah, who's he?
How ya doin'?
Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know.
No Mister Peterman.
Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
What's up?
Should I do it, George?
My roommate has Lyme disease.
Fish don't feel any pain.
Oh.
Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
Yeah.
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
Oh.
You weasels!
(to George) Mm-hmm.
Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
Oh, hi Dan.
Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
What exactly was that kid?
Yeah, especially those frames.
Yeah?
Uh-hu. And do you know what happened?
Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
What?
Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.
Oh, thanks. I've got plans.
Yeah. (sits down next to Susan)
(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
Of course there's a community.
Oh, boy, I'm really scared!
Three days.
You got me cash?
Theyre coming in?
It's me.
Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
Get movin'...
Oh, fantastic.
Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
(accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you.
Uh,
Oh...my God.
Jerry...
Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)
Oh, he's fine.
What happened to Bob Saccamano?
It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
Ah.
What's that?
The Drakette took it.
Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
Deal with it. Be a man!
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
Oh, Maestro.
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
Quiet! So where is this Sophie?
He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
Didnt work, huh?
Why? Is it irrevocable?
What's the difference?
Aha ha ha (laugh)
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
Well, have they called the police yet?
Oh, could you please hurry?
What d'you think?
Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
What? Was it something I said?
I still don't see what the big deal is.
You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
What is it?
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
I realize that.
Twenty sponges should be plenty.
Why does he do that?
Well what, what about your fact-checking job?
In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
Sure.
Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
So, what did he do?
Ever.
(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.
I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!
All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.
All right. Let's do it.
I beg to differ.
Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
here, take it
Okay! Okay! Okay, I will talk to him. (Kramer enters.)
(Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
But what??
I touched 'em.
George, I cannot believe...
Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
I can't tell you.
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
I don,t think so.
What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
Hello father.
(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.
I think your um ... (points at the phone)
You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
Balloon bouquet? For who?
Come on, don't be a baby.
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
Right, Joe Divola
Well, I couldn't help it. "Moland Spring"?
Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
Should you be smoking?
Alright, let's go, come on.
I attend to his personal affairs.
Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
(sighs) So 10 to 14 months.
No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
He'd just be touching your back.
(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!
But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)
Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
Really? You really think I should fire her?
Then why are we calling?
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
All right, I'm gonna go.
This is nice. What kind of car is this?
w-What is this all about?
You said it was an emergency.
Just gimme your keys.
No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
Oh!
"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
Hey.
I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
So what do you have to say for yourself?
Hey.
What did you have to say that for?
Yeah.
It's BOOKED Jerry!
What? What did I do?
God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
Uh hu.
Well it did occur to me.
So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
what happened to his face, tell me, what happened to his face
I don't know. Chuck it?
No. I'll just walk home.
Yes, exactly.
Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
Real good!
Hey.
So? Then what?
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
Have you seen the card?
Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
Why?
All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
I've never seen you jealous before.
Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
Why?
Wha... W.. Are you going home?
That was two months ago.
Oh my God!
(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
So you don't know anything?
If I was saying something I would have said it.
Do you go in the shower?
What happened?
I don't know if I can.
Yeah.
You encouraged her to get one.
I dont have five thousand dollars.
So did you hear this message?
Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.
Why do you keep watching?
(making a face) "Moland"?
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
What shoving?!
Yeah.
But he's okay?
Right.
You're a taking person.
No, who?
"Well, what kind of shirt was it.?"
Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
What? What are you trying to say, George?
No, No that's my purse!
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
We know the terrain.
Oh my god.
Oh.
No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry.
Yeah, I know.
Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I think you need a degree.
Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
Yes, his name is Hal.
Oh, god! Let us out!
What?
What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
I don't mind skunk.
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
It's Elaine Marie Benes.
Yeah.
Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O" went from the valet's "B", to the car, to me. It clings to everything. Jerry thinks it's an entity. But I showered and I shampoo'ed, so...
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
What don't you know?
See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
George!
So what if I do? (heads for the door)
It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
I don't blame ya'
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
Malaysia. I was in the area.
(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
So the trip was good?
Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
I didn't say it.
You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
I don't understand. Before you were jealous of me. Now you're jealous of him?
How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
Eat your soup!
Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
Why?
Okay.
The flight's been canceled?!?!
Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing)
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Well,
Pal? You think I'm your pal?
You're getting warm.
No, hes driving back to Maryland tonight.
you would not believe what just happened to me in the bathroom
Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
(fierce) I will!
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
Why did you introduce me to your parents?
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
Well, at least you're not bitter.
(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
(laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)
"Hey Jimmy!!"
You haven't told them yet, have you?
Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
So you're giving him a discount too?
Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Cant you have coffee with people?
Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.
(bearing up) I'm fine.
My back hurts.
Yknow, um, you could use a little work on your manners.
In about twenty minutes.
So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you out for a *big* meal because *you* are getting *too* thin...
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
"He thinks you're mentally challenged."
Well then what?
Where are you going?
(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
My God this is fantastic! Tell me, were you guys just blown away or what?
(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
Why not?
What?
Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
I can't have popcorn for dinner!
Is there a table ready?
Nothing, and I've looked.
Did you and Patty just break up?
What?
What?
Well... the counter...was right there, and...
Well I, I don't know.
You can pick 'em up right now.
You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?
Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?
(makes an irked noise)
Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
How is it talking?
What's he look like?
What's to discuss?
Who is it?
(looking for support) Jerry!
Babs?
Me?
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
(hopeful) And?
oh wait, you're giving me a lift home right?
Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
Yeah...Jake Jarmel.
He's guarding a suit?
Just give it back to him.
"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
O.K., fine, I have...no grace.
You can't tell me?
Ohh!
Really....but I barely know you.
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
What? Who told you that?
Hi.
Hmm!
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
I dont know.
Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
Well, uh, I'll cancel it.
Yes.
Yes! 212.
Ghandhi?
Why couldn't he be a dunker?
Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
Aha hu, You look *terrific*.
First the sucking then the weaning.
Mm! To get what?
Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
They make it longer?
This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
(disappointed) Oh.
Yeah.
A big coincidence.
What were your.. demands?
Hey, does he ever talk about Superman?
Oh! my God.
Yeah!
"Join the club."
Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
Alright, alright.
It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
(hands them over) You can have 'em.
Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
In the office.
But it's Saturday.
OK. I dont quite know
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
Oh, how's the baby?
(like a little girl) Okay...
Yeah.
Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?
Yeah.
No, I don't think so.
Hi.
Boy, I'm really sweatin.' Good sweat, beads of sweat...sweatin' bullets. (Notices Sidra.) Look at her. I don't need to see her naked to know those aren't real. Why does she need to tie the towel around her? She's got a rack on her chest. (Sidra takes her towel off and lies down.) Oh god! Sidra's takin' the towel off! (Looks at Sidra's chest.) Whoa, doctor! That's it, I knew it! I knew it, they're definitely fake.
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
Hey.
We're going out tomorrow night.
Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
Yes, yes.
For this couch?!
Oh, no...that won't last.
No. I can't smell it.
What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
Yeah.
Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
Yeah. (startled)
Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
Not getting along?
You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?
The hit and run!
Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,
Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
Because they're turning your teeth green?
I don't want to keep him waiting...
She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
There's nobody I can go with.
No.
(noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?
You want one?
(Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.
I'm going down there.
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
Hey, Puddy.
What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
For nothing..
Uh huh.
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
What?
Uh, aw, KL5-239O.
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
Not good. I'm a moron.
Alright, that's enough of this.
Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
So was Mia Farrow there?
It.
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
No.
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
(with pain) Hi Evelyn.
Anna...
"How so?"
Some friend of his from England.
So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?
Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
Ten minutes.
How'd it go? George?
A pleasure.
I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
He's not my boyfriend.
If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
What do you want!?
Oh, that sounds... romantic.
Why are they doing this?
Yeah.
I don't know!
(pause) Well... Can I talk to her?
. . . What does that mean?
Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
(Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?
Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
Yeah, yeah, right.
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
Well if you want it, you get it.
Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
That's a rat hat?
Are you?
(gets Kramer's point) Hah.
Do you hear something?
Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
Just me and George?
(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
They're signing the papers next week.
Your old high school hangout? Why?
How ya feeling?
(quietly) Give that to me.
Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.
Which one is he?
Yes! I'm a writer.
The roommate's.
(Sourly) I'll make a note of it.
What are you doing here?
What?
Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
Oh
Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?
See ya'.
Things occur to me from time to time.
Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
That's okay.
Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
How dare you!
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
I wish I was dead.
What do you got, a cucumber?
Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
Nice to meet you, too!
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
I'm having people over.
A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
Hi!
(Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?
No, but there was nobody sitting here...
Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
Hi. (she flips her hair)
Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
Fine, go away.
Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
Is that the right word?
Really?
A bubble?
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!
You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
You mean lying to your uncle?
It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
That's good...
She gave it to charity.
Go.
Who wants cupcake?
Wha--?
What? I can't hear you.
Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
(to Kramer) ...Kramer.
We're down here! Help!
Could you put it in a big bowl?
Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Siena?
Oh come on.
Seriously, we don't.
Head to toe.
Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
I thought I was alone.
What happened, what took you so long?!
I really think it's the size of your neck.
You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?
Who's Reilly?
What? Just 'cause of that?
Ned must have left it here.
Ilene.
Oh, hi, Frank.
anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.
No, no, not Putumayo.
A Ziggy?
Oh ya.
Well, it's just two hours by plane...
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
I know.
Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
No, get-get off my purse!
Oh uh, I dont really eat dessert. Im dieting.
Hey, what if he's married?
Good luck.
Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
What are you talking about?
Really? Wow.
Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
Well, a lot of it is vegetable...
Exactly.
I'm not surprised.
I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.
(To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
I had no idea you had this kind of money.
(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
Make it three hundred.
(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
What extremities?
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
Her too.
A what?
This is it. Wish me luck.
And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
I offered them 25, they had no idea...
I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
That sounds urgent...
Uhh. No George!
All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
Hmmm?
Oh I did?
Did you try the cigarettes?
Great music.
Hello. This is Todd Gack.
(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
(Embarrassed) Free sub.
Yes, she's very upset.
A cookie!
Wow, this is soft suede.
You got it?
(to another passenger) Huh. You believing this?
(shouting up) Jerry! Jerry!
Then why didn't you take it?
It's ironic.
(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!
Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
H-his name?
Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.
Oh, congratulations
What's that?
Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
(to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.
Hey!! I found out from Paula; She likes George. I'll bet he'll be relieved.
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
So what?
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.
Terrific.
So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What times your game?
(shouts) I hate it!!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?
I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
You're a baby!
So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.
I'm not going for this, Kramer should go! It was all his idea!
What do they do?
Street toughs took my armoire?
I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.
No. In what way?
Hey Paula!.. I hear you been going out with George Costanza?
Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
I know, I know, I was unbelievable
You were?
Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
So, George... did you get the chair?
I hate the counter.
Aren't you Raquel Welch?
Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
Seattle.
What? How?
I've always loved ... United Airlines.
Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
A wedding?
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
Ooohh.
You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
Sssshhhhhh!!!
Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
"Why?"
Ah.
It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
No, no, he's not my boyfriend.
How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
Must have been an accident...
Who is it?
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
Im doing great.
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
Yeah, she'll be here any second.
Where were you today?
86th and Broadway please.
Cmon, you cant do anything about it. The cops wont do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why dont you just forget it?
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
During Schindler's List?
Why not?
Raquel Welch!
(shocked) What?
(weary) Jerry!
Just imports? No exports?
(disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
Where's my water?
Ha, I didn't mention it.
Ohhh!
yeah.
Jerry?
Well, um, he, he got fired.
7.0
Yeeeahh!!!
``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
What is that stain [on my coat]?
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
I wouldn't be comfortable.
Why?
Seems to be.
He's sixty-six years old.
OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
Well...
(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
Well I don't care. It was delicious.
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.
What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
It's nothing.
What?
(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
I just don't enjoy being with him.
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
Listen, was Russell at the casting?
(dumbfounded) No.
Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
No problem.
These are terrible.
What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
Well do you have any in a... size four.?
Yeah.
Really?
(mouths silently) That's perfect!
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
(Blunt, to the point) No.
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
They drove away?
You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
Me, either!
Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms...
Isn't that a little racist?
Alright. Forget it!
It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
he's supposed to get the bandages off on Sunday.. what if?
I know.
I heard him contend that.
Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
I'm waiting.
People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have you noticed that?
George is on his way up.
Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)
(Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
(sitting down in the booth) 'Kay.
You got me an apartment in the building?!
Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.
They have big salads.
I can't do it.
She stopped performing.
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
Who is he?
Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
Mrs. Oliver?
George?
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
Uh uh
No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
I can't say that.
I've got that magazine article for you.
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.
But he used a condom, right?
Well maybe you should ask him!
Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
What?
(head in arms) I know--
(quietly) I can cancel.
Well, who's gonna call?
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
Really? Can you really take a picture?
"Elaine, ya gotta have a baby." Ugh.
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
I Like Her!
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
(Agreeing) Mm.
I *love* the Drake.
I just didn't know you watched that.
Yeah.
Mmm. De-lish.
Oh, it stinks.
Is that good?
Okay, whatre we doing here? I have seen everything.
Cocktail flu.
It's garbage.
Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?
(meekly) Yes ma'am.
think Tony, think
That's not gonna do anything.
We certainly have.
What happened? What took you so long?
(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
Thanks
The astronauts use them.
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
Well maybe you should call him.
Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
No no, I wanna go.
(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
Yep.
Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
(dry) I put her stats on the back.
Nana?
Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
What did you say?
Well, wait---wait a second.
Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
Do you have twenty bucks?
I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.
Hello.... hello, oh...
Ugh!
(same time as Jerry) --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--
And then he starts writing on my chart.
And you're taking...
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
the four of us are going out Saturday right? That should be fun
You're way off.
3 squares!! that's all I was asking for! 3 squares!
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
I think I might.
She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
AHhh. Thank you.
Well I trust people not to do that.
I cut it.
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
Wanna sit down?
It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
I didn't say anything.
George...
Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase. He walks tward the door) Where are you going?
I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
I'll go to Paris.
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
What, are you insane?!
George, are you going to put her on the phone?
Steve.
Yeah
Uh. Does he live underwater?
Id do it but I dont have any money.
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. (steps down)
OK I'll see you later.
I know!
Call an ambulance.
Yes. He's one of those bounders.
(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.
Yeah, he did.
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
Ah, I know. I know...!
I know!
Hi boys.
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
(Between chuckles) How is she?
Well use a paper towel.
Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.
I guess I'll just--
I had the roast beef
Reggies? I can't eat anything there.
Are you calling me a liar?
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)
No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.
But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
(saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!
What are you doing in here with that?
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
(dryly) Yeah, too bad.
Oh...
When do you take this exam?
Oh, very nice.
Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big picnic tables there?
What?, uh?
(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.
Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)
(grasping the concept) Ohh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I looked for you too, I was all the way over on the side
Yes.
Bark.
How do you do that?
My, George this must have cost a fortune.
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
Five thousand dollars? I dont have five thousand dollars.
*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
(to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?
So?
(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
Yeah, of course.
What was that?
Watch out for that maroon Golf.
Jerry, we don't have time for this...
Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?
George, come on! I'll pay for you.
Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.
Fine.
Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.
(gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
What are you doing here?
We've got a good team.
Who's Sally?
Well.
(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.
Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
There is no he.
Yeah, Im gonna work on that
Oh, see, this is the problem.
Winona is a Native American.
You've put a lot of thought into this, haven't you?
I don't have a fax machine.
Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?
Oh, I'm not, uh...
I've got to go
So, thats why were not together anymore.
(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?
All I've got is grape juice.
Oh thats nothing. Um and anyway um
Wow! That was great! That show was so funny. It was really funny. I'm not just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.
Oh, Please.
Wow, invitations again...
Nice looking family.
Yeah? Like what?
Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
Yeah, see ya.
(frustration) Ugh!
Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
(to Myra) He's very highly recommended. So...
Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
It's possible.
Hello, darling.
Aren't you?
Well, I am the President.
(grabbing Puddy) What are you doing?
His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
So, I understand youre moving to Phoenix?
Ah, well.
Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
You know I really hate my clothes.
No.
Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
Would you just, let it go?
huh, Mine's 145.
He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. Theyre in my short story class with Roxanne and me.
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
Yeah.
Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?
Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
Wow...
Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
You were snooping.
Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
Really?
How do you know that?
You missed quite a performance.
What?
Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
Yeah, it's all taken care of.
Oh, well I have to eat.
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
Mmmnn, Georgie!
Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take it!
No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
Ninety-nine percent sure?!
Well it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.
Relax--
You found a hair in your Farina?
Yeah, it got pretty nasty.
Ok.
So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
Oh my!
I've never seen her before.
What do I need this for?
Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.
(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
Exactly.
You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how Im actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.
So what are you going to do?
What?
You got something on your mind?
My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
Just, very interesting.
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
Isn't it going the other way?
What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
Fine! Were through!
This was my idea you stole my idea.
Will you shut up? I can't hear!
Sure. Water Pik, floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
Why don't I give you my phone number?
No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
She sent you a Christmas card?
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
Hey, we told you not to park there!
What is this?
My God, are you okay?
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
(improvising) I said, uh, some snuggly baby.
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
Yeah, yeah!
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
My back.
Whoa! Whoa!
How did you know?
Oh, no. Don't!
uh.
Cherry Binaca, it?s new.
And... what would those be?
Yeah.
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
Karate?
That's it?
(triumphant) Ha, ha, ha ha!
Well what do you want to give him, change?
Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
(stretching) Oh Man... Uunh.
Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)
Yeah, that's right!
Uh, no, I'm OK.
Come on up.
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
Do you want some of mine?
Yeah. It is kind of cool.
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
What are you doin' there?
You got a comfort problem there?
uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
Oh! boy.
Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.
(Suddenly angry) What?!
Hi!.
Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
You sure you don't mind?
Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?
Anyway...they're real.
Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
No.
Im going to get some popcorn.
You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
Even though what?
Hey, Arnie's just as upset.
Yeah.
Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
Oh. So, you're pretty religious?
Hello!
No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.
We'll have to sleep head to toe.
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
Yes it is!
I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
See, now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?
Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
Oh.
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
(listening) A little.
Ellis and Alex aren't even close.
(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
You lie.
(engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm.
Then how come we're not moving?
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.
Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
Ohio?
What about the dogs?
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
I dont know.
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
I thought my idea was just as good.
Ahh.
George?
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
Oooh no, I don't think so.
Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine)
Oh, god.
No, no, unfocus.
I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
All right, you can take it. But I want it back.
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
Anybody here? Peterboy?
(Shrugging it off) eh.
(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
Yeah, me too.
(warning) Jerry.
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
No, no. Im fine.
Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.
Uh, his name, um, I don't - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
We don't walk that fast...
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
It's that bad?
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
But we were here ahead of you.
What?
Hi, Thank you so much for recommending me to Viking Press .
"Aaaaaahhh! He is?!"
I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe its just a coincidence.
No. Why would you think that?
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
hell-oo
(at the same time) Yes, yes.
Oh no.
Mm-Hmm.
*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
Plan B? There is no plan B.
Yeah. Definite moisture.
JERRY Cosmo?
What?
We're with him, we're with him.
This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
Is this Noreen?
And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
Hey!
Kramer!!
Consomm, hmm.
Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
What d'you care?
Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I havent seen my father in a while and... you know...
Okay.
(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
Hey.
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
Oh, cristal clear!
Hi.
(extemporising) Uh... chips.
Kramer...
How do you feel?
Of course Id pay you back..
What?
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
What letter?
I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
Alison! Hi, this is Elaine...
Oh, did you check you machine?
Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
What's so funny
Got to *love* the Drake!
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
What's the difference?!!
Yeah! It's a social thing.
(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
"What are you..crazy?"
You're soo good lookin'.
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
Oooohh, what about me!
(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
Hi.
Is that something?
(giggling) Oh.
Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
Why are you talking about my shoes?
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
No, of course not.
Throw down your key.
(Shrugging it off) Oh, please.
Peach.
Okay, this is quite a place.
Oh c'mon, Newman.
Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?
I dropped a grape.
It was..uh.. John-John.
right yeah.. no I mean did they get into stuff like a.. long jagged scars or.. gross deformities, major skin grafts, stuff like that
Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
I got some for you.
Hey.
uh?
(sarcasm) Alright, good job.
Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.
Hey.
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
Brett?
Jerry, He's A GUY!
Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?
Hello.
Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
Fine.
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
I thought George was meeting us here?
(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...
No.
I believe that's the new minimum wage.
(To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.
What'd I say?
It's Joe Mayo's coat.
(OC) It's me.
Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's all so boring..
Worked?
Over you?
Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
Huuh, Wow.
Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
(forcing a smile) Hi.
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
Well, it's just a first draft!
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
What?
Katra?
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.
(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
Nooo.
Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
Uuhhh.
It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
No no, no no.
So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
Thank you very much.
What's going on?
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.
Hey.
Vincent?
Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
Fine. (laughs)
Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)
You are amazing.
Ooooh, please.
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
'Oooh, and that coffee table is saying, put some coffee on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from "The Price Is Right"! (demonstrates a winner on "The Price Is Right")
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
What?
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
(on intercom) It's Elaine.
Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
Is anything wrong?
Why? Why were you so embarrassed?
(pause) Oh. That's nice.
So what?
All right.
He does, how'd you know that?
. Well this is all very flattering...
You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.
Uh, that's it.
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
No, I don't.
Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!
Oh, all right, James. He he he
Mr. Peterman?
Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
What?
Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
The balance beam?
Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
(shocked) Blaine!?
I said I'll take care of it!
There's Rachel.
He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
I know.
And he happens to be pretty good lookin.
(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
There's no Big Salad.
Right.
(delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman.
Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
Where did you find it?
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.
Oh, OK, see you later.
Oh. Big room?
You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
You still couldn't kiss her?
(giggling) Ohhh!!.
Oh, you have to lie.
Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
where's Tony?
We're not going to sit together?
What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
Absolutely.
Why?
Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
Uh, does it matter if it's melted?
Yeah.
Oh, lovely.
No. I don't want him looking.
I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
You know we were here, ahead of you.
George, please.
Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
You mean in a real Fight Fight?
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.
Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
Its disgusting.
Is she?
I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
(Just making conversation) Oh yeah?
I don't think so.
(enters) Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.
Oh. My ballet tickets.
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
Really?
Uh, man!
I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
What d'you mean?
Huh. (muttering) This should be interesting.
Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
Well, maybe.
No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...
Jerry, you can barbecue back here.
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
Yea why not?
I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
What was that?
Yeah, I don't know what that means.
Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
[mind] Who does this guy think he is?
Pocketbook or a handbag?
Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
Oh, I dont know..
Kramer.
Yeah, you know, head to toe.
Wait up!
Right.
I'm not below.
Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.
(Chuckles)
Hmm... No you don't.
Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
What?
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
How can I do that?
No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
Ugh! You are kidding me.
w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
It's Elaine.
Oh. Well, Usha.
(Into the intercom) Yeah?
(flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice.
How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
Yea, I guess that could work.
Well, that's...that's sweet.
Of Vincent's picks?
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
Come in, come in!
Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
Jon Voight? The actor?
You sure you don't need any help?
I bet your parents were upset, huh?
I think he does too
Really?
No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...
Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
HUH, so should you.
Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
I've got Super Bowl fever.
I don't know - it just is.
I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
Don't worry, I...
I think I'll let you do it.
Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
Is that the supermodel?
See, what did I tell ya?
"AAaaaaahhh! Really?"(giggles)
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
(In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
Yeah...
What is that?
I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
How is that?
How do you even know the jacket is there?
I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) Mm-hm.
But I really did like it
Unh, something with his spleen. Anyway it'll just take five minutes, O.K., and then, the hospital is right on the way.
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
What?!
You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
What does that mean?
Ohh! Stop it! I know.
No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
You never know...
( knocks) Hello is anybody here?..
It's a page number.
Uhm, I just have a question.
I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.
Oh, Kramer.
(Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!
Yeah, but that doesnt make up for killin her.
Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
You're very special.
Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
Hello.
(squeaky) Sure, sure.
Shove it!
Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
Oh...
Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
Hello.
Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table? They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make you sick.
Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
What?
(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
Whats going on? What is that look?
Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
Find out if likes you?. What, are you in High School?...George come on can't you just talk to her yourself?
You're gonna pick up the pieces.
We just got along *so* great.
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
I tought you didn't like double dates.
"Able Mentally Challenged Adults"
But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
(to George) Ya see?
(Sarcastic) Oh.
So we're having dinner tonight?
No, but... it is very nice to know.
Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
Yeah. Hah.
Who? Who is Ramon?
Jesus?
Hey.
Are the clubs there?
Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
I can't do that.
Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
they-they took it from Tolstoy.
(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
I knew those condoms were defective!
Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
Maybe we could all have dinner later?
I'm white.
You're still here. You're a dynamo.
What're you getting?
I dunno, at least three weeks.
No.
Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?
(touched, she takes it) Aw, Glenn.
No, I'm watching my weight.
Really?
(laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...
Jerry. It's *B*.*O*.
Its time you got outta here anyway.
I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.
Nedda?
Yeah.
Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
Get offa me!
Yeah.
Yeah. It is.
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
What are you doing with your old couch?
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
Hello.
Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
Its that bad?
I wouldn't have said anything if I knew you were going to stop seeing her!
Why is she doing this?
eh, Remember Roy, the artist?
Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
Hi.
Yeah, they don't know.
I know.
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on* and *on* and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak English.
I'm sorry... sorry.
Hey Kramer, by the way, I saw that guy at the health club...that is not Salman Rushdie.
Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
Yeah yeah, ok.
Sooo, how was your date?
Roy!
I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
Yeah.
You know... (looking up) the spirit world.
Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
 Jerry! Over here...
No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
"Oh yeah! Jimmy."
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
Hi
You want to bet?
Okay, (to Jerry) Move along. . .
It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
Green Lantern.
Yeah.
Ahh.
I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
Hi Julie.
Good for you.
I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
Mmm... phenomenal peas.
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
Yes it is level jumping.
He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
Very nice meeting you!
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
(Enters) Hey, what happened to you?
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
What?
But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
Well, one of you better damn well take it!
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
I don't understand.
Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
Why?
Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
I lied
You have no choice.
(Obviously not impressed, dull) Yeah, real nice.
Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.
Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.
Mrs. Winston?
Kramer, it's...
Yeah?
Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
How many?
Yeah.
I thought you were busy tonight.
Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
Hey.
It's his birthday and it's his last day?
Uuh.
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe youre doing this. This is absolutely infantile.
(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?
Where did you go?
He is?
Now what was that?
I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
So he was bad. What d'you care?
No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
(whispering to George) You're up.
No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?
Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
Uh ha.
(Sarcastically) Oh, that is really mature.
All right, see you later.
No, wait!
What happened?
So what'd you do last night?
The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
Good working with you.
Hey.
Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
Why?
What?
Oh.
What's this one?
But I, I can't go alone!
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Yeah.
That's great George.
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
Theres no Rubber Man.
So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
Hi!
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
I'll say.
All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
Ahh, yeah, sure.
According to Puddy.
Let me test-taste that. (tastes Jerry's yogurt)
No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...
And vodka.
Well maybe I feel the same way.
Nowhere.
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
Yeah, yeah, hello.
Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
(sighs Wa-ah) I don't know...a year?
(laughs) What?s all this?
Yeah. See that--
What? Wheren't they just here?
What?!
Hi!
Are you serious?
I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
You mean...?
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
This. My office. Sam trashed my office.
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
Alright. Goodnight.
So, that's the situation.
With the Chinese woman?!
Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
(sniffing) Dandruff?
What guy?
I know, it's not that.
Sara Sitarides?
Start smoking.
There he is.
Huh?
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
Why would he come to George?
You went...in the shower?
Faking what?
Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
Yeah, how about her?
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
Karen?
Yeah, obviously.
No, that'd be too noisy.
What?!
Hey, where's Kramer?
Huh?
Thanks for the re-fill.
She did? Oh, that's so great!
I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
Hi.
Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
Take it easy. Bye-Bye Alison!
(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
Pardon me?
And I want my keys back from you!
Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some money.
It's a long story.
It's dancing.
(from a distance) Hey.
Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.
Isnt that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you shouldve done? You shouldve turned it inside out.
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
Uhh.
(disappointment) Aww. Sold out.
It's supposed to feel good.
What? What?...
I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
Yeah.
What soup place?
Uh, (sob) thanks.
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
He is a Maestro.
Ah,
Jerry? Jerry!
What kind of soup did he get?
So, the only reason ...
Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.
Uh Roy, this is uh Kramer -- he's one of our friends.
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
Hmm.
Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
I thought you were hungry.
What is it?
Hi.
(looking in the box) Well what is this?
Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
Do adults ever order the child-size?
Well, you're not Superman.
I am not buying a computer from you.
You really oughtta do something about that cold.
Yeah!
Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
(Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
Yeah, alright, I gotta go.
I don't know.
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
You can still go.
Ow, ow move over.
I don't buy it.
This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
Yeah, it's a bra.
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
Hi George. Hi Jimmy.
You know, we should say something.
(to the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something. You are not gonna get away with this!
Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?
( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
Uh-huh.
(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
Yup. You?
So what'd you do?
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
Oh, wonderful!
Makes you wonder, though, doesnt it?
How did you...
Why should you get the first class?
The Soup Nazi!
(laughs) Yeah, right, youre the master packer.
You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
You didn't know.
I never should have given Anna the impression--
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
Uh, this is,
Did he crumble any crackers in it?
Really?
Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you dont want to go to... that... no.
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
Youre pregnant.
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
And they're gonna look great in your apartment, George.
Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
Why don't you go ahead and call him?
Hey. What's this.?.
...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'
I thought you hated Los Angeles.
Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
It's not a purse. It's European.
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
Difficult?
What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
Maybe.
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
Hm-hmm.
Im just curious.
Since when?
A wedding.
Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
Hi Tina.
You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
I, uh, wait,
Where's my drink?
Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
Oh, my god.
I thought he was Kramer's friend.
Oh, I love cashmere.
Ah--this is part of the problem!
Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?
What're you stopping here for?
(slower and louder) I'm kind of swamped.
Jerry!
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
I am?
Who are you, my uncle?
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
Hi.
These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
(awed) Oh, look at this!
Maybe.. All over your face!
What? What happened?
Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
Yeah.
Really? You really missed me?
Would you please?
Uh, kind of.
You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
(uncomfortable) Ooh.
You have a water bed?
Burma.
Huh. (pause) Oh my god.
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
Really?
Are we still going to the movies tonight?
Who told you this
What
(encouraging) Dont forget.
Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.)
What?!
You've been an enormous help.
(Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite.
Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
Yeah.
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Uhh... no.
(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
what?
I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
Let's make it fifty.
Hello.
Hello
KRAMER, are we doing a bad thing?
Well we could ...
News? What news?
It's B.O. The *valet* must have had B.O.
I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.
He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up
He's not ga-ga.
(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.
He seems to be breathing.
(sighing) Again?
All right, look, look, look. Lets say he stole it.
Sauce me.
Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
You left your door open.
So?
Oh, gimme a break!
See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..
Where would I take the test?
Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!
Tomorrow evening, sure.
Oh, wasn't that terrible?
Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
Oh, I know the type.
This is all very exciting.
Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)
Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, Mr. Peterman.
Uh-huh.
He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
They want five thousand dollars now.
I don't want it.
Alright.
I gave him an ultimatum.
I won't.
Yeah...
Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
I didn't get it.
Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
What do you mean?
When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
Hmm. Sickies.
You can get a hot dog in the theater.
(to George) Are you happy now?
Do you need anything?
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
[in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
Unless youre married to a dictator.
What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
Well at least let George do it!
Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
That's a pretty girl.
Ah nuts!
(embroidering) Some corn.
50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?
Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
No.
Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
You went to see her?
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
Really?
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
I can't, I don't have it, I don't have a square to spare, I can't spare a square
I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.
She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
What? What sweater?
(on the buzzer) Buzz me.
Fine.
(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
No.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked. Naked. Naked.
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
Hey.
Oh, no, it's okay.
Ah, Susan uses the sponge.
(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
Oops! (bumps into Levitan) 'Scuse me.
Are you
You're not still thinking about that are you?
Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
Oh, right.
Hey, how we doin' on time?
Well..hum...let me rephrase that, She said....
How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
Yeah.
You think I should have asked George?
I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
What?
Just the fact that you remembered means everything.
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
No, don't...
Well so what. I mean you played first base. I mean they always put the worst player on first base. That's were they put me and I stunk.
So it wasn't a bomb.
(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
Oh good.
Hi, Susan.
What's the order?
(thrilled) She died?!
(weary) Okay.
Get out of my way, Jerry.
What?
What are you doing? What is all this?
He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
Yeah.
(Sincere) I'm sorry.
And... hes hilarious.
(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
No, not at all...
(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
Two, three hundred?
Softer.
(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
Well, thanks for a nice evening. It was really fun.
Hey!
What are you writing? Doctor.
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
Great. You?
Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
(big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.
Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
And I am not coming back!
No thanks.
Really?
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
Isn't that blue car him?
Pardon?
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
Dump her.
The cat.
You didn't know.
Oh, yeah.
Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
Yeah, tell im George.
Huh! Sexy?
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
Hmm. (she nods in agreement)
Really?
Mm, love Farbman.
I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
(Correcting herself) Maestro!
All right. He kissed me. Okay?
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
No.
This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
Thank-you.
Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
Oh, hello.
Huh!
... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
(wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!
What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
"your shirt was out?"
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
I am up for anything.
Hmm! Rico!
Oh, that's nice!
Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
See you later.
Yep.
Yeah, but it's only three blocks.
Yeah, I could use a chuckle.
I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.
Kicked out?! Why?!
You asked me to.
(picking up) Jerry!
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
I got a note from my gynecologist.
No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
Hi, Judy.
What?
Hi!
Yeah, it's funny, I dunno.
What are you saying?
Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
No! You couldnt wait to get back to your little... conversation.
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
Yeah!
Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
So that's it?
It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
No, no.
Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
Uh oh.
Oh it's you.
Todd.
It was a joke...
Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
Hey hey
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
Why don't you just shut the f-
Kramer has a record.
What about the look?
Huh?
I do.
Me too.
Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
I dont mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.
I can't believe you left your post.
Pick. Up.
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
Five minutes? That's it?
Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
What? Why not?
And you stopped by just to give it to me?
(pleased) Ah.
Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
A wedding? Have you lost it, man?
He can't go left.
Oh, she got hurt.
I might be Elaine.
It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
(indicating) That's her. That's her.
George, I just don't want you interfering.
Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!
So if you can drive, you're not handicapped?
Yeah.
Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
Really. Why?
Definitely. Are you?
You can say that again.
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
How's it going'?
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
(sarcastically, to George) Stay!
Jerry, my leg.
Hey!
Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
Oh, Come on.
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
You told him!!!!
(Between laughs) What is that?!
Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt.
You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.
What?
(gasp) An accident? What happened?
Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
I can't take your bedroom.
(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
Jerry, I'm on the other line.
No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
Yeah, that's too bad.
This cantaloupe stinks.
Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
Really? When?
(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
I smell cherry.
Well I have to interview a Mohel.
Oh, yeah.
I can find out.
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
What?
Okay.. The point , George, is she likes you.
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
Hey George.
I can't believe we broke up like that.
Interesting.
What?
So what did he say?
Why?
Hey, I didn't even use one.
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
Oh It must be my new organizer.
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
Where are they goin'?
I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
What? JERRY Where's the car?
Excuse me.
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
Oh, it was a frame-up.
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
Just some?
Well, I don't.
Are you going down?
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
Its Elaine.
Because I was gooood.
(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
All shell think is that you like her.
Thank god I found you..
He wrote a song about it!
Yeah, but you like the face painting.
(backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww...
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
(neutral) Fine.
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
"War and Peace."
Saturday.
Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...
AH! I've got it.
Excuse me?
So? What do you want me to do about it?
Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
Yeah, who speaks Korean?
Well, how could he do that?
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
Please, please. It's really, really itchy.
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
We know what a face consists of.
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?
Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
(enters) Hey.
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
I'll put in a good word for you.
Why?
You want it?
Yeah.
Well, relationships are very important to me.
George!
Hey.
(pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
Hi....???
(right away) No. Second choice.
I am?
I'd stick.
You never get good haircuts.
Oh! (comes to him)
Hey.
Maybe shes there in spirit. How about that?
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
Uh-huh...
Why do you have a bug guy?
Really cold.
About five.
Uh...sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.
What the hell does that mean?
Uh, don't worry, he's cool.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!
Yes, he is lazy.
What?
Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
Oh my God.
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
Kneel?
Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
What is this?
Wow. You really have a terrible voice.
I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.
Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
Yeah.
(dread) No, no, no, no, no.
Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.
What did he have to say?
Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
You know, it's not really that terrible.
Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
(nods) HumHummmm....
What could happen?
I got him a two-line phone.
Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
You sure you dont mind?
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
Ye.
How about Youve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. Youre not even you. Youre Dan.
. . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
Okay.
Uh, uh.
Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
No, that's not it!
No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.
Albano is your last name.
Paul?
It's invisible.
Hey! Guess who's not married.
Kramer, they're painted on!
Wel-Well, I just dont appreciate these little courtesy responses, like Im selling you aluminum siding.
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
(to George) I'm gettin' his mail.
He actually went to the hospital?
Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
What?
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
In fact she said that looks aren't even that important to her...
What? What?
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
(Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?
Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
Yeah, the address is 78th West...
(emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs)
(rolling her eyes) Lithe!
I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
Eight-fifty.
Great!
Uh, excuse me.
Alrighty, bye.
I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
Oh, sure.
I can't believe you ski!
(Confused) What is wrong with this book?
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
JERRY Hey
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
Well, that was fast!
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
What? Well, who's gonna do it?
[stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
Well, actually it's pretty grimy.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
I dance fine.
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?
All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
New jeans?
Thanks
All right, pile it on.
What do you think?
What is it ..A drawing of Mr. Magoo
Yes, he is dumb.
Me too
'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?
They're going to promote me to editor.
(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
(Yelling to Jerry in the bedroom) Hey Jerry, come on, let's go. We're gonna miss the previews!
Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...
(Overly generous) Hi, David!
Yeah! You're probably right.
Where did you get all these pictures?
Really?
Well what about you. Where you gonna stay?
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
Gone.
No, no! They'll stay up!
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
A little.
Hey, I didn't get one either.
(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
Or you.
OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
Oh.
What about a bad gasket?
No, no no.
We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
(quietly) What?
Yeah.
Rarely.
So? What'd they say?
Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, theyd put it out in the front.
I couldnt believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.
It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
Okay, okay. Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
Yeah that's just some stuff about the company.
What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
*No*, we would have heard it.
(Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
And the bush-women.
Can we rest here a second.
You can.
Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.
You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
Wall street.
Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.
yeah.. I I just forgot to check so if you could just spare me some.
Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.
David and I will not be getting back together.
Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
Jerrys the one who got me my new apartment.
Well, come on we're on vacation.
(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?
Today?!
(excited) This is so fantastic. I dont know how to thank you.
You can't ask a person to change their name.
No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
Oh.
Youre getting what?
I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
What pool guy?
What?
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
Well, all I know is, he doesn't like games and he doesn't play games, you know? He has too much character and integrity.
I'm not being superficial
You know, uh...they're fake.
Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
Do I know him?
Huh.
I dont know. I cant think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?
(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
George I was just kidding around.
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
Yes, Mr. Pitt?
It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
I didn't pay attention.
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
Oh, we forgot to pick a number.
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
Oh! I forgot to tell you--
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.
What did you do?
Some night, huh?
Aha.
Good. Good. You?
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
What did she say?
All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
You oughta at least take a look at it.
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
What is a bender anyhow?
What?
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
That's a pretty big tip...
Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?
Oh! The Risotto broad.
And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
So, what are you saying?
Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
No idea.
Oh, the guy with cancer?
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
Well done. (pats George on the shoulder)
Yeah, you *could*...
That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.
Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.
Was it my fault?
Yeah.
Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
Because! Because she missed her period!
Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning)
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
Listen to me you little shi........
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
O.K. You start. What's your first choice?
I don't know about that.
Hey.
But I got my own note.
That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
Uh, Mr. Costanza, I
(raising her hand) Scuse me, master packer...
What's the name of this physical therapist?
(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
I am not qualified to run the catalog!
Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
What the hell is this? Where are you?
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
Yes, yes Mr. Mandel.
So how did this happen?
Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
You know, I'm going as a beard.
Well, then, if hes crazy you should just forget it.
(positive) Oh! (little chuckle)
Oh, take 'em.
You sure? Anything?
I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
Mmm, this is delicious.
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
What's happening?
No, I got caught.
Hi Cosmo
What?
No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
Hi!
Ya, Yes we will!
Oh, yeah...
.....Hi.
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
Yes it is.
(as though receiving a revelation) Poppies!
Ill see ya. (Hanging up the phone)
Un-huh.
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
[exasperated] What is it made of?
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
Jerry, I've always loved ..u..
I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do in the movies.
I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
Did you get a haircut?
There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
What is your answer to number 74?
What, are you into this?
What? Why not?
No, no, but I would like to hear it.
Ugghh.
You see? Again.
All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
Why? Because I can?
(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
Well it was easy. Really.
What? What is this?
Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
Thank you. (gets up from her seat)
I don't believe this.
(smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon.
Shall I undo it?
George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
You know you're chippin' in.
Jerry?!
I think it's great. I think you should get it.
No, still Sharon!
Just gimme twenty bucks.
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
Oh, see you tomorrow morning.
You think it's effeminate?
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
Oh. Are you alright?
[gasps]
No.
So humm....When you gonna call her?
I don't believe this woman.
Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
Uh huh.
Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
Yeah. That's him.
What's wrong with him?
Well, did he say that?
So, I haven't seen you in a while.
Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?
(Confused) What combination?
(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
Hey. Is that your horse outside?
Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
(quietly) I,...
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
This is what people do.
I dunno.
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this.
Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
What, you never said it?
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
So.
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
I wish.
Hey!
Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?
Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
What air conditioner?
Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?
You know, we had a really bad break-up.
Where are you going?
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
So they don't want a baby?
Well, that is, that is strange.
No, I really don't.
(quietly) OK.
Hello.
Milhouse.
Would you change yours?
(Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
Oh my God! It's all over the test!
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
No, no.
Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
What kind of maniac is this guy?
Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in the morning.
You're right Maestro.
Okay, c'mon it's movie time.
He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
Mr. Pitt...
Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!
Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...
(dismissive) Gene's trash.
All right and that just about... does it.
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
Oh that's origi-
Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
Well, Here we are.
What happened? It looks the same.
Kramer, you look terrible.
You want to go to India?
He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
You did didn't you.
Your crazy!
What's wrong?
What? No good?
Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.
Sure, fine.
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
New couch? Why?
All time.
Well, I'll see ya... (exits)
Yeah.
Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
Ahahaha. Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you get to lose weight.
(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
No. Me neither.
Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
Whew that was a dozy.
(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
I've got no room.
(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
What?
(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!
Well, are you going to take a nap or --
Get in there!
There are plenty of things to say.
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
I can't. I'm the best man.
Excuse me?
You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
Hi Sue Ellen.
Ha! That's preposterous.
Who's that?
Heyyyyyy (leaning in, very friendly and happy)
Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
Jerry!
You smoke?
What? What have I become? I haven't "become" anything...
Mr. Peterman.
Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
What?
Potato.
Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
Eh.
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
Ya!
Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
She said you're getting together Saturday night!
Nah, we just play defense.
Hey, what happened to you?
What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
Really?
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
Oh. Ok. Thank you.
George?
Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person but this is too much to ask.
Okay.
All right.
Rules.
Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.
Yeah. Who sent you that one?
Wha...?
Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
Excuse me?
What?
That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.
and here.
Arrive?
Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)
So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
Excuse me.
Hi.
This guy I'm seeing.
It smells like a rubber fire.
Hello. (she enters)
He's waving..
Jer, do you see where this is going?
You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
I got stuff to do.
(Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
Want to go get something to eat?
Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
Some dinner, huh?
Must wean.
"All right, I'm gone"
Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
Black Forrest?
Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
(To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
Oh it was such a great night.
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
Yes! Couldn't you see that?
No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
I know. I need a lesson.
Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.
I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
(whispering to Jerry) Yes!
Oh, that's fantastic.
(on buzzer) It's me.
Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
What? What?
It's me.
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
Yeah?
Too tight?
Like you're a liar!
I can't believe she's walking around in that.
Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
Oh. Have you been out?
I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
You never know.
Interracial? Us?
I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
Hey, Jean-Paul.
Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get dressed! Get dressed!
What'd you have?
Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
Forget it!
(unsure) Oh-kay.
Oh, of course.
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
No no, I can't sit in the front row.
I'm not telling you.
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
So?
(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
You can tip a gardener.
So listen, what are you gonna get him?
What?
"I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
Shut up, George.
He told you about our conversation?
Oh, they won't?
Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
What did he say?
Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
Oh, yeah?
(Quick) What situation? I have a situation?
Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
Six hundred and twenty million people died.
Hey, hey, hey!
Oh Thanks, thank you very much.
Well podiatrist.
Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer!
(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?
Hello?
No, no, no. You give me your number.
I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
I'll take it.
Well, can I introduce you as doctor?
(annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing)
We, there are always a few.
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
Hi.
(looking guiltier) No, nono.
It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
That's so, that's so sweet.
Yeah? What else?
Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters.
Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
Thanks a lot.
I do to.
These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
You don't have any furniture?
We have to replace the couch.
What is that?
Mm. This food is fantastic.
Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
Why is that beautiful?
(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.
(Giving up too easy) Okay.
I can't kick you out of your bed.
Yeah, the jewel thief.
Yeah, I think I might.
Huh huh.
Kramer
I've got a confession to make.
Why?
But it's cold out.
But she was fifteen.
(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
What about his comedy act?
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
What are you doing?
Book it.
(sighs)
Couldnt be happier.
[annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.
No, he wants to torture me.
Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
Oh..Nice to meet you.
You're not serious.
Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.
(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
Hey George
Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
a square?
Oh no, thank you.
Where are we going?
Do you have to?
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
No, there are degrees of coincidences.
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
Waddya' write?
Uh... sure/yeah..
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
What? Why is it me who always has to do these things?
(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
Did you tell him it was peed on?
Mr. Peterman?
Oh.
No, No....Yesss!!!!!!
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
It... works!
Yeah I am still holding.
(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
I know, it's just something you have to say...
You can go.
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
Kramer, what is wrong with you?
yeah.
If only.
Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)
W..well, can't I come in?
I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
What, are you in a bad mood?
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
Do you smell something?
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
Uh, that's, ...
(softly to Dick) Dick.
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
Good-bye
Yes it is.
Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
How bout a Big Salad?
Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
'Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
Got it.
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
Yeah, yeah he is. (as she leaves)
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
It must be a mistake.
Where did you get my chart?
(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.
(upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.
(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).
Stop _ the _ fight!
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.
No, sir, I can't.
You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.
(Nodding) The other guy.
Hello? Vincent?
So who's playing Elaine?
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
How high did I go?
So anyway, I stood up to shake her hand, then suddenly I lost my balance and I fell right into her.
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
Hi.
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
No way!
(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
Pliers?
Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
Did you read the whole thing?
Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
Yeah? What was it?
Jerry, do I stink?
I guess we could've called for help.
( Heavy Panting) It's not on any table, Kramer. Where is it?
Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
Uh... (clears her throat) Rifkin.
'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
He could have died
South Africa.
Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
Hi George.
I have no chance, do I?
Um, no.
Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because theyre clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he cant count to ten, so dont give me hygiene.
Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
yeah me too
Hi.
Ah, look who's here. "Silicon Valley."
Well, I don't know about "gold."
Have you ever thought about it?
Cleaning supplies?
(resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine.
He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
Its killing you isn?t it?
Who was that?
Was it blue?
You speak Burmese?
No not quite.
(unhappy) I...
Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment and, I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee and it's supposed to make them feel good.
How do you know?
So go buy a new one.
Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
See, yeah, that's all I was saying.
Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
Hey, working out?
I'm *really* hungry!
Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
She's Cynthia!
( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
We made plans.
(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
Good workout?
Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
Well do you see it or don't you?
Yeah, she was an editor.
Nuthin'. Then he took me home.
Yes.
Coccoon II The Return. I guess they didnt like it up there.
No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
No.
I need something to read on the subway.
Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
But, that didn't happen to you.
No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -
What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
I didn't say anything.
I, I don't think so.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer... Hold on a second. I don't get this. This woman has *never* been with a man her *entire* life--
Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We never dated in winter.
Thanks for the dinner.
I'm sorry you have to go.
...so much. You're so damn...sexy.
No. You got the wrong number, kid.
How could that be the dog?
Ohh...
It ever happened! Understand?
(quiet) Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.
Oh.
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
(neutral) Alright.
Where are you going?
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
Who's this guy?
(Smiling, chewing) Who, me?
(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
You have a little thing for this fella'?
(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
Oh god this tastes terrible.
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
Oh.
Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
What about the party? What about the Drake?
Really?
Like... (doing it) Like this?
Oh, come on.
So you consider this a relationship?
Hello boys.
Between a peck and a make out.
Wha- a picture?
Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)
How did you get that job?
Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
Where's Jerry?
I can't believe he hasn't called.
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
are you kidding, he's a mimbo I know that.. but he's my mimbo, you know and even if he is a hideous freak maybe, maybe I can learn to love him, maybe in some final irony (Jerry is looking the other way), I'll learn what love really is. You know Jerry
Whatever you want.
Really.
Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
So we can go anywhere we want?
I never saw the statue.
Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.
No, I just..
Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
(ingratiatingly) They should be here today.
Wait, what about your vomit streak?
Yeah, so?
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
Enchante.
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
I think they look good!
Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
I needed them to help me break my fall! If it hadn't been for them, I could have really injured myself!
Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...
(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
No. Your. (breathes)
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
You ready?
Hello.
All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
Yep. Yeah..
What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
So what do you want me to do?
*And* he gets the rest of my chicken...
Nothing. He walked me home.
Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
*How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
Oh quite.
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
Ed.
Yeah, exactly, the "triangle" guy.
I thought that was pretty good, huh?
I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
Yeah, he did.
(LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.
(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
Yeah, you know (scratches cheek and sniffs)
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
Ah, this really sticks in my craw.
I think they might be real.
Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
(confused) Jimmy legs?
....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
Do you?
"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
Noo!
Ah, no.
It's not an easy thing to bring up.
You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
So you cant do both?
No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
Yeah, perhaps.
Come on tell me what happened.
Burma?
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
[heavy sarcasm] Oh. Thanks.
unbridled enthusiasm...?
How can I go?
You didn't hear me buzzing?
Very near.
Look at you. You're on a slant.
Yes (clears her throat) yes I did.
Alright thats it! Were back together!
If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
did something happened?
No thanks.
Mm-hmm.
It looks exactly like me.
I told him I was busy.
No, I don't want the man either.
What is with him?
I can't believe what's going on out here.
I say, it's a peach.
Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
Where's Beth?
Hey!
I hate this.
Hi!
Yeah, no problem.
Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
So? Where were you?!
What? You never told me that.
Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
I don't like this, it is to easy.
Hi.
Yeah.
Hey, did you make the movie?
It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
She's gonna ask how you got her number.
"How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
Who is that?
Mind? Oh o-of course not.
Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
Okay... bathroom....kitchen.
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?
Our big screen TV is probably arriving right now...
Yknow what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamelas birthday.
Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
Aren't you too young to be bitter?
What?
Thank you...aah, hm mm.
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
I just don't get it.
Elaine Benes?
Soup's not all that good anyway.
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
Just go.
How do you know all that?
(downcast) Yeah.
No!
(horrified) Get together!!
What? What is that?
Ohhhhh, that's great.
