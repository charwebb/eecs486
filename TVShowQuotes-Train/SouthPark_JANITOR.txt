Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit.
I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
Hey! Pssst!  Come over here.  You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?
We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches.
I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy. 
Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?
Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches. 
I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style.  It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.
