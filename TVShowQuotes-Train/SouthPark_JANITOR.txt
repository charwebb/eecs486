Hey! Pssst!  Come over here.  You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?
Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit.
Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style.  It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.
I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches. 
Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here.  This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet.  And you might wanna pack a barf bag.
Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches.
Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy. 
Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?
