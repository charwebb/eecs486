What is your name? (he turns the page over the money)
Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up.
Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a table.
No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 2!
Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.
Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh.
Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready.
Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?
Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like that. Nobody came up, I hang up.
Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.
