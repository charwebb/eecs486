And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich. 

Ge-get outta here, PeTA! We're changin' the mascot already!

Cuh-can you imagine what we thought when you said, "Aides for Everyone Foundation?"

Mr. Slave, little Wendy from class wants to see you.

Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.

Then it's time... We can undo the banner! 

Oh, hello Wendy. Are you all right?

All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak.

Well sure, come on in. Mr. Slave is right over here. 

Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall-Mart!

There he is, beatin' that dead horse!

Oh, looks like somebody else is doin' a little partyin' tonight.

All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we are going to change our school mascot.

Oh yeah, sure, you're just buyin' that for your bad coughs, right?  Us too. 

Hey everybody, it's time!  It's time!

Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche.

His name is Garrison, Mr. Garrison. He lost ten pounds takin' Jared's lead-

Give him time, Wendy. Give him time.  Come on, Mr. Slave.

No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people.

...Oh dear. Mr. Slave, I think you and Wendy better have a little talk. I'll make some cocoa.

Oh, ge-get outta here!  Ge-get out!  Jesus, where do they keep coming from?!  Go on, get outta here.

Now, that's a whore! 

Hey everybody!  They just found all the PETA members murdered at their compound!

Alright, now the French Revolution was basically started by a young man named Marius. , who only knew Jean Valjean as an older man, and uh-  ...uh, the French government at the time was led by Javert, who was trying to-

It's like we're a real town now. 

Let's burn it down!

Okay, now let's get back to it, kids. What kind of verb is this?  "The sad girl puts balls in her mouth." Or, in Futurespeak of course, "Gluch gligh balls glych gligh."

Yeah, lets all shop over at True Value!

Well what are you doing here, Randy?

Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians...
