Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. 
These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!
My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.
So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?
Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! 
Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.
Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?
No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! 
Now, where did you leave him, young man?
This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?
Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! 
Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.
Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.
Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. 
We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it 
Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.
It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important.
That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?
That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.
Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?
Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.
Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party.
Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty!  Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! 
You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.
Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!
Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.
Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.
This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! 
Now when you learn to make the dreidel spin
You'll know our people always win.
Keep spinning:
Learn
Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
How dare you include the Nativity in a school play?  Don't you realize my son is Jewish?! 
And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. 
I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.
Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.
A new family moved in? Where are they from?
Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?
Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really? 
Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. 
It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again.Â 
That isn't all, Mayor!  The school play is doing a Nativity scene!  It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!
Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.
Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
Hey, you will not get away with this!  That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.
Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.
Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?
I've got a great game for you. It's called "ookie mouth".
Oh, how precious! You boys are all playing dreidel. Now, you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the Hebrew people.
But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education.  From the school.
Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.
You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!
But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.
The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!
Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them?
It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.
No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.
Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!
We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.
You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 
Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.
I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.
Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.
Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...
Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."
Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.
So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.
We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.
Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name. 
Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.
Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!
So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?
No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 
I'll put it in the microwave right away. 
Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.
Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.
Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now. 
Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?
I want to talk to you all about your school nurse. 
Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.
How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.
Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."
The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?  Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!  We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes. 
Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?
No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.
Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you  Kyle, and you can be Kyle...  Two! 
Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.
Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.
Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!
We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come! 
Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 
He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it. 
Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 
Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. 
We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.
We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!
Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.
Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.
If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!  Ike, love?
Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.
...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.
I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.
I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.
They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts!
WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. 
But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.  Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it! 
Oh, of course!  Here you go.  Leaving so soon?
Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father.  Ike, you will eat this!
Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.
Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.
Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.
At last, now we can return to normality.
Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!
Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!  Waagghh!!  My baby!!
Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.
So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?
We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!  We want more quality television, like Full House. 
There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!
New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! 
He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.
So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.
That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.
Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!
Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!
We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!
Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out in the street!
Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?
Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.
Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. 
No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.  That ought to take care of it.
...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.
Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.
Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!
Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. 
No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. 
He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.
Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?
No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.
Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.
Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?
Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.
My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.
Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.
Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!
People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life.
I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. 
Let go of her, you piece of trash! 
It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
I thought it would be good for you.
That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
It's okay,  I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.
First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.
Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.
There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?
I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. 
Whatwhatwhaaat!!!  Come on everybody, back to New York! 
Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!
Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.
All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.
No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! 
He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted. 
It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.
Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!
Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault
Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?
It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.
Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.
Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. 
Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?
You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. 
Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.
When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.
Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?
Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. 
He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. 
Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!
Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.
Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!
Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.
That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! 
It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.
Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright?
I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.
Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!
And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.
HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!  This is your mother! You will open this door right now!
Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! 
That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?  Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!
And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."
We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.
Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.
