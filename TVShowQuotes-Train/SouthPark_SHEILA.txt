Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.
Here we go, Kyle Two.  And here's yours, Kyle. 
You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.
Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault
There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important.
Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.
What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."
First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.
You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.
So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.
This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! 
Now when you learn to make the dreidel spin
You'll know our people always win.
Keep spinning:
Learn
Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!
Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.
Let go of her, you piece of trash! 
Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.
But you're more in touch with the earth.
Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts!
What the hell is this???  This is horrible!!!
Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.
And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?
Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?
It's okay,  I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.
Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now! 
Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really? 
Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now. 
HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!  This is your mother! You will open this door right now!
Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.
To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."
I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.
Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! 
Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.
Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name. 
Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.
Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.
How dare you include the Nativity in a school play?  Don't you realize my son is Jewish?! 
The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.
He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
A new family moved in? Where are they from?
Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! 
Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.
So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
Now, where did you leave him, young man?
I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.
We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.
That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.
Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.
We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.
Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it 
But who can we get to build it?
Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.
Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!
Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.
No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 
Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them?
Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.
When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.
Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.
I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.
Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?
Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.
That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?
Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.
My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.
Their grandmother's been dead for three years.  You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your-  mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!
Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it. 
No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.
Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.
Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father.  Ike, you will eat this!
Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?
Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.
Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?
Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!
That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.
That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. 
Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! 
He left a note saying he's never coming back.
I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.
Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.
Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.
Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.  You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins. 
Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?
Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.
Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?
All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.
Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.
Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! 
It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.
I'll put it in the microwave right away. 
Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright?
That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 
Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!
Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.
No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!
We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!
No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.
Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. 
Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 
Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called "conjoined twin myslexia".
Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!
Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.
Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.
To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life.
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!
We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!  We want more quality television, like Full House. 
Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. 
It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. 
Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?
Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you  Kyle, and you can be Kyle...  Two! 
So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?
Oh, how precious! You boys are all playing dreidel. Now, you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the Hebrew people.
You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.
We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.
At last, now we can return to normality.
Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.
Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.
Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!
People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.
We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.
I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
Oh, of course!  Here you go.  Leaving so soon?
Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?  Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!
Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty!  Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! 
...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.
Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. 
Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.
He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.
Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. 
I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.
Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.
Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?
I thought it would be good for you.
Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. 
My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.
That isn't all, Mayor!  The school play is doing a Nativity scene!  It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!
Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.
No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. 
No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! 
So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?
I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.
How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!
He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.
How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?
Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!
Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?
Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--
No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.  That ought to take care of it.
Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.
Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. 
Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
I've got a great game for you. It's called "ookie mouth".
WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. 
Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.
He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! 
Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?
This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!
I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. 
I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...
Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. 
That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?
That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! 
Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. 
But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.  Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it! 
They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!
Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.
Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. 
It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.
Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!
Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!
...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.
It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.
Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.
Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.
We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party.
We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come! 
Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.  Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.
Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out in the street!
That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.
Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.
It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.
Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!
He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. 
Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?
I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!
Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
Whatwhatwhaaat!!!  Come on everybody, back to New York! 
Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!
But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.
No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education.  From the school.
Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.
Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!  Waagghh!!  My baby!!
No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 
And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."
