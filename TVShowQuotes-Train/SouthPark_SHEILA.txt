Kyle!  You're back!

Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?

We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come! 

It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important.

It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.

Oh yes!

This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?

Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?

Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny.

Come on!

He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. 

No! Hello, how are you?

Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!  Waagghh!!  My baby!!

Catch anything?

Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too.

I'm doing the best I can!

Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?

Gerald! Gerald, get down here!

It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again.Â 

There's daddy!

No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! 

I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.

How?

Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.

Oh, Kyle! You're safe!

We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.

Mr. Garrison, are you all right?

our people always win.

Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. 

Us Jews don't believe in hell.

But first, apologize to your brother!

I'm sure your friends will love him.

Now when you learn to make the dreidel spin
You'll know our people always win.
Keep spinning:

The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?  Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!  We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes. 

You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!

We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!

Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.

Boys, that's ridiculous.

Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.

Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!

Hi bubbe.

Oh, dear, but I'm barely dressed.

Kyle!

Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.

We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.

It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it. 

No, Kyle.

Gerald, do something!

WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?

Look, Gerald. Kyle's on television! 

Kyle! What happened to you?!

Gerald, what has gotten into him?

Why? What did you do, Kyle?!

We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.

Oh my God, what is that?! 

Oh really? Is that so?

Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!

You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.

our people always win.

Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!

It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.

Yes, it was fabulous!

Yes, Kyle Two?

This is for your own good, bubbe.

I think you'd better leave.

A dolphin?!?!

No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.

Kyle!

Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.

Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.

Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.

And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. 

Keep spinning: learn

The whole thing.

Gerald, this is crazy!

He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted. 

Kyle? Kyle?  Get the doctor!

Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."

Excuse me?

Okay, here he is.

Look out for yourselves!

Oh, hello Chris, Linda.

Oh, this is so exciting

Dug her up? Why??

No you can't!

Really?

Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!

Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.

Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!

HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!  This is your mother! You will open this door right now!

Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.

But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!

Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.

Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww. 

Gerald, this is ten dollars a hand!

Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.

Whatwhatwhaaat?!

O-o-o-o-oh!

Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.

That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.

Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts!

We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!  We want more quality television, like Full House. 

There you are, boys!

It's Jewish tradition, bubbe.

First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.

Oh Gerald, what are we gonna do?

Oh my God!

Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

HIV?

That isn't all, Mayor!  The school play is doing a Nativity scene!  It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!

Kyle, it's over!

I sure hope this works.

Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!

That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.

Here Carol, I think it's your boy.

Kyle! 

Gerald, what are you talking about?

Oh, well there's a relief.

No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 

No hot tub for me!

What is this?  It's horrible!

Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.

What's a Chinpokomon?

Are you crazy?!

No, that's impossible!

I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.

Try and act Jewish. 

Basically.

Gerald!  Keep your damn mouth shut!

Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!

There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?

No, it's true!

I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.

You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.

I guess we need to talk.

Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son!

...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.

I'm just kidding.

Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.

Oh, hello. 

Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.

Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?

Ike, you behave!

Kyle!  Sshhh!

He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! 

Oh, Kyle isn't home right now, hon.

The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!

Kyle, don't belittle your own people!

Gerald, what the hell is going on?

Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.

She's really touched.

Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?

That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!

They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?

Oh, that's so touching. 

My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.

So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?

Hello. Do I know you?

Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. 

I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. 

That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.

Well, best of luck to you, then.

Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!

I'll drive you boys. 

All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!

Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.

Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop!

Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.

Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.

Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party.

Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas. 

Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.

Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 

Yeah, the nerve of some people.

Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?

It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.

Wonderful!

Really? In People?

How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?

How was your flight? 

Wonderful!

...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.

It's lovely. Thank you.

How is my little jellybean?

What, bubbeleh, what is it?

Kyle!!

Oh, so did Gerald. 

No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.  That ought to take care of it.

I'll put it in the microwave right away. 

What??

Oy, what is the matter with them?

So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?

These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!

Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.

Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.

to make the dreidel spin 

Absolutely not, Kyle!

Now, where did you leave him, young man?

Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.

Their grandmother's been dead for three years.  You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your-  mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!

Oh God, this, this is horrible!

Well I don't wanna play here!

Kyle, eh, the problem is...

to make the dreidel spin

I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.

Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!

And how are you, Kyle?

No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. 

And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.

Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?

I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.

Oh, how precious! You boys are all playing dreidel. Now, you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the Hebrew people.

You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!

Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright?

Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.

Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.

Pretty much what I expected.

Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.

Huh?  Oh my God... 

Okay. I'll get our coats. 

Hurry! Hurry!

Alright, bubbe.  Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah.

Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?

Whatwhatwhaaat!!!  Come on everybody, back to New York! 

Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. 

Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.

Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.

They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!

They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.

Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?

Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. 

This is "The Miracle Worker"?

If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!  Ike, love?

That's great.

What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?

Right over here. 

Gerald?!

Oh my God.

He left a note saying he's never coming back.

Oh, of course!  Here you go.  Leaving so soon?

No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.

What?!

There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?

I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.

So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?

Isn't he getting any better, doctor?

Yes.Â 

Mmmrragh!!

Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.

Well then, you are grounded, mister!

What are you gonna do?

Did you sleep in the same room?

Okay, here! 

What did he say?

Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.

Well that sounds like a good deal.

People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?

Oh Gerald, it's beautiful.

Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.

Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. 

Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!

How are you feeling, boubbie?

Let go of her, you piece of trash! 

Hey, you will not get away with this!  That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.

What did he say?

Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?

Oh, it's awful! Just awful.

Wait a minute!  Where's Ike?!

Kyle? Kyle, what are you watchi-?!

So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?

And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."

But look what they put on. 

Oh,hello Eric.  Kyle, your friend is here.

Kyle!

Oh my God! 

I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--

Mommy loves you too, sweetie.

Kids! 

Where on earth could he be? 

Try again, bubbe!

Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it 

Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?

This is serious!

What?

Behold, the miracle of childbirth!

Doctor, what are you saying?

Miss Stevenson? Yes. She's very nice.

Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?

Well, hurry up!

Defiled? How?

Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!

Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them?

We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.

Kyle. 

Practice makes perfect, bubbe.

It is?

A new family moved in? Where are they from?

Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!

Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.

Oh, hi boys.

Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.

Kyle!

Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?

But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.

Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault

Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.

Don't touch me.

Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.

to make the dreidel spin

Toxins?

Kids are doing this?

Now when you learn

It looks quite inviting.

Goodbye, bubbe! Be careful!

Oh, I didn't realize.

Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon.

I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.

Do it harder, UPS man!

No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education.  From the school.

Here we go, Kyle Two.  And here's yours, Kyle. 

Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.

This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!

You'll know 

Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! 

Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. 

What is it, Kyle?

Ike? Kyle?

It's okay,  I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.

Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 

New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?

Oh, there he is.  Over here, Kyle! 

We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.

She has a dead fetus attached to her head.

Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.

He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.

He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.

Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.

Ike, eat your gefilte fish. 

Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!

Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.

Here they are!

Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.

My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.

Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?

Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.

Hoh boy.

How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?

Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!

How about the dreidl song, bubbe?

This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! 

Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.  Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.

Why?

Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.

You'll know

Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out in the street!

Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called "conjoined twin myslexia".

Are you going to do nothing?!

Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.

Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.

Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.

The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.

Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.

Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name. 

But who can we get to build it?

Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really? 

No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.

It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.

Kyle, it's just what some people do.

Hello?

You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. 

What what whaaat?

That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!

Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?

I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz. 

He's upstairs playing with all his friends.

Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.

You remember Uncle Gerry.

It'll work, it has to.

Kyle? You in there?

Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. 

For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?

Yes, but Kyle-

But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.  Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it! 

Kyle Two, he's your responsibility.

Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?

That's it, baby. That's it.

Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.

Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.

Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch!

Ohhh, thanks.

That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?

Who's that?

That's right, Kyle.

Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. 

We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.

Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! 

Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!

Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?

What are you talking about?

I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.

Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...

What-what-whaaat?!

Now, Kyle, come here.

Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.

Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father.  Ike, you will eat this!

You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. 

Ahhh.

Oh, Gerald...

Kyle, come back here! 

Well, why do you need one?

Oy..! Thank you, Chef.

AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!

Listen to your father, Kyle.

We'll talk about this later, Gerald!

Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now. 

Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! 

Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!

You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 

Whatwhatwhaaat?!  Me?! 

Don't lie to us, Kyle!

Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.

Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?

Just a little higher. 

Kyle, that is enough!

That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.

Yes?

Where are you going?!

Sharon, I'm so sorry.

You're giving them a missile??

Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!

Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you?

Kyle!  Kyle, you have to stop this! 

Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.

Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.

Keep spinning: learn

Kyle? Kyle!

Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.

I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.

We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.

Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK. 

Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...

Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.

Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.

Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.

At last, now we can return to normality.

Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.

Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.

Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?

That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.

Thank you. 

Whatwhatwhat?!

I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.

our people- know our people always win.

Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh? 

What the hell is this???  This is horrible!!!

It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.

Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray!

I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.

Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?

Eehh, sure, come in.  What is it?

Hold on, kids. 

Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.  You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins. 

Gerald! What happened to you?!

Kyle, open the door.

An abductor in our town?

Kyle, don't say such things!

That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.

Okay, boys. Get in the car.

Kyle, what are you talking about?

But you're more in touch with the earth.

Hello, boys!

He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. 

Now when you learn

Well, you're very welcome.

Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now! 

But what toy?

to make the dreidel spin 

No!

Kyle Two, where is Kyle?

Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!

No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.

Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!

Oh, he's growing up so fast! 

Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! 

It won't happen again. 

But then... are you saying...?

That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! 

Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. 

To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life.

It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.

Whatwhatwhaaat?!

Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.

Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.

Yes.

Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?

Hello bubbe, how was school today?

He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
