Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.

Now when you learn to make the dreidel spin
You'll know our people always win.
Keep spinning:
Learn

Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!  Waagghh!!  My baby!!

WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?

That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?

You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 

Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.

We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!  We want more quality television, like Full House. 

Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!

And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.

That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.

That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!

Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! 

Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! 

So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?

Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.

We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.

That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.

How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?

My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.

Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.

Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.

Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.  Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.

Hey, you will not get away with this!  That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.

I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.

We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!

And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."

Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.

Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.

Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.

Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. 

Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.

I thought it would be good for you.

Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father.  Ike, you will eat this!

Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.

Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.

A new family moved in? Where are they from?

Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.

Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. 

Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts!

But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!

Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.

Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...

Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!

Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?

It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.

Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.

That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.

Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.

No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 

There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?

Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.

Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!

No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.

What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?

It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.

I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.

Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?

Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you  Kyle, and you can be Kyle...  Two! 

We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.

You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.

Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now. 

Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault

No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.

I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--

Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.

I'll put it in the microwave right away. 

Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.

The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.

I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...

The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!

Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?

Oh, how precious! You boys are all playing dreidel. Now, you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the Hebrew people.

She has a dead fetus attached to her head.

Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!

Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.

Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.

Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.

For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?

Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!

But who can we get to build it?

Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?

Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. 

Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.

Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out in the street!

Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.

Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 

Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. 

Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--

That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.

Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.

Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?

They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!

You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!

To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life.

Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called "conjoined twin myslexia".

Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty!  Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! 

Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.

...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.

Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.

No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! 

Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!

We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.

I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. 

We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!

But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.  Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it! 

Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!

So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?

Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."

Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. 

Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!

I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.

Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.

Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.

He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.

Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...

How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?

No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.

Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!

So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?

Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.

HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!  This is your mother! You will open this door right now!

Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.

Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright?

No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.

Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 

All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. 

Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party.

It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.

Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. 

All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.

Let go of her, you piece of trash! 

Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.

Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?

We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.

He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.

People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?

I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.

Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?

Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. 

Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.

Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.

He left a note saying he's never coming back.

Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.

He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted. 

Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.

Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!

Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.

I've got a great game for you. It's called "ookie mouth".

My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.

He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! 

Here we go, Kyle Two.  And here's yours, Kyle. 

We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come! 

Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.

Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.  You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins. 

It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it. 

How dare you include the Nativity in a school play?  Don't you realize my son is Jewish?! 

Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.

It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important.

No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education.  From the school.

He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. 

Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.

This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?

But you're more in touch with the earth.

They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?

Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. 

All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!

I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.

It's okay,  I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.

Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.

Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it 

I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.

So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?

It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.

Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!

Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.

Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!

Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!

I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.

Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?

Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?  Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!

First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.

What the hell is this???  This is horrible!!!

Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?

Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?

Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!

We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.

Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now! 

So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?

Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?

Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?

That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! 

Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.

Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really? 

Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.

And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. 

Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!

Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.

They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.

To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."

At last, now we can return to normality.

Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?

Whatwhatwhaaat!!!  Come on everybody, back to New York! 

No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. 

You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!

Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.

We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.

Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!

Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.

Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.

He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.

Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!

Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!

It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.

Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!

So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?

Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!

Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!

I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.

I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.

This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! 

Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.

New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?

We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.

Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.

Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.

Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?

If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!  Ike, love?

Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.

Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!

Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.

Oh, of course!  Here you go.  Leaving so soon?

Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?

No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.  That ought to take care of it.

It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. 

Their grandmother's been dead for three years.  You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your-  mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!

There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?

Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. 

Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. 

That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.

Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.

Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! 

Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.

Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.

Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them?

We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.

I want to talk to you all about your school nurse. 

Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.

Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.

Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?

Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.

The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?  Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!  We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes. 

Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.
