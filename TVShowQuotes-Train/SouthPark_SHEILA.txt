For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?
Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.
People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
I want to talk to you all about your school nurse. 
That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.
Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.
Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?  Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!
There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?
The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?  Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!  We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes. 
Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. 
Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts!
We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.
Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.
Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.
Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery  that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?
How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them?
They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!
Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.
So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?
Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now. 
No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.
I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party.
Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!  Waagghh!!  My baby!!
We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come! 
Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?
Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. 
Let go of her, you piece of trash! 
Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?
Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.
Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.
Oh, of course!  Here you go.  Leaving so soon?
It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important.
We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!
Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.
Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.
But you're more in touch with the earth.
That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education.  From the school.
We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.
I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.
Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!
I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?
Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.
Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.
Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. 
I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright?
No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. 
It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it. 
Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father.  Ike, you will eat this!
I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.
How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life.
Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. 
Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.
Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! 
Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!
It's okay,  I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.
Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it 
Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!
Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?
How dare you include the Nativity in a school play?  Don't you realize my son is Jewish?! 
Here we go, Kyle Two.  And here's yours, Kyle. 
Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really? 
No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.
No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.  That ought to take care of it.
Whatwhatwhaaat!!!  Come on everybody, back to New York! 
We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!
...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.
Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!
Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now! 
That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.
So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?
Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!
These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!
Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?
Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!
Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. 
Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.
That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?
Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name. 
Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?
Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 
We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!
Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.  You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins. 
All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. 
Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?
Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! 
We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.
He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. 
But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.  Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it! 
Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!
Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.
We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.
A new family moved in? Where are they from?
I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.
First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.
Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...
Now when you learn to make the dreidel spin
You'll know our people always win.
Keep spinning:
Learn
Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!
Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called "conjoined twin myslexia".
I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.
Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out in the street!
My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.
It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.
Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!
Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.
Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.
It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. 
Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!
Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.
Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!
All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.
Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.
Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.
Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 
I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.
You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 
Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?
Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. 
Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. 
That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.
No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.
Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!
...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.
No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! 
Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.
She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. 
He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! 
Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you  Kyle, and you can be Kyle...  Two! 
Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. 
Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.
So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?
Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.
If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!  Ike, love?
Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!
That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
I thought it would be good for you.
No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 
The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.
Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?
Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.
I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.
Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."
Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault
Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change.
Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.
Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! 
They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
Oh, how precious! You boys are all playing dreidel. Now, you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the Hebrew people.
Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.
Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.
He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.
Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! 
Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.
Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.
Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
I'll put it in the microwave right away. 
Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.
To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."
New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?
Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.
Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
Their grandmother's been dead for three years.  You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your-  mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!
It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.
Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.
He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. 
Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.
Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.
No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.
That isn't all, Mayor!  The school play is doing a Nativity scene!  It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!
Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!
It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.
He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.
Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. 
Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--
Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.
I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.
We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!  We want more quality television, like Full House. 
And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."
All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.
My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.
At last, now we can return to normality.
Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.
It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.
So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
What the hell is this???  This is horrible!!!
Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! 
It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.
Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.
I've got a great game for you. It's called "ookie mouth".
Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.
You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!  This is your mother! You will open this door right now!
You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. 
Now, where did you leave him, young man?
WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.
It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty!  Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! 
This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?
Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.
Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted.
