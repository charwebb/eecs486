Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.
Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come! 
If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!  Ike, love?
Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.
Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.
Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!
You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. 
Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?
It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away.  Just really quick; she says it's very important.
Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.
Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.
That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.
And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean. 
Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. 
Oh, of course!  Here you go.  Leaving so soon?
It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.
Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!
It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?
No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?
Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.
No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 
Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now. 
Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...
They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!
Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.
No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education.  From the school.
To celebrate your little brother's  passage into life.
Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?
Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.
Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! 
It's very simple.  You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.
Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. 
We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! 
Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.
She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. 
We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.
We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.
And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.
Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?
All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. 
He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
How dare you include the Nativity in a school play?  Don't you realize my son is Jewish?! 
That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.
Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.
I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.
But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.  Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it! 
Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out in the street!
Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault
He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!
It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it. 
Now, where did you leave him, young man?
For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?
Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.
Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 
I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!
My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.
I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. 
Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.
Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.
It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.
People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.
What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?
Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.
Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.
Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring.
You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really? 
My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.
This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! 
All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!
Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?
I thought it would be good for you.
Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.
I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.
We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.
Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!
Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty!  Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! 
That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.
I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss. 
Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called "conjoined twin myslexia".
Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. 
But you're more in touch with the earth.
No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.  He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.
He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. 
But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!  We want more quality television, like Full House. 
So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!
Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?
So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
Whatwhatwhaaat!!!  Come on everybody, back to New York! 
Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.
Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!
Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. 
Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! 
Now when you learn to make the dreidel spin
You'll know our people always win.
Keep spinning:
Learn
Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?
But who can we get to build it?
Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. 
Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you  Kyle, and you can be Kyle...  Two! 
When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."
No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.
Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.
It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.
Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?
But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.
Ugh, please, just listen to me!  What about my children? Who will take care of them?
Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 
No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.
Here we go, Kyle Two.  And here's yours, Kyle. 
Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. 
Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!  Waagghh!!  My baby!!
Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.
I want to talk to you all about your school nurse. 
Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.
It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.
He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.
Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.
The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.
He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted. 
Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!
Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.
Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?  Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!  We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes. 
And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."
I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.
Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!
Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.
Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?
Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! 
The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!
I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!
What the hell is this???  This is horrible!!!
Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party.
Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--
Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes.  Are you alright?
Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father.  Ike, you will eat this!
I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.
Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?
Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.
Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.
Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!
Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
A new family moved in? Where are they from?
We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
Hey, you will not get away with this!  That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.
That isn't all, Mayor!  The school play is doing a Nativity scene!  It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!
Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. 
I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico.
No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! 
Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.
Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.  Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.
So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.
We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.  You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins. 
Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.
I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.
Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.
Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!
No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.  That ought to take care of it.
Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!
Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now! 
Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! 
Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.
WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!
Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.
So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?
That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. 
It's okay,  I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.
I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.
Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.
How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 
That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open!  Kyle?!  This is your mother! You will open this door right now!
Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.
These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!
Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though.
Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.
Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?
Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
At last, now we can return to normality.
Oh, how precious! You boys are all playing dreidel. Now, you know that dreidel is a time-honored tradition for the Hebrew people.
You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
I've got a great game for you. It's called "ookie mouth".
Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!
There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th-  Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you.
Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.
This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!
Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.
Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
Come on, Ike!  It's time to go to Squirts!
He left a note saying he's never coming back.
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. 
...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.
Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.
To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."
Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! 
Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.
Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.
Let go of her, you piece of trash!
