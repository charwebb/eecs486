Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
Hey... there he is.
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
Hey, let's watch this thing.
Sure.
She's gonna hate being a mom.
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
I am not an alcoholic!
Hel-lo!
Uh, we have. Countless times.
Yes.
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
Sack up, man.
Sure!  That sounds fun!
[chuckles] Walked right into that one.
I really want to come out!
Hotdogs are really unhealthy.
I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
I really want the iPod.
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
He���s screwed. They���re meeting in less than an hour.
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
How about a threesome?
Better.
This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
Hurry up already.
Thanks.
Better.
Yeah.
Right...
That apple looks delic!
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Crap. Sorry, Nellie.
I have no idea.
No duh. Let's go. You're buying.
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
It's coming off anyway.
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Yes.
I didn't want you it!
NO!!!
So what'd you bring us?
Yes!
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
That scowl.
I have a shirt like that in my car.
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
Seen and banged.
Yes.
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Forget about it.
I'm a hobo.
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Unless there's ribs. [leaves]
Ok, what do you think?
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
Hey, bottom drawer.
Hey!
No, I...I get it. It's funny.
Four-oh-two.
I'll take the oven mitt.
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...
Come on.
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
I think it looks good.
We have.
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
Ah, come on.
Yeah. Who said that?
When are you gonna boom me?
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
Surprise.
You hit me with your car!
You know it.  I am never getting married.
Tell me about it.
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
[breaks into the car] I'm in.
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
No, I... I get it. It's funny.
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
What���s with the blanket?
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
Obviously.
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
Uh, I can't. Um...
Thanks, hun.
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
Yeh, they're rich.
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
I know I drink. I like to party
Awesome!
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
Andy?
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It���ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
Okay. [remains sitting]
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Nice accent.  You sound like Forrest Gump.
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
No.  Something I can blackmail her with.
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Yes.
Annoying.
It's a couple streets over.
Damn it.
[dancing drunkenly] Ahh yeah!!
I'm not an alcoholic.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Wow.
To madness.
Really?
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
No way!  There is no way! No way!
Jim. [rolls eyes]
Okay, I was just warming it up.
Yeah... all right.
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
Hey!
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
The real problem is the teachers' union.
No, I get it.
Just relax. Okay.
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
[quickly] Erotic.
They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
I am fine.
Piss or get off the pot!
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
Suck it Oscar.
My kid didn���t have a face tattoo.
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
I'm so busted! Walk of shame!
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
...The Fort, Andy Gavin's.
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
You ready?
Hey jabroni. Show some class.
You have to! [everyone grumbling]
What are we gonna do?
Sweet! Free Ring!
One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
This is weird.
Darryl!
Don���t dog catch me!
I am so pissed at this company!
What should we do with all these leftovers?
Let me out!
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
Lose weight.
That is bull! [throws her Dundie]
Uh huh.
Um, I forgot my...
You're right. You're right. Yes.
Pathetic.
Shave her head. Shave her head!
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
Ass...turd.
At the same time.
Yahtzee.
Don't sign anything.
[starts singing] I come...
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don't need to tell me.
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
What's it say?
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
Hey! No way!
Yeah!
Oh, that's part of my dream too.
I like her nails.
Hey, where is the steak sauce?
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
Am I in trouble here or something?
Shh. It's on.
Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
Whoo! Brought some brain food.
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
You're gonna be here a
You're talking about my hysterectomy.
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
Ooh, where has this guy been?
That's cool.
Angela, what kind of music?
Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed.
I gotta see that little bitch.
Sorry.
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
Oh please, Michael.
She could be your soul mate.
Shut up. Jakey?
Wow!
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
That���s cheating.
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
Ow.
Yeah! Man in!
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
What?
Hey
[as all agree] OK.
This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Thank you!
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
How am I supposed to know what that is?
You're the closest one to it.
You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Wow.
Who gives a f[bleep]?
I'll take the teapot.
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
That town smells like cheese steaks.
Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier.
Boom!
Wow.
Hey, it's 5:00!
You have to go, Toby.
You can take my van!
Thank you.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Sweet.
Cool. Free upper.
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
[screams]
Frickin��� A!
Dwight, what the hell?
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
[takes mug] Yes.
She is an amazing actress.
Don't patronize me.
This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
Oh OOOH!
Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
It's my valuables!
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
Boo.
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
Hey, has anything happened yet?
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Are you sure?
Wow!
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
Yeah, you gotta know.
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
I already spent the money.
We're both girls. Who cares?
Maybe it wasn't.
We just missed Poor Richards.
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
I'll take them for my kid.
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
What I said was, ���My sister's funeral is this weekend.��� Didn't say I'd be there.
Because it's on my genitals, genius.
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
It's not a big deal.
Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
What the hell, Toby?
Booo! Weird.
[shocked expression]
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
What is the status on my wish?
I can't eat dairy.
Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.
I like her fingernails.
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
I am...
Whoa!
Who was messing with my van?
...Brixx's, Carmen's...
Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
Please to meet you-
Little Ms. Thing wants attention.
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
Oh my!
Sure.
His ass was on that seat? All right!
Where'd you get that salad?
Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
How much?
Oh...So..- how are you holding up?
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
Fine.  [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again]
Yeah that's better.
Why?
Sure.
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
Cake?...You seem a little down.
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
Looks good.
Just? Just what? Just forgot?
Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
Hey, boom guy.
Stop baggin��� my head!
Grow up.
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
Oh! Surprise.
Owww!
Slip.
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Tell us the freaking story!
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
SHUT UP ANGELA!
Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
Turn around.
Not yet!
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
You're welcome.
Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.
Yup, just a cold sore.
...Jim.
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
I really prefer devils food cake.
Oh, that's what they call it.
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
Speech!
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
Wait. Seriously?!
Did you spit in his face?
Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
I call loser!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
What?
Good night.
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
Oh, right.
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
I'm all right. I'm all right.
���Suck it losers.���
I am not going in there! NO!!
I hate that.
Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [Making kissing noises]
And a rat. Separate occasions.
You cracked my pelvis
In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
Make your own [bleep]in' sandwich.
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Whoo-hoo. Let���s get this party started!
All right!
Pam failed art school.
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Chunky monkey.
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
Wow.
Did you hear anything yet?
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
Hi.
Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
Hey, this ain't no Breakfast Club, bitch.
It didn't get torn off?
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
Thanks.
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
Like Clooney.
Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
He didn't smell like a drifter.
Yeah.  Jack, these are my co-workers.
What was your cell like?
There's nothing in here.
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
Well... I'm not quitting.
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
Me.
I don't remember.
Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
Damn it.
Hey Michael.
Seven grand?
A little better. I threw up.
Take a picture. It will last longer.
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
Topless Christmas.
...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
Good-timers follow me.
Am I getting fired?
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
Yeah. Wow.
Take a nap!
She hasn't popped yet.
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
Got it.
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
I'm not gonna grow a third arm!
Hey, what you doing right now?
Yeah, my neighbor got murdered.
Hell no. She wishes.
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
Don't pull any plugs.
No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
The Murphy bed of my basement.
Wrong. The answer is dyslexia!
No! No! No! No! No!
I just like the way it feels.
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
Where are we? This ain't my street.
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Surprise!
I wish Toby was still here.
Is there anybody else.
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
I have a lot of work to do.
How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
Wait, this is the entertainment?
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
Yeah!
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
[eating hot dog] What is it?
Uh, I also don't see Andy.
About what?
Thanks for bringing that up.
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
[tires screeching] Crap.
Maybe watch a movie...under a blanket...
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
Wow, so this building can get uglier.
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
You're not forgiven.
Yep.
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
How does one get a point?
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
Is there still something there?
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
We can drink?
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
[raises hand] I want to.
Pretend?  Or really make one?
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela���s throat]
I can't believe he has a second job.
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
Tear up the carpet!
Yeah.
It's stupid.
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
Shut it, Angela.
Thank you Santa.
[British accent] Hello.
Gerty's.
Fine, just give it.
It's just a van.
What?
I don't remember doing that.
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
[looks at ring, whispering] Wow...
