Whoo! Brought some brain food.
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
Little Ms. Thing wants attention.
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
Lose weight.
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
I am fine.
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
Take a nap!
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
All right!
Stop baggin��� my head!
No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
Hey, boom guy.
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
Uh, I can't. Um...
Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
It's stupid.
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
[British accent] Hello.
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Yes.
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Am I getting fired?
Thanks.
Thank you.
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
Hey!
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
Gerty's.
You ready?
I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
What's it say?
She's gonna hate being a mom.
That scowl.
How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
Whoa! My stuff!
The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
Sure.
Well... I'm not quitting.
Here you go.
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
What should we do with all these leftovers?
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
[starts singing] I come...
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
I have no idea.
Thanks, hun.
Yeah.
Shave her head. Shave her head!
Nice accent.  You sound like Forrest Gump.
You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
Forget you.
The weekend!
She hasn't popped yet.
No way!  There is no way! No way!
I'll take them for my kid.
Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
Am I in trouble here or something?
Who gives a f[bleep]?
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
I already spent the money.
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
I have a lot of work to do.
Is that a threat?
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
Awesome!
It's my valuables!
Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
I can't eat dairy.
Yeah, you gotta know.
That apple looks delic!
I like her nails.
Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
Yeah. Who said that?
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
Hotdogs are really unhealthy.
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
Thanks for bringing that up.
About what?
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
The main stone's missing.
Seven grand?
Wow.
Ah, come on.
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
Four-oh-two.
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
Wow!
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
Don't patronize me.
[eating hot dog] What is it?
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
What else?
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Four and a half.
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
My kid didn���t have a face tattoo.
Yeah. Wow.
Sure!  That sounds fun!
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
Get over yourself.
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
I wish Toby was still here.
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
Wow!
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don't need to tell me.
Cake?...You seem a little down.
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
Let me out!
Niagara Falls in October?  Pfft, hells yeah.
Hel-lo!
Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Chunky monkey.
Just? Just what? Just forgot?
Cool. Free upper.
Hey... there he is.
Oh, right.
Angela, what kind of music?
People in the other group.
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
Pretend?  Or really make one?
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
I don't want to!
I don't remember doing that.
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
She's got mean eyes.
Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
Hey remember that week in the 90���s when we got bagels?
Wrong. The answer is dyslexia!
Surprise.
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
What?
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...
[chuckles] Walked right into that one.
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
Tell me about it.
Pathetic.
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
Do it!
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
What is the status on my wish?
Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier.
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Why?
Me. Please.
Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Thanks.
I'm not an alcoholic.
What?
Oh OOOH!
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
Whoo-hoo. Let���s get this party started!
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
Yeah.  Jack, these are my co-workers.
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
[screams]
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
Sure.
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
Hey!
Don���t dog catch me!
Thank you Santa.
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
Ok, what do you think?
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
I really want to come out!
Yeah! Man in!
I don't want to say it out loud.
I gotta go.
[shocked expression]
Piss or get off the pot!
Did you hear anything yet?
Good night.
Hey, let's watch this thing.
What do you mean?
Tear up the carpet!
Hey, I was on the can. What���s this about a black guy in the office?
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
Frickin��� A!
Okay, I was just warming it up.
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
What are we gonna do?
Wait. Seriously?!
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Nice job.
Yeah, it makes me sick.
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
Just relax. Okay.
Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
I think it looks good.
Not yet!
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
Wow.
NO!!!
Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed.
You're welcome.
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
[takes mug] Yes.
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
It's a couple streets over.
I am so pissed at this company!
Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.
What I said was, ���My sister's funeral is this weekend.��� Didn't say I'd be there.
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
Dwight, what the hell?
Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.
Hi.
Hey, where is the steak sauce?
No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
Grow up.
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
Topless Christmas.
Did you spit in his face?
Hey, how did it go?
Hey Michael.
Damn it.
It's coming off anyway.
I didn't want you it!
Sweet! Free Ring!
[still laughing] I know.
What the hell, Toby?
Hey
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
She is an amazing actress.
No, I... I get it. It's funny.
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
I hate that.
Oh, that's part of my dream too.
Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [Making kissing noises]
His ass was on that seat? All right!
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
Anyway, I have this Sharpie...
Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela���s throat]
Maybe it wasn't.
���Suck it losers.���
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
I'm a hobo.
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
Speech!
Because it's on my genitals, genius.
What? What's wrong with my outfit?
Boo.
Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
Hey, what you doing right now?
We just missed Poor Richards.
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
It's just a van.
Slip.
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
That is something I would never do.
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
Better.
Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
It's no problem. You live right near me.
A little better. I threw up.
Is there still something there?
I like her fingernails.
So what'd you bring us?
You comin'?
Hey, this ain't no Breakfast Club, bitch.
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
You have to go, Toby.
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
Are you sure?
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
That���s cheating.
You know it.  I am never getting married.
Hey, has anything happened yet?
Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
Uh, two.
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
Hi, Pam.
Annoying.
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
[tires screeching] Crap.
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
Yeah!
The real problem is the teachers' union.
Yahtzee.
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
[breaks into the car] I'm in.
Three hundred and five.
That town smells like cheese steaks.
Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
Where'd you get that salad?
Where are we? This ain't my street.
Oh please, Michael.
Oh, that's what they call it.
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
This is weird.
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
That is bull! [throws her Dundie]
Sure.
Ow.
Uh, we have. Countless times.
Thank you!
Um... what about office romance?
[looks at ring, whispering] Wow...
You're the closest one to it.
We have.
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
How about a threesome?
I'll take the teapot.
Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
Seen and banged.
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Come on.
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...
Whoa!
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
What was your cell like?
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!
I can't believe he has a second job.
Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car]
Good-timers follow me.
It didn't get torn off?
Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?
I gotta see that little bitch.
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
Owww!
Andy?
You're not forgiven.
[comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
I got some in my minivan somewhere.
He didn't smell like a drifter.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
Tell us!
Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.
She could be your soul mate.
Wow, so this building can get uglier.
Shut up. Jakey?
This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
Surprise!
Don't pull any plugs.
Fine, just give it.
Sorry.
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
No duh. Let's go. You're buying.
I'm not sorry about it.
I'll take the oven mitt.
Hurry up already.
Please to meet you-
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
...Jim.
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
You're gonna be here a
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
Uh huh.
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
Hey, it's 5:00!
Got it.
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
Wow.
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Yep.
I'm so busted! Walk of shame!
Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
Yeah!
I'm not gonna grow a third arm!
I really prefer devils food cake.
At the same time.
...Brixx's, Carmen's...
Yes.
Yes.
No, I...I get it. It's funny.
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim]
You're right. You're right. Yes.
That's cool.
Hey jabroni. Show some class.
Oh...So..- how are you holding up?
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
Jim. [rolls eyes]
Uh, I also don't see Andy.
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Nothing.
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It���ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
You have to! [everyone grumbling]
Yeah right. With slammin��� bods like that, they ain���t playing checkers.
And a rat. Separate occasions.
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
My car, my rules.
It's not a big deal.
Wait, this is the entertainment?
Yeh, they're rich.
Sweet.
You're talking about my hysterectomy.
Don't sign anything.
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
Boom!
Um, I forgot my...
I really want the iPod.
Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.
To madness.
Sack up, man.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
Right...
Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
Yeah that's better.
We're both girls. Who cares?
Yup, just a cold sore.
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Darryl!
Better.
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
Damn it.
Talk about vacation days!
SHUT UP ANGELA!
What���s with the blanket?
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
Forget about it.
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
No thanks. They're too sweet.
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
The Murphy bed of my basement.
How much?
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
Booo! Weird.
We can drink?
Maybe watch a movie...under a blanket...
Ass...turd.
I just like the way it feels.
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
What do we get if we do 'em?
Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
Please don't tell a sailor joke.
He calls it an upper decker.
Unless there's ribs. [leaves]
Ooh, where has this guy been?
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
Okay. [remains sitting]
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
He���s screwed. They���re meeting in less than an hour.
Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?
I am...
Well, it must have just opened up.
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
How does one get a point?
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
Wow.
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
[dancing drunkenly] Ahh yeah!!
You're right. You're right. Yes.
[quickly] Erotic.
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
You cracked my pelvis
Who was messing with my van?
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
Tell us the freaking story!
In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Yeah... all right.
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
Obviously.
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
Oh! Surprise.
I know I drink. I like to party
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
Ow! Take it easy.
There's nothing in here.
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
Make your own [bleep]in' sandwich.
You hit me with your car!
Hey, bottom drawer.
Fine.  [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again]
Hey! No way!
Take a picture. It will last longer.
I am not going in there! NO!!
Like Clooney.
Yes!
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
