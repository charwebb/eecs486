Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela���s throat]
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don't need to tell me.
No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
I have a shirt like that in my car.
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
You know it.  I am never getting married.
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
I don't want to say it out loud.
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It���ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
What do we get if we do 'em?
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
What should we do with all these leftovers?
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
What I said was, ���My sister's funeral is this weekend.��� Didn't say I'd be there.
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
He���s screwed. They���re meeting in less than an hour.
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
Yeah right. With slammin��� bods like that, they ain���t playing checkers.
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
How am I supposed to know what that is?
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I know I drink. I like to party
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
I have a lot of work to do.
His ass was on that seat? All right!
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
No way!  There is no way! No way!
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.
Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
It's no problem. You live right near me.
