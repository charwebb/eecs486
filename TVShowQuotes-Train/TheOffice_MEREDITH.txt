[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
I know I drink. I like to party
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.
I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
I have a lot of work to do.
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
I have a shirt like that in my car.
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
How am I supposed to know what that is?
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don't need to tell me.
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
You know it.  I am never getting married.
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
I don't want to say it out loud.
I can't believe he has a second job.
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Hey remember that week in the 90���s when we got bagels?
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
What I said was, ���My sister's funeral is this weekend.��� Didn't say I'd be there.
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
His ass was on that seat? All right!
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
[comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
Yeah right. With slammin��� bods like that, they ain���t playing checkers.
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Hey, I was on the can. What���s this about a black guy in the office?
What should we do with all these leftovers?
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It���ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
It's no problem. You live right near me.
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
No way!  There is no way! No way!
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
What do we get if we do 'em?
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
