Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
What do we get if we do 'em?
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
I can't believe he has a second job.
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
I don't want to say it out loud.
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
You know it.  I am never getting married.
Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
It's no problem. You live right near me.
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela���s throat]
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
Yeah right. With slammin��� bods like that, they ain���t playing checkers.
How am I supposed to know what that is?
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don't need to tell me.
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
I know I drink. I like to party
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
Hey, I was on the can. What���s this about a black guy in the office?
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
What should we do with all these leftovers?
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said 'Gross'...
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
What I said was, ���My sister's funeral is this weekend.��� Didn't say I'd be there.
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
No way!  There is no way! No way!
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
Hey remember that week in the 90���s when we got bagels?
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
He���s screwed. They���re meeting in less than an hour.
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
I have a shirt like that in my car.
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
[comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
I have a lot of work to do.
Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
His ass was on that seat? All right!
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It���ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
