That is something I would never do.
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
What?
Hey, let's watch this thing.
[starts singing] I come...
Well, it must have just opened up.
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
What?
To madness.
Damn it.
She could be your soul mate.
Me. Please.
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
Cool. Free upper.
How about a threesome?
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
So what'd you bring us?
He didn't smell like a drifter.
Forget you.
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
Tell us!
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
That town smells like cheese steaks.
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
We're both girls. Who cares?
Suck it Oscar.
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
I don't want to!
This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
People in the other group.
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
You comin'?
Yeah.
Maybe watch a movie...under a blanket...
I can't eat dairy.
Am I getting fired?
We have.
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
A little better. I threw up.
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
I am so pissed at this company!
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
Hi.
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
I wish Toby was still here.
No.  Something I can blackmail her with.
Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
Crap. Sorry, Nellie.
I didn't want you it!
Maybe it wasn't.
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
My kid didn���t have a face tattoo.
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
I think it looks good.
It's coming off anyway.
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It���ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
It's no problem. You live right near me.
[comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
Lose weight.
There's nothing in here.
You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
Oh...So..- how are you holding up?
Oh my!
Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
I call loser!
Hey, what you doing right now?
Hell no. She wishes.
I really want to come out!
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
No way!  There is no way! No way!
Don't sign anything.
I'm a hobo.
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
Yes.
You hit me with your car!
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
Wow!
Do it!
Hey... there he is.
Get over yourself.
No duh. Let's go. You're buying.
I'll take them for my kid.
It's not a big deal.
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
Yeah. Who said that?
Yes.
Not yet!
This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
Sweet! Free Ring!
Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.
Boo.
No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
How much?
Wait. Seriously?!
What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim]
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
I'll take the teapot.
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
His ass was on that seat? All right!
Ass...turd.
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
Thank you Santa.
Oh, that's part of my dream too.
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
You have to go, Toby.
Well... I'm not quitting.
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
Booo! Weird.
I'm not an alcoholic.
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
I already spent the money.
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
Let me out!
Yeah right. With slammin��� bods like that, they ain���t playing checkers.
I don't remember.
Thanks, hun.
Grow up.
I gotta see that little bitch.
Got it.
Don't patronize me.
[still laughing] I know.
I like her nails.
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
What do we get if we do 'em?
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
Good-timers follow me.
No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
Fine.  [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again]
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
Oh, right.
Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
Wow.
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
What else?
Andy?
Man, he���s really in twinkle town now.
Whoo! Brought some brain food.
Damn it.
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
Better.
Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
Oh, that's what they call it.
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
[raises hand] I want to.
...Brixx's, Carmen's...
Tell me about it.
Hey remember that week in the 90���s when we got bagels?
Why?
Ah, come on.
Sweet.
Yep.
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Angela, what kind of music?
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
No thanks. They're too sweet.
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
Wow, so this building can get uglier.
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
What are we gonna do?
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
[British accent] Hello.
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
Talk about vacation days!
Yes.
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
Uh, two.
Um... what about office romance?
I got some in my minivan somewhere.
Whoo-hoo. Let���s get this party started!
Hey, I was on the can. What���s this about a black guy in the office?
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
Gerty's.
What should we do with all these leftovers?
Really?
I'm so busted! Walk of shame!
I don't want to say it out loud.
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
Nothing.
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
You're welcome.
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
Uh, I also don't see Andy.
Pathetic.
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
Yeh, they're rich.
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
[takes mug] Yes.
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
That���s cheating.
You know it.  I am never getting married.
You're talking about my hysterectomy.
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
Yes!
Take a nap!
No! No! No! No! No!
It's my valuables!
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
[quickly] Erotic.
Thanks for bringing that up.
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
Hey Michael.
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
Oh OOOH!
Uh huh.
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
Wrong. The answer is dyslexia!
Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
Thanks.
I have a shirt like that in my car.
No, I...I get it. It's funny.
Nice job.
Wow.
Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier.
Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
Like Clooney.
I really want the iPod.
Dwight, what the hell?
Unless there's ribs. [leaves]
Did you spit in his face?
How does one get a point?
Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.
Wow.
Sack up, man.
What���s with the blanket?
Whoa! My stuff!
You're not forgiven.
That scowl.
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Anyway, I have this Sharpie...
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
We can drink?
I can't believe he has a second job.
And a rat. Separate occasions.
You're gonna be here a
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
The real problem is the teachers' union.
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
[screams]
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
[breaks into the car] I'm in.
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Shave her head. Shave her head!
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.
What is the status on my wish?
���Suck it losers.���
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
Come on.
Yup, just a cold sore.
Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
Ooh, where has this guy been?
No, I get it.
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
Okay. [remains sitting]
What? What's wrong with my outfit?
Four and a half.
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
I am not going in there! NO!!
I don't remember doing that.
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
[chuckles] Walked right into that one.
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
Uh, I can't. Um...
Shh. It's on.
Yeah!
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
Little Ms. Thing wants attention.
Awesome!
Turn around.
It's a couple streets over.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
Sure.
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Jim. [rolls eyes]
Wow.
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
[tires screeching] Crap.
That apple looks delic!
I hate that.
Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
The main stone's missing.
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
Yeah that's better.
Hey
Hel-lo!
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Sure!  That sounds fun!
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela���s throat]
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
Is there anybody else.
Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
I have a lot of work to do.
Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
Who was messing with my van?
Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [Making kissing noises]
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
Hey!
I don't care what everyone thinks.  I know I am not an alcoholic.
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.
Hurry up already.
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
You have to! [everyone grumbling]
Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
Thank you.
Um, I forgot my...
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
Yeah, my neighbor got murdered.
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Yeah... all right.
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
Okay, I was just warming it up.
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
When are you gonna boom me?
No, I... I get it. It's funny.
Wait, this is the entertainment?
Yeah. Wow.
SHUT UP ANGELA!
I'm not sorry about it.
At the same time.
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
It's just a van.
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
My car, my rules.
Owww!
How am I supposed to know what that is?
Who gives a f[bleep]?
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
...The Fort, Andy Gavin's.
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
Yeah, it makes me sick.
Is there still something there?
Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
I gotta go.
Hey, champagne.
Yeah, you gotta know.
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don't need to tell me.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
Oh! Surprise.
One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...
I'm all right. I'm all right.
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
Cake?...You seem a little down.
Hey, where is the steak sauce?
How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed.
Annoying.
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
Shut up. Jakey?
I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
It didn't get torn off?
Forget about it.
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
[looks at ring, whispering] Wow...
Ow! Take it easy.
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
Chunky monkey.
Please to meet you-
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
What do you mean?
Frickin��� A!
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
You're right. You're right. Yes.
I know I drink. I like to party
You ready?
Stop baggin��� my head!
[shocked expression]
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
NO!!!
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
Tear up the carpet!
Uh, we have. Countless times.
We just missed Poor Richards.
What?
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
The Murphy bed of my basement.
Pretend?  Or really make one?
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
About what?
Sure.
That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
I just like the way it feels.
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
Ok, what do you think?
The weekend!
Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
Topless Christmas.
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
He���s screwed. They���re meeting in less than an hour.
[eating hot dog] What is it?
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
It's stupid.
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
That's cool.
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
Here you go.
Sorry.
All right!
Hotdogs are really unhealthy.
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
Is that a threat?
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
What the hell, Toby?
Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?
Thank you.
Right...
Wow!
Niagara Falls in October?  Pfft, hells yeah.
Ow.
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
Four-oh-two.
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
Just? Just what? Just forgot?
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Hey, has anything happened yet?
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
That was in your way?
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Hey, bottom drawer.
Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
I'm not gonna grow a third arm!
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
Oh please, Michael.
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
Three hundred and five.
Slip.
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
You're the closest one to it.
He calls it an upper decker.
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
Boom!
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
You can take my van!
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Shut it, Angela.
I have no idea.
You cracked my pelvis
Yahtzee.
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Hey jabroni. Show some class.
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
I am fine.
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
Nice accent.  You sound like Forrest Gump.
Yeah.  Jack, these are my co-workers.
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
Surprise.
Pam failed art school.
...Jim.
I really prefer devils food cake.
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
What was your cell like?
Yeah! Man in!
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
Me.
That is bull! [throws her Dundie]
Did you hear anything yet?
I am...
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
Whoa!
Yeah!
Hey, it's 5:00!
Piss or get off the pot!
