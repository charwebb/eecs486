Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
These guys took me out on their fishing boat.  I don't think I caught anything.
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
His ass was on that seat? All right!
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
[on the phone, while getting sprayed] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It���ll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
Maybe we���re s���posed to do it with people in our group.
How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
I'll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
You know it.  I am never getting married.
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
Alright. [Andy opens back of her van, things fall out]
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
I don't want to say it out loud.
So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
What should we do with all these leftovers?
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
No way!  There is no way! No way!
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
Hey remember that week in the 90���s when we got bagels?
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
What do we get if we do 'em?
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
I know I drink. I like to party
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
[runs away] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!  No! No!
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
How am I supposed to know what that is?
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
[comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
[walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
What I said was, ���My sister's funeral is this weekend.��� Didn't say I'd be there.
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
Shut up and let me do this! [hangs up] You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs.  I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
I can't believe he has a second job.
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela���s throat]
All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
I have a shirt like that in my car.
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
I have a lot of work to do.
Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
It's no problem. You live right near me.
Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
Yeah right. With slammin��� bods like that, they ain���t playing checkers.
