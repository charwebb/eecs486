Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
[seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird sex thing.
Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
[sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
This is from Michael. 'Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
If I ever get that bad, you���d tell me, right?
See you guys. [chorus of goodbyes, all but Michael file out as he's talking, Creed takes Meredith's pills]
See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
I'm sorry. [hangs up] You're here to sell me some paper.
What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
I have a shirt like that in my car.
I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
[talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
[reading the game box cover] Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
Gotta get in shape. I'm doing Ironman next month. And I want him to be attracted to me.
I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
Yeah right. With slammin��� bods like that, they ain���t playing checkers.
Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
I can't believe he has a second job.
[putting mayo on Stanley's head] You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
I'm getting fired, aren't I?  I can't get fired.  I got nothing else.  Nothing.  No skill set.  Can't type, bad on the phone, not great with people.
That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? [phone rings] Sorry. Yeah?
Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn���t fart on a butterfly.
That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
I have a lot of work to do.
Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela���s throat]
[holding a pack of cigarettes] Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
Always with the friends Oscar. Can���t we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture]
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
Look, I know my way around a van.  That is just a van.
You know it.  I am never getting married.
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
Well I just hate being treated like some bum with no class. I'm a lady. I'm a mother. I'm a former boxer!
Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
[to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
[laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
How about I fix you some warm milk with some bourbon?
Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Why are all the best-looking single men always gay?
No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
Come on, how did you propose? Spill it. Were you wasted?
I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
What should we do with all these leftovers?
Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, ���Talk classy, act nasty���.
I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
[entering office] Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
[whispers] I'll read this when I get home.
Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?
It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Ok, I met him in a bar, right? There's something weird about him. He doesn't smell right, the clothes are all tattered and dirty and from another age. Anyways, we end up back and my place and we go at it all night-
Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
Thanks. I wish I could've had it. Do you wanna trade?
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
[Scoffs] We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
Stanley, didn't she say a bunch of racist stuff to you?
[lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?
[slurping her from her big cup] I don't know why I'm not in The Finer Arts Club [slurring].  It's bullcrap. [throws her cup on the floor, something splashes on the camera]  You clean it up.
That was Stanley. 'Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam.'
You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
[seeing Michael drink from wine bottle] Michael! [bottle gets passed around by Darryl, Meredith and Kevin]
Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
[to Martin] I love your complexion. It's like devil's food cake.
Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
I hate that bitch.  I wanna cut her face. [Dwight walks by and hears]
More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.
[drinks] Oh... my... GOD!!!  [laughs] Hit me again.
[After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
Holly.  She's on the warpath.  She is gunning for all our jobs.  Do you guys have any dirt on her?
Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
[shaving her own head] Yes, Pam what do you want?
I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen.
Where else am I gonna get another job that lets me come it at eleven and leave at four?
There is no way!  There is no way! No! No!
Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
Enough of this Christmas crap.  Let's get some party music. [changes radio station]  Yeah!
I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction.  I do.  To porn.
How am I supposed to know what that is?
Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird.
I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
I wake up the next morning, all my stuff's gone. Whole house turned over. No trace. You tell me what happened.
I don't want to say it out loud.
I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.
No! No way! I told you. We talked about this.  There is absolutely no way.  No!  No! There is no way!  No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
[walking in] Hey guys! [Angela leaves the table, exhales as she exits the room]
Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
His ass was on that seat? All right!
[continuing to dance, lifting her shirt] Belly dancing!
Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
Sure you don���t want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
I'm still recovering from last night. But maybe.
Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do? [she writes 'sex with a terrorist']
Drunk?  No!  You can't get drunk off Kahlua.  It's just a kind of coffee.
What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head]
[Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
Crotch injuries are the worst.  You don't need to tell me.
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
Because I was there. [shows Kelly her cell phone video] Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
One more kid calls me 'Hellboy,' I swear to God...
Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Sunrise Rehab?  No! No! No!  I told you no! There is no way!
When a woman gets older, she'll go just about anywhere with just about anyone. I've done some things I'm not so proud of, but I've seen the world.
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail?
[comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
Happy Bird-day' Um... 'Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.'
I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
It's no problem. You live right near me.
Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
[notices Karen has same thermos as herself] Hey. That's funny.
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in]
Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
[under her breath] get a divorce...get a divorce...
Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
You weren't even in the room!  Thanks for nothing.
[jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
[walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
Guys, do we have to stay all day?
[stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
Hey remember that week in the 90���s when we got bagels?
He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
Bye! [Kevin's horn honks twice shortly, then one long honk. Shot shows him passed out on his steering wheel.]
What I said was, ���My sister's funeral is this weekend.��� Didn't say I'd be there.
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
I'll go.  Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
[to herself] Be careful. [yells as boxes fall on her] Hello? I'm stuck!
I know I drink. I like to party
Whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute.  What is the etiquette on taking the gifts?  Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
Hey, I was on the can. What���s this about a black guy in the office?
Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
And it looks like you're taking a dump.
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
You smell like a Scorpio. [Ryan enters] This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
[to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?
Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place?
Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
No way!  There is no way! No way!
So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
[stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
[holds out flask] Do you want a little?
Nurse!  I just need some water.  And my pills.  Thank you.
Okay. If you change your mind, you just let me know, okay?
Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
[as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard?
Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
He���s screwed. They���re meeting in less than an hour.
No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
No way!  No way!  There is no way!
Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.'
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
