You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!
He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.
I'm impressed.  And I'd like to be your manager.
Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points.
You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you! 
That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. 
You've gotta pull it together!  Pull it together, Goddammit!
Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowheres. Just listen to that video crowd.  I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings.
No!  Nobody plays Heroin Hero just a little! You know, you never catch the dragon!
You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.
No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days
What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! 
Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do.  Check this out.  Pretty damn good, huh?
You'd better pull your act together, because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!
Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.
You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course.  Ah, Thad!  Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.
Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play.
That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad? 
I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back.
No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.
Marsh? Stan, you got-  Oh my God!  Get up, Stan! Wake up!
