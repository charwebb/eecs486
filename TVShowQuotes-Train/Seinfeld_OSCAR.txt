These aren't announcements.
No, I'm not gay.  And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay.
Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?
Now? It's our Christmas party.
Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Easy.
Hello.
I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
Like what?
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
Pam... I think Robert is gay.
Go to the recorded version.
An octagon is a shape.  You can see shapes, can't you?
What did you end up with?
This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?
You know the octagon sign means stop.
You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
I think we can do it.
Salman Rushdie.
No, it's fine.
Kelly's on your side.
[whispering] Please. It���s Robert who���s enjoying it.
...Andy.
I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
Okay.
Why aren't you in New York?
Ow! Robert?!
To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Well, you have no right to ask those questions.
Andy bought lunch.
It's fair.
What are you doing?
Sure. Hoops!
Let me call you back.
I don't know.
No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
I hope that's it, Kevin.
Dwight. Hey.
Hey Michael.
Those are the bullet points.
Well, there must be someone who stands out.
In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
Totally, they're the best.
They can.
And you guys thought this was a good idea?
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
It was an amateur production, technically.
What time do we have to come in?
Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Martinez.
For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table]
I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
Erin, what are you doing?
Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background]
Angela, you look amazing.
Michael, this is a presentation tool.
Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.
Everybody shut up and work!
[Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
How could anyone stand that woman?
Good luck.
She's the one.
Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her!
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
In this case yes.
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
Oh you?
[dropping desk drawer] This doesn���t... I���m sorry. Wha... what?
It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
You're too heavy!
Hey.
No, thank you, Angela.
I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam.
This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron]
No, no, please. Please do not do this.
It's a scoreboard.
Tasteless.
[yelling at Michael in Spanish]
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]
I'd love to talk more about it.
Your office is full of genitalia.
The Atlantic.
Huh?
I don���t know, Angela. I���m dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
Yes.
���The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton���s own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!���
I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
It was fine.
That's great, man.
Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
Pleased to meet you.
Who's is it? Who wrote that?
[with horns honking] Kevin, can-
Sure.
Can I say...?
But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
There's no theater in that.
I was going to be in New York tonight, to go to the Met, but I had to cancel.  Because Angela's party is mandatory.
I should step into sales myself.
Okay.
That's funny.
I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
What happened in Michael's office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it... it was still wrong.
Why?
You're forty-three.  Mick Jagger's like sixty-five.
Did you Google Confucius and just print out the first thing you saw?
[opens door] Michael.
It was insane!
[to Kevin] Separate cars.
Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
Kevin?
Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
Wow.
This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
This could be the affair that you���re scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. [pause] But uh, he���s probably not gay. He���s straight. He���s straight, so...
Hey, Rockefeller Center!
It's not fair, you guys.
Look, I'm just saying that there are many people that are offered by your insensitive skits.
[his phone vibrates] He stopped it!
It's really not.
Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
What?
I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
Okay, that's enough, uh.  Thanks, Andy.
[whispers] Case Logic.
Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
Very much so.
Hey, Michael.
Angela, Blake���s also a guy���s name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
The one of all women?
Is everything okay?
That's too funny.
Five years?
It's just...
As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
What?
Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
[clears throat more loudly]
Can I just say one thing? Um, my friend is Jewish, Art Geller. And a couple of years ago he, um, showed me how you can plant a tree in Israel, so I planted a tree. So... You know 'cause... Yeah we work in paper. Well, you know, I try to give back.
Okay.
Oh, come on.
Come on buddy, get back.
Just- no.  No.
Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
Angela, you still have your son.
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
Yeah.
You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Can you do this, Kevin?
My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
I think the problem with this office is that
Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
I think you know.
I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
Ten percent?
[noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Oh...
Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
What I mean to say is we don't want to.
We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
Thank... Yeah...
Like what?
Because I'm gay?
Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
No kidding.
Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
Michael I need to talk to you.
[phone vibrates, rings]
I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Home is where the
I'm reporting you.
Why would I love jail?
Oh... hey.
[on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
That's impossible.
Angela, until you face that, you���re gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won���t stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
I have the chills.
So ten
Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
Jan.
[laughs] Mm.  Yeah.
Ok!
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
Kelly had me last year, too, and she gave me the same exact thing. I only have one shower.
Yeah sure.
This is interesting.
Stop hitting me!
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
It���s a thing. It means ���you only live once���.
If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
Michael --
I got it.
This is a lot of credit card debt.
She doesn���t know. I shouldn���t be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
He said he wanted me there for support.
Man, I really wanted that. I really wanted the shower radio, too.
My mother's in a wheelchair.
My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
Because we're looking up jail time.
You sound pretty defensive Michael.
How can we not watch this?
That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim]
You're not gonna answer the phone?
[on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
No.
No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
[in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
I don't know.
What is this?
Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
Okay, Toby, I gotta go.
How was Friday night?
Mm-hmm.
Hi.
One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
I'm in big trouble.
I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
Dwight.
What was that?
I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
Do you know?
Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or...
It wasn't me.
Yeah.
No.
U..s..a. U-
How can you live with yourself?
[as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
[to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
Mmm.
Well, I am sorry Kevin.
I'll get him water.
I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
You pushed Darryl out the window?
That isn't ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?
Oh, that's very funny.
Put the 'q' there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled.
Brava!
Bankruptcy?
Yeah, he's in a ladle.
I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
The note.  So 'holier than thou'.
Can't you just tell us.
[cuts back to a Happy Birthday cake gushing blood when cut into, a doll melts, a woman eats food and puckers her face] Is that my grandmother?
No! Come on!
I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Meredith!
Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
Maybe over some coffee later?
Meredith, I-
Just chocolate. Angela? For the last time, I did not eat your chocolate-vanilla swirl.
Don't you want to see the baby?
I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
WASSUUUUP! [laughing]
I'm in.
Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
I just told them to do it!
Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!
why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair.  I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. [turns to see Kevin has overheard him]...Why?
Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?
Last year, he walked 18 miles.
You have an address yet in Colorado?
I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Oh, for God���s sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb]
[in phone] No, no. Finish the...
Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That���s it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
We got it! Wow! We got it!
[sits at his desk] Hi, Angela.
I thought you were already engaged.
[to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
Nice to meet you Mark!
[seeing Kevin throw out bunch of M&Ms]  Nice job, Kevin. [Kevin fills jar back up with another candy]
[talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we���re good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to..
When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
Un-be-liev-a-ble.
We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
Michael, do you know what secular humanism is?
I had a good time too.
They finally let you do it!
No, they just made out.  That's it.
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
I don���t know what you���re talking about.
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
[undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
I am dying to know what's in there.
Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.
What?
Yeah, it was.
No thank you.
Maybe you're right, who are we to...
For me.
Exactly!
I never suggested...
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
That's offensive.
The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
It's my job to keep the books in order. And, um, I... I'm, uh, immediately below my supervisor.
Hey, Jim.
What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
You're clearly snooping.
Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between 'sane and others.' Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The 'coalition for reason' is extremely weak.
It gets better, kids. It gets so much better that one day, your stupid coworkers will be excited to show up at your gay bar and ruin your trivia night.
Thank God.
Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
Okay. I'm done with this.
Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.
It stands for electromagnetic field.  Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area [Erin marks red tape X on the floor] Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
100 dollars.
What's the next one?
A triple word.
No, no. Not even.
Yeah!
Interesting. Every culture holds this true. Clearly, there's some sort of real phenomenon out there...
Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]
I don't think he meant, that--
[laughs] That's disgusting.
What?
Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
You really have to say 'oh yeah' every time you eat a candy bar?
I, uh, huh, just [chuckles nervously]
I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
Yeah.
It's not pizza.
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
Who's the senator?
I was stupid, I told him.
[clicks tongue] Aw...
Is that true, Toby?
[after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
What? What?
No, I���m a dog person.
You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
This is not good.
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
Just leave it how you said...
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
It's just not prudent Michael.
Argh!
What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
Whoo, whoo, whoo.
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
Angela, you just were���
I'm good.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
Yes.
What the hell?!
Yeah, I feel terrible about it.
Turkey is a healthy meat.
Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
Who are you dating in the public arena?
[in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
How would anyone even know--
Why won't you do Andy?
Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
[Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow!
My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
That's as simple as I can make it.
I totally see that. [looking at spreadsheet]
Put the 'q' there, sweetie.
Since Christmas.
Stanley, could you look up 'accomplices'?
Actually, it���s pronounced ���espresso������ Wait. That���s what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So���
Well, I bet it was a smash.
That's a tough one.
Good morning. [clears throat]
It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
You're the one who said we needed more culture.
I forgive you for kissing me!
That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me.  Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great.
The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
Who is that?
You said that yesterday.
Where was that.
[rings bell, answers in French] Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
Ok
Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
Yes.
There he is.
Yes!
I'm on a call.
What?
[noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
So what do you think?
There's no proof of that.
He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
What happened to Phyllis?
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
You--- you call--- you called her.
I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
you are incorrigible!
[laughing]
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
Yes.
Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
Wha-
Mmm...
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
Hey, Hey Robert!
What's your point.
That's a lot.
Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
It was crazy.
Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
Order reference number 00983-126.
Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
Mummies are real.  There are mummies at museums.
Andy, no-
Actually it is the northernmost.
Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
Someone please explain it to Kevin.
Jim, you let Michael fall in.
I don't know if it'll be shorter to fly. [Holly gasps] You have to drive to Boston, right? That's an hour and a half. Get there an hour before the flight. Now you're up two and a half hours. The flight to Philadelphia is an hour fifteen. It's another two and a half hour drive to Scranton, assuming there's no traffic, because....
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
It's maddening!
Yes!
Is that Chet Montgomery?
David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs]
Just ��� I don���t wanna make assumptions based on people���s physical appearances.
Come on Michael. You can...
I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
Wow.  Now we can afford hard-cover books.
I think I'll just take my chances.
Wow.
My parents were Mexican.
All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
It's not misleading.
Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
[Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it.
Can you turn the heat down now - it's oppressive.
Those figures I gave you? They're false.
She's beautiful.
Nuh uh.
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  'On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's.  It is rumored that they will recommend... ' and the article cuts off.
Come stay with me.
Would you, please? Please.
Creed.
I'm messing with you, Holly.
Is Matt around? I got his check.
You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
Exactly, Andy.
Yes. [small fist-pumps from both Pam and Oscar.]
Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
Bulk or definition?
Can we see that? Did you really find it?
Kevin!
She has to know.
Pass.
[Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?
Plus everyone would know who you meant.
It's possible.
This constitutes identity fraud.
Let it ride. Let it all ride.
You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
I cannot believe how condescending Andy's being.
I know.
[Toby and Oscar swig from wine bottles] Oh, Mineral-ey.
I'm asking about Certificates of Deposit.
Yes.
Use it in a sentence.
So...
Thank you, Michael.
Kevin!
No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
Pam, what can be done?
Yes, she is. And clinically insane.
Which on in particular?
Manual.
I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
What is that?
Still, that's not anything.
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
[sigh] What happened, Pam?
Yes!
Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss]
������C-SPAN���?
I can't.
Who���s spotting who? Don���t use the bike in the corner. That���s Bruce���s. Jeremy says���
Done!
Me too.
You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
Yeah.
Fine.
Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
Actually I���m the electoral college.
Wow.
I'm pretty fit.  But in the gay community, there's a lot of pressure to be ripped.  I got straight abs.  I want gay abs.
We are together. Romantically.
Well���
No, Kevin -- [sighs]
Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were���slave owners.
Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
Michael, This is insane.
He put me here.
Okay.
Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
My mom. [puts card in pocket]
What are you doing?!
I couldn't understand a word he said.
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
Hello?
Why haven't we heard anything? It's 4:45. There's only 15 minutes left.
Separate bathrooms.
Perfect.
It's like a pay decrease.
And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds]
Why?
This is why I'm here?
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
Okay, did you get it out of your system.
Oh my God, what happened?
Will you marry me?
[seeing Michael on the bus] Michael. Get off the bus.
I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
Why are you telling us this?
It just feels like a slap in the face.
What have you been doing?
Here.
I think of him as more like... a monster?  What about, 'I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!'
What are you talking about? I just did this now.
How do you even know they're gay?
Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Yes?
What?
Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know.
When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
What's your money situation?
No, I have not.
[laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.
What if it were salads?
Well...
All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
Sweet!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Andy, there is no switching teams.
I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
With all due respect we know what we���re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Are you saying Kevin is not an ideal specimen?
How long do you take to pee?
I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
[whispers] So!?
[laughs]
That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
You wanted to see me?
All right. I can do that. Then what?
You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
I... like your hair.  I don't know if I told you.
And that's how the printing press was invented.
Why would someone hug you?
[hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.
Right.
How long do you think a week is?
We do a lot more than that.
Yes. Sorry about that.
Meaning what?
Jan, he went running that way.
Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
Hold on, hold on, what's going on?
Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
Thank you.
Wow.
Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
I want to know.
She���s repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
���Loyalty pledge���?
YOLO! [singing and dancing]
[stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs]
Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
Stay alive!  I'm getting help!
I'd like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
Dwight please!
I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Forty-two.
Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
OK, the health care plan.
We were never lovers!
Didn't we? I think we did.
The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
That's tasteless, Gabe.
I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.
[Kelly faints] Oh!
Hey.
Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
Right there.
Okay.
Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.
These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
I don't even wanna know these things!
You have CDs?
Oh...
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
Listen to this.
I���ll watch it. Let���s get this over with.
[pointing] Um... [camera reveals that 'RYAN' is crossed out on the 'Welcome Back RYAN banner'; 'A**HOLE' is now written in. Kelly is sitting next to the banner]
Good night Andy.
Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
At least he is in the building.
Great.
Probably went to his head.
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Well?
[rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat.
They're a descriptive people.
Creed?
Hey, we're going with the chairs.
Hey, nice office.
What?
What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night? [laughs]
Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?
Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
To be Edwardian.  His best work.
I don't know what the categories are of workers on a boat.
I think there���s, like, $7 left.
State senator.
What are you implying?
Wow.  This is so much better than the story you made up.
My nephew does it every year. Anything you could give would be fantastic.
You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin]
You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
[noticing a portrait of Angela on the wall] That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
I'll take the tea pot.
Oh. Did - did you see that?
[chuckles]
Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
What is it?
If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
Dunder Mifflin.
Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
Phyllis, Phyllis.
Terrific.
Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
That's what he says?'
I'm gay!
Wow.
So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
Michael. Reading.
No!
So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
From you. I���m sure it���s probably nothing. But what���s with the yoga already?
Yeah, it surprised us all.  I'll tell you why.  Because when they---
[whispers to Kevin] Subtle.
Merry Christmas to you.
Good.
[chuckling] Isn't it a seven-hour drive?
Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
User error. I���ve heard of that happening to other people.
I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
Oh my. That is small.
Alright. Alright I get it.
Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds. [points to his head]
No!
These wings are all fat and bone.
You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
You did it, Kevin.
No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
You put a note in my food?
Yeah.
What part Native American?
Well...
Yeah, brosef.
[to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?
[Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
I think many people find that character slightly racist.
Okay, good, okay.  What bank?
What are we, five?
That reeks, and I'm trying to eat.
Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out]
I brought you a cookie.
You okay? You okay, Stanley?
Well this is what happened: uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice: once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as 'misleading the shareholders.' Another good term is 'fraud.' The real crime, I think, was the beard.
These questions are bush league.
Meredith, your boob is out.
Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
How?  He can't hit back.
I know!
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
Shh!
You're a saint, Pam.
[raises wine bottle] To the kitchen!
Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I���m having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she���s cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it���s business as usual.
Kevin, c'mon.
Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
What?!
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
I have no idea.
The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]
Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
You're gonna get us a copier then?
Have you been to the beach yet?
Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
People, it���s 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
I jus... I just need a signature.
Andy, something is wrong with that woman.
Yeah, but Jim, Dwight���s a weirdo. We can���t blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
Michael, why?
[to nail manager] Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
I���m so sorry. Angela--
Twelve hundred dollars.  What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
Okay. [walks away]
Kevin.
Can you believe this?
Do you have specifics?
sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
He's not even good at his first one.
It's a problem with the client.  I think, Jim...
At least.
Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
I'm done!
I can't believe this is really happening.
Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
It's not that kind of ladle.
my dog Gerald is my life.
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
I'm on the phone.
Go ahead.
Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
What the hell is going on here?
Why do you say that?
So happy. Yeah.
Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
Okay, you need to focus, Michael.  You need to stop spending money.
It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play 'moo'?
Come on, we'll all go.
You know what? I will take Comstock.
I'm in.
he's a historian.
Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
Can you breathe okay?
Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
I always come in at 7.
Oh. [fixes his dress]
Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.
Yep, here they are.
Okay.
Okay Pam.
It could be snacks, or-
[stares at Andy incredulously]
Ummm...
We'll miss you.
Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
Kevin!
She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
Yeah.
What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
No, guys.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.
Do you know how to do an intervention?
How many bottles? Three hundred?
Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.
Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
I would rather not.
So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
[laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
Are you guys listening to this?
Again? We do that every year.
Our office has an unusually large number of��� unusually large people.
Is that a volunteer program or���
Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
What is this?
But I banked six weeks.
Why are we doing this?
Turns out that Creed is a pretty interesting guy.
You could all be doing this, just saying.
I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
[grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
Okay, this is much worse than before.
Senator Lipton, nice to see you.
Michael, I don't know what to say.
What's up, Pam?
Why don't you just ask him--
He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
Yeah.  [Oscar gets up and walks out]
I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh]
Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Yes!
That's print.
Pam.
Hmph.
[bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
Are you kidding me?
I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
Good night, Kevin.
No.
Michael...
C���est la vie.
I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
That's no accident.
[Dwight enters dressed as Recyclops] Not again.
[whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- ��questions.
One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath]
Oh.
Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
Ok.
Per mile.
Are you? [leaves]
You invited someone?
Hey.
Why would we take the dog?
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Yeah, yeah.
I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
He messed yours up to.
I don't think so.
[laughs] Yes. [air high five]
It's gonna hurt.
I don't know how to make that.
Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
How does that even compare?
It's not that funny.
OK.
Well, it's-
Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
I have a question.
So happy hour.
We knew. Ryan told us.
Yes, yes, yes!
Well...
Dumpster Man.
Is there a front runner?
Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying.
You got a bonus check?
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.'
The numbers are correct, Michael.
Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
What?!
It's her first try.
Oh, he's plenty strong.
Pair of shoes!
Again, that gives us no information.
Yeah?
But you just!
Angela, I���ll go with you.
We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
Aah!
You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
It's, it's a completely different name!
Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
Sure. [puts in the twenty]
I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
This is nuts.
Yes, I'm in accounting and I'm sorry and all the extra days. I know I passed my limit.
Don't.
No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
Jim, I think I'm in your way. [leans back - they both exit]
Signed what?
Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
Ok...
Are you going to tell Michael?
He���s making a statement. It���s an ironic comment on our expectations of him.  A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
Here, use my pen.
What bathhouse?
Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Flip it back please.
OK.
Ow! You hit people with that thing?
[to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute?
[in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds-
We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]
I knew that, I knew it.
Irony is such a critical...
Ok...
Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
Role call.
That's really not our job.
Here you go, Creed.
I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
Towards me. That's good, towards me. Towards me. Towards me, towards me. Okay, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.
Where did you get this?
Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
[Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela.
Knock, knock. Oh!
Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
Oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
We can stay a little longer.
It's going to be okay.
I was in the middle of something.
So she's really going to be fine?
They caught us kissing on Halloween.
This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
Towards me.
I don't think so.
He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
What's going on?
No.
Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
Erin-
I'm sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
[tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks.  We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
Pam, I'm sorry--
Yeah, now it doesn't make any sense.
More or less.
...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long.  But it's good.
I guess I'll take the last gift. Cool.
How?
Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
All right.
Andy. That is her private property.
Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
Are you attracted to other men?
I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
Yes, I'm gay.
What--- What are you winking for?
Michael, if I gave you...
Okay, but look, you could have hit 'mood'. Would have played a...
Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
Huh?
[Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Michael?
Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, 'However many dollars per mile.'
This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.
Where are you getting this information?
All right.
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
Great.
No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
[Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body]  What are you doing?!
Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money]
Michael.
Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
It���s insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
What? No!
I know.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
Hey, Dwight.
Good God!
Pam, really? Come on.
Meredith, don't.
it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
I hate to ask you this, but are there any retirement funds you can borrow from?
This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Como estas, senor?
Dunder Mifflin paper.
[on phone] Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
Ah! My hand!  That's hot!
I can help out, if you need me.
There's a lot of anxiety. I don't want to get laid off. This place is like five minutes from my house.
He'll call.
Dwight has a sister?
I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
That���s enough Kevin.
That's a big ethical area?
I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
Come on Toby.
[while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
[whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
Thank you.
What?
Hey, look who���s back, Dwight Junior.
Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.
What's the joke?
You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
[reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!
Just take her name off of everything.
Funny Jim. That is funny.
We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Oh, you think it's a choice?
No, that's a flush.
���Three PM Girl���
[picks up and reads memo] 'Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today.' This is really cool.
Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
State Senator.
All right, Meredith.
Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
I���ll come by after work and pick him up.
Not occasionally. All the time.
What about February 2nd?
That���s enough!
Well?
Oh.
[holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
I'll make it. What are you drinking.
Ah...
Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
You know I don't like to participate in the...
Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty.
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
I'm not done yet.
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
Chicken marsala.
Where do you guys think we're going?
I mean, you've got, you've got stuff here. You rented 'Mermaids.' You can't... It's a movie. You can't deduct that, you know that.
It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
Great, they stole my laptop.
A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that 'q' right there.
Those guys always change back, Angela.
Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
No.
He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
It's never gonna happen.
Toby, how do you propose that we-
I���m just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
Seriously, do you like my idea?  Corn burgers.
Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying]
Ah, I'll just... wait for him.
What town do Holly's parents live in?
Sure.
So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
I am livid, Absolutely livid.
Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
Michael, are you having money problems?
This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
Hey. Matt, right?
That was you, Kevin.
Oh, who needs a house that size?
Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
Honestly, the book is so much better than this.
Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
You���ve heard about it?
Nice to meet you. [shakes Marie's hand]
And get you the hell outta that place.
You have got to be kidding me! No shower?!
Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Stanley.
You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
There you go.
You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
Angela.
She's stuck on that one thing.
I'll take the ... teapot.
You're waterboarding me!
[sees wine collection] Holy cow!
The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
Mm-mm. It's 4:10, I don't think he's gonna show.
Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black]
Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith.
Yes, he's innocent.
We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
Why would you throw something wet at me?
So how was your date?
Thank you David.
Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
What are you guys talkin' about?
You heard me correctly.
Angela, someone wants you.
It starts on it's own. Let it -
[looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
You did what?
We don���t get it.
No, I just like tea.
Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent. [Angela rolls eyes]
Angela, you're more chipper than usual.
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
Skin cancer is treatable.
[whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
Or moon.
That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]
Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
Thank you.
That's her private property.
Okay.
Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
I promised I wouldn't tell.
It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
You're kidding. What was your DJ name?
Mexican isn't offensive.
Yes.
Pam's first celebrity crush.
Oh, yeah. Here's the rest of them.
I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight?
What are you doing?
There is no story.
You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to ���I'd rather be snowboarding��� bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures.
You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
I saw it.
How old is she?
[On phone] No six after the eight, no....
That's the original.
Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
What's number one?
Whoa! Whoa! Dwight! [group reacts]
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
And that got through, so maybe he's thinking he can do that from now on.
We'll see.
The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
No. [shakes head back and forth]
Hi.
[nodding] I did. Yes.
[as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn���t go there. [Kevin shushes him]
So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again- [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note]
I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
I was raised Catholic, but I'm agnostic now, so I guess I'm a secular humanist.
Michael, can I talk to you?
Andy. [alert sounds]
It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
[whispers] Andy brought one too.
Hey guys.  I���m an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying ���Representative Weiner] weiner.
Ok. I got one.
But your mouth is ble���
They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
That's not.
Good job Andy.
You like music at least?
They
I don't think so.
[Jim popping Michael's bubble wrap cast] You should put butter on it.
Yeah.
That's gotta be tough.
You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
El telefono.
Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
Actually, it's just-
I'll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]
What?
Ooh.
Alright.
I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
[confused, whispers] What?
And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um...  What are you microwaving!?
Thank you.
[reading from a note on the microwave] 'To whoever made the microwave mess: the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance.  By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter.  Sincerely, disappointed.'
Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
Oh, Angela.
Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
You���ve gotta be kidding me.
Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
No horseplay.
Uh, nice party Michael.
If you want her to leave, just tip her.
What's that supposed to mean?
Who is this guy again?
He's on one of his honeymoons.
Oh, my goodness.
What?
A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
Really?
Not at all.
Oh, I���m sure ...that���s nothing.
It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey...
Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
What does that mean?
I'll check us in.
[everyone talking to the camera] Just--
Bye.
They're our largest client.
Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?
What?
Why don't you just have an apple?
Jan is smart.
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
What do you see in her?  Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
Yes, yes, absolutely.
[in video] That's supposed to be confidential.
I have a very strong suspicion.
You���re back?
Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela���s husband spoon me back to bed.
You are busy! We're in a meeting!
Yes!
Yes, they can.
[to cleaning people] Good evening, we locked ourselves in. [women don't respond] Nosotros trabajamos aqui, nos trancamos, OK?
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
Hey.
Michael, Michael I... [blinds rustle] ... inside.
How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
Jim what are you doing?
What's going on, Michael?
Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
Can someone please help me?
Wait! [looking at the hardwood floor beneath the carpet] It���s beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
I think it should be Darryl.
Hi, buddy.
Yes, it is.
You���re right.  There should be a monument to this.
Yes I'm super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
Angela!
It���s the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I���m gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I���ll just go downstairs.
Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
He literally won't come out of his office.
You haven't had sex?
Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
Dwight ��� this is one of the archivists here.  I thought maybe we could consult him.
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
See you there.
Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Sure thing Pam, can't wait.
