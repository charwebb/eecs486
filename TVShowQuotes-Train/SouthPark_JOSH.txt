And we certainly don't want to pressure you.
Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house.
That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!
Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah... 
What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?
No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation.
We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!
Well, best to do it and get it out of the way.
Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool hiyouse?
Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?
Ooo, Polceman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Polceman Brown? 
No, but it was worth a try, wasn't it?  Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?
That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual.
I know! Have you ever considered going in on a time share?
Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?
Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm.
And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?
Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?
Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man.
The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it.
Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes.
I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell.
Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah.
Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art.
Lisa I had a really great time tonight.
Try it. Try saying it. "I've got a little place in Aspen."
Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?
Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them.  Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is.
"What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?"
Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah.
Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something I've been meaning to do for quite some time. Ciao. 
Would you... mind very much if kissed you?
