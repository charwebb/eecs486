What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?

Sit! 

Well, best to do it and get it out of the way.

Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?

Why does one toilet-paper houses

It's downright smart!

The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it.

"What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?"

Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!

Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something I've been meaning to do for quite some time. Ciao. 

And we certainly don't want to pressure you.

Try it. Try saying it. "I've got a little place in Aspen."

Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah... 

Nice to meet you, "Mom and Dad." 

Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?

Mm-my  daughter has elephantitis 

And then share it with the people who come tomorrow.

Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?

No, but it was worth a try, wasn't it?  Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?

Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house.

Wow!

Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm.

Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes.

Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah.

They got the red sticker?!

No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation.

I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell.

Would you... mind very much if kissed you?

Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make.  Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy.

Hello Officer Barbrady.

That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!

Oh, hey Randy. What happened to you??

Ooo, Polceman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Polceman Brown? 

Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool hiyouse?

Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art.

And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?

Oh that really stings.

It's nice to feel rich, isn't it.

We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!

You folks enjoying the condo?

Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man.

That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!

Lisa I had a really great time tonight.

Share,  time.  Time share.

Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?

That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual.

Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.

I know! Have you ever considered going in on a time share?

Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah.

No, sir.
