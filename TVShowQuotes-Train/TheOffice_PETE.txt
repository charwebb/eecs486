You know what? Never too married for a noogie.
Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.
The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background]
Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--
And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.
I didn���t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.'
It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
Oh, check it out. This is our first real ���Like.���
I'm just calling it like I see it.
I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.
Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man.
Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?
That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?
Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.
Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.
Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]
Hey, hey, hey, it���s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That���s what this tower���s all about -- ��mistakes. Okay, if you���re afraid of screwing up, the tower���s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That���s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let���s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?
Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It���s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them.
Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--'
I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
Well, I���m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.
Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ���Like��� Derek���s ���Likes.���
Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.
I do think we can have a fair....
Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved.
There we go. All right, let���s do it.
It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.
Why don't you say in the beginning: ���This isn't really going that well���
Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So��� thanks PBS.
[doing a series of hand bumps with Erin] Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?
The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.
It���s cool, man. I���m sure you and I will have our own thing.
[whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they���re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information���s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to ���chillax,��� and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don���t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. ��Fight the power.
Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.
Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?
Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ���sausage factory.���
That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] 'After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--'
It was college. That is what you do.
It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied.
Okay, call down. It���s just me, not Tom Selleck.
That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
Or we can just sit and talk, though.
My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk.
Well, I���ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
[to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? You���re like the new office administrator.
Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific.
See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
Ah, I like the Red Sox. I���m from Vermont.
