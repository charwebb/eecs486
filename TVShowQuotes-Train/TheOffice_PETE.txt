Smoking.
Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So��� thanks PBS.
Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
That���s the idea.
No, that's the--
What���s the opposite of a horse?
Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
A little mo' cardio.
No!
Hey. You got a sec to talk?
Oh���okay. Sorry.
You don't like flying, do you?'
Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
What?
Fine.
Yeah.
I don���t want it, really.
Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera.
Yeah.
Well, okay, then.
Okay, call down. It���s just me, not Tom Selleck.
I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background]
Yeah.
Well, I���m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.
Ok.
Sure, boxing, tennis.
Alice. Oh man.
Awesome. Have fun.
What?
[referring to the letter] It���s open.
Yeah, he is.
Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.
All right, all right.Okay, start over.
Cool. He's like 40 though, right?
Common mistake.
I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
Did she buy it?
Why don't you say in the beginning: ���This isn't really going that well���
Andy?
I'm just calling it like I see it.
Andy, that is really inappropriate.
I'm trying..
I'll get my coat.
I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It���s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
Andy.
Douche.
Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] 'After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--'
Well, I���ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun!
Ok.
Really? I got something?
Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?
What? Why?
Yeah, come on, Tobes.
Why haven't you seen die hard?
Oh, that's okay, bud.
Relax.
See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
Erin! Erin! Just stop.
Alright? I'll be in the annex.
Hey. She's back.
That, is awesome!
Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--'
Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.
This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ���sausage factory.���
Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
I do think we can have a fair....
I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved.
[slightly surprised] Sure.
It is so unpleasant. You?
Well. Is it?
Hey, did Erin already take off?
Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--
No I���m not.
There he is!
[putting mayo on Erin's head] How's that?
Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
Okay.
Kevin, I can hear you.
It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
Erin, did this call...
Yeah. [Erin kicks box] Whoa!
Pete!
What?
yeah. That���s-- that is terrible.
Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex.
Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.
All right.
That���s really nice.
Can you hand me a card?
The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
yeah.
NASCAR. The Amazing Race.
That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ���Like��� Derek���s ���Likes.���
[whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey, it���s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That���s what this tower���s all about -- ��mistakes. Okay, if you���re afraid of screwing up, the tower���s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That���s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let���s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?
No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them.
Yeah, no problem. How was it?
I didn���t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk.
All right. Check it out.
You can't fire-
Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
It���s cool, man. I���m sure you and I will have our own thing.
Die hard reference.
Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
Yeah. [long pause] You were gone.
And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.
Oh.
If you want to talk to me
A horse.
No.
Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.
Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?
Hear what?
Uh, is it Duncan?
Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
Fonas chek!
Poor Angela.
Oh sorry! Sorry.
It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.
Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
Hey.
All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
Toby?
Hey Erin!
It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
Hey.
Okay.
I was just leaving.
Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!
Uh-huh.
[to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? You���re like the new office administrator.
Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
I don't think that's Nelly.
Oh, yeah, of course. I know.
Andy.
Seems unnecessary for an audition.
My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
Toby!
What?
Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.
Wow.
Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied.
One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they���re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information���s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to ���chillax,��� and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don���t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. ��Fight the power.
Oh, I���m sorry. It���s for the thing.
Okay.
Oh, no, no, no. No it���s cool.
Yeah.
Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
Yeah.
Yeah. We uh, have a history.
For insulting a client���s recently deceased mother.
Or we can just sit and talk, though.
[doing a series of hand bumps with Erin] Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?
Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera]
No, it actually  feels kinda nice.
[sarcastically] Yay, another person yelling at me.
Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]
Hey. Everything okay?
Oh my god.
No thank you. My name���s Pete.
There we go. All right, let���s do it.
The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.
What?
Will do.
Yes.
Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man.
Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?
Your husband?
Nice to see you again, Pam.
Ah, I like the Red Sox. I���m from Vermont.
It was college. That is what you do.
Yeah, a little bit.
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.'
See ya later, Heymont.
[whispering] OK.
Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
I've got the seat adjusted right.
Fax?
I think this is better.
Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
You haven't seen die hard?
