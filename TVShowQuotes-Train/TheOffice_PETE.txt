Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?
Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] 'After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--'
Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
[whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
[doing a series of hand bumps with Erin] Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?
Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It���s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera.
Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
I didn���t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
I do think we can have a fair....
Hey, hey, hey, it���s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That���s what this tower���s all about -- ��mistakes. Okay, if you���re afraid of screwing up, the tower���s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That���s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let���s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?
See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.
Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex.
Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ���Like��� Derek���s ���Likes.���
It was college. That is what you do.
Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied.
There we go. All right, let���s do it.
That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk.
Ah, I like the Red Sox. I���m from Vermont.
Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]
It���s cool, man. I���m sure you and I will have our own thing.
Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--'
It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.
Oh, check it out. This is our first real ���Like.���
Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.
Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So��� thanks PBS.
That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
Okay, call down. It���s just me, not Tom Selleck.
Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?
Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--
Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.
Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
[to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? You���re like the new office administrator.
Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.
Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific.
The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.
Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.
One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they���re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information���s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to ���chillax,��� and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don���t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. ��Fight the power.
Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.'
My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?
Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera]
Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
Well, I���ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
Well, I���m still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.
I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
Why don't you say in the beginning: ���This isn't really going that well���
I'm just calling it like I see it.
Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ���sausage factory.���
You know what? Never too married for a noogie.
The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background]
Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]
