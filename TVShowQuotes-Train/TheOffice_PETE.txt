[sound effect of throwing ball]
Yeah. [Erin kicks box] Whoa!
Andy?
Yeah, a little bit.
Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex.
I'm trying..
Ok.
Fax?
Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.
Okay.
Toby!
Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
I'll get my coat.
yeah.
You mean horses?
Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
Uh, is it Duncan?
Hey.
Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]
Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
Hey Erin!
[whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
Yeah.
All right.
This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun!
[doing a series of hand bumps with Erin] Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?
Ah, I like the Red Sox. I���m from Vermont.
The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--'
Relax.
Did she buy it?
Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!
What? Why?
No, that's the--
Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera]
That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?
It is so unpleasant. You?
No.
That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
Okay.
Why haven't you seen die hard?
NASCAR. The Amazing Race.
Andy.
Hey, did Erin already take off?
Yes.
yeah. That���s-- that is terrible.
There we go.
Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?
Plop? Still?
All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
Oh, check it out. This is our first real ���Like.���
Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?
For insulting a client���s recently deceased mother.
Alice. Oh man.
[whispering] OK.
Fine.
[referring to the letter] It���s open.
You know what? Never too married for a noogie.
Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man.
And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.
I was just leaving.
It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
It was college. That is what you do.
Yeah.
Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ���Like��� Derek���s ���Likes.���
There we go. All right, let���s do it.
Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.
Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]
Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
I'm just calling it like I see it.
A horse.
Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
Okay, call down. It���s just me, not Tom Selleck.
One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they���re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information���s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to ���chillax,��� and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don���t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. ��Fight the power.
Hey. You got a sec to talk?
Hey, you OK?
Hey, just having fun Jimmy.
Andy.
Seems unnecessary for an audition.
Cool. He's like 40 though, right?
I don't think that's Nelly.
Common mistake.
Yeah, whatever you say, boss.
You can't fire-
You don't like flying, do you?'
That Clark, huh? Errr [punches palm] Ca!
Yeah, come on, Tobes.
If you want to talk to me
Oh, yeah, of course. I know.
Well, I���ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.
Can you hand me a card?
[slightly surprised] Sure.
Hear what?
What?
Ok.
Erin! Erin! Just stop.
I think this is better.
Oh sorry! Sorry.
No I���m not.
Yeah, no problem. How was it?
Well, okay, then.
What?
Hey. She's back.
I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
What?
Awesome. Have fun.
Oh, that's okay, bud.
Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera.
See ya later, Heymont.
Okay.
Die hard reference.
Your husband?
I'll be in the annex.
That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?
Why are you getting rid of it?
Yeah. [long pause] You were gone.
All right, all right.Okay, start over.
What���s the opposite of a horse?
That���s the idea.
Yeah.
Oh���okay. Sorry.
Douche.
Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.
There you go.
She's nice to me.
Oh.
The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.
I don���t want it, really.
Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.
Nice to see you again, Pam.
Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved.
Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific.
Wow.
Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.
Toby?
Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--
Uh-huh.
Poor Angela.
There he is!
[sarcastically] Yay, another person yelling at me.
Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
Why don't you say in the beginning: ���This isn't really going that well���
Oh my god.
See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
Andy, that is really inappropriate.
Yeah.
It���s cool, man. I���m sure you and I will have our own thing.
Hey.
I've got the seat adjusted right.
I didn���t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them.
No, it actually  feels kinda nice.
Well. Is it?
You haven't seen die hard?
Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
No!
Hey, hey, hey, it���s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That���s what this tower���s all about -- ��mistakes. Okay, if you���re afraid of screwing up, the tower���s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That���s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let���s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?
Hey. Everything okay?
Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied.
Hey, look who it is!
Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
Really? I got something?
Smoking.
For a long time, Andy.
I do think we can have a fair....
That���s really nice.
Erin, did this call...
Fonas chek!
Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] 'After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--'
Alright? I'll be in the annex.
Or we can just sit and talk, though.
Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So��� thanks PBS.
Oh, I���m sorry. It���s for the thing.
Yeah. We uh, have a history.
It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
A little mo' cardio.
This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ���sausage factory.���
Yeah.
Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It���s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
