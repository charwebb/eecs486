Well, okay, then.
You mean horses?
Toby!
Andy.
Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
That���s the idea.
Okay, call down. It���s just me, not Tom Selleck.
Plop? Still?
Fonas chek!
Cool. He's like 40 though, right?
Erin, did this call...
Alice. Oh man.
It���s cool, man. I���m sure you and I will have our own thing.
Uh, is it Duncan?
Yeah, come on, Tobes.
Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
Relax.
Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
yeah. That���s-- that is terrible.
Sure, boxing, tennis.
Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--
What?
Oh my god.
Well, I���ve gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
What?
Okay.
Hey. You got a sec to talk?
Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.
Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.
Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man.
Oh sorry! Sorry.
It is so unpleasant. You?
Hey, look who it is!
Well. Is it?
Ah, I like the Red Sox. I���m from Vermont.
Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?
Okay.
There he is!
That���s really nice.
You can't fire-
Nice to see you again, Pam.
[referring to the letter] It���s open.
I'll be in the annex.
Ok.
I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
Alright? I'll be in the annex.
Andy?
Die hard reference.
Your husband?
Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
What?
Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.
Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
A little mo' cardio.
Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
Yeah, no problem. How was it?
Oh���okay. Sorry.
Douche.
Andy, that is really inappropriate.
Andy.
Hey. She's back.
Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--'
No, that's the--
Yeah. [long pause] You were gone.
You haven't seen die hard?
Smoking.
The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ���sausage factory.���
There you go.
Oh yeah.
Toby?
That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!
You don't like flying, do you?'
A horse.
What?
Hey, you OK?
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, it���s just a mistake. Just a mistake. That���s what this tower���s all about -- ��mistakes. Okay, if you���re afraid of screwing up, the tower���s not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That���s right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let���s get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?
It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.
I didn���t realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
Yeah. We uh, have a history.
yeah.
Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete]
Yeah.
One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they���re in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information���s already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to ���chillax,��� and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don���t give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. ��Fight the power.
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.'
Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
[whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
Hey, just having fun Jimmy.
Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?
Can you hand me a card?
Uh-huh.
Hey, did Erin already take off?
Hey.
Seems unnecessary for an audition.
[putting mayo on Erin's head] How's that?
Oh, check it out. This is our first real ���Like.���
Why are you getting rid of it?
Common mistake.
No I���m not.
Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] 'After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--'
Hear what?
Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera.
Poor Angela.
I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background]
All right.
Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team.
I don���t want it, really.
I was just leaving.
And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.
See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
I've got the seat adjusted right.
Yeah, a little bit.
Pete!
That Clark, huh? Errr [punches palm] Ca!
See ya later, Heymont.
Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk.
Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific.
Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them ���Like��� Derek���s ���Likes.���
[to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? You���re like the new office administrator.
Did she buy it?
It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
All right, all right.Okay, start over.
Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So��� thanks PBS.
Kevin, I can hear you.
Hey. Everything okay?
Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
No, it actually  feels kinda nice.
Will do.
Oh, I���m sorry. It���s for the thing.
Ok.
Okay.
Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera]
What? Why?
Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]
Wow.
[whispering] OK.
[slightly surprised] Sure.
Fax?
Yeah, he is.
I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
I'm trying..
Yeah. [Erin kicks box] Whoa!
No thank you. My name���s Pete.
Really? I got something?
Erin! Erin! Just stop.
All right. Check it out.
There we go.
There we go. All right, let���s do it.
What?
Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.
Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied.
Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
No!
Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It���s a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
I think this is better.
She's nice to me.
[sarcastically] Yay, another person yelling at me.
[sound effect of throwing ball]
I'm just calling it like I see it.
Yeah.
The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone.
Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex.
No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them.
Fine.
Oh, yeah, of course. I know.
Hey Erin!
Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
Oh, that's okay, bud.
Yes.
NASCAR. The Amazing Race.
Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved.
Why don't you say in the beginning: ���This isn't really going that well���
That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
That, is awesome!
Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?
No.
Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.
My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
Or we can just sit and talk, though.
Yeah.
