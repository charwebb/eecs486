He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.
Is this the boy who's been living in our realm?
I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.
Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw.  Go on, try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull my thorm!  Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho! 
Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!
It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.
Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!
So, you want to live with the lions, do you?
Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel! 
The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!
It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?
Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!
Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes.
You have a power here that you have yet to understand.
Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
And what makes you think you can fit it with us?
Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!
We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!
Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.
We prepare for a battle we cannot win.  Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon,  must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number,  but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy.  Only you can help us win this battle.
Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.
Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!
