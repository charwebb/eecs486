He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.
Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!
Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.
It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?
We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!
Imaginationland... used to be a happy place. But then the terrorists attacked.  And so many of us were killed.  The Barrier came down, and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed.  Now our final battle will take place. The evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out. 
Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel! 
There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!
Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw.  Go on, try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull my thorm!  Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho! 
Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!
Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes.
So, you want to live with the lions, do you?
It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.
Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!
I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.
The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!
Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
You have a power here that you have yet to understand.
Is this the boy who's been living in our realm?
Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.
Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!
Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!
