How much longer must we wait for our superhighway??
Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth!  What the?  Wait a minute.  Stop! Stop!  Your, your SARS. Where did it go?
My son... Premise Running Thin has the SARS as well.  You... you can cure him?
Yeessss. It is time for us to implement our plan.  A superhighway, built from Denver right to our casino!
Simple. We buy it, and we demolish it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
Halt.  I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor.
No! I told you not to touch them!
You have cured Premise Running Thin. In return, I shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino.  All right, all right, I will not build a superhighway through your town. And you can all have your homes back.
I already have a plan how we can force them off our land... sneakily.  We're going to give them...  blankets. 
You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club.
Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land.
Dammit! I thought you said they were dealt with!
Yes. We will present the blankets as a peace offering. But what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with SARS.  They will all get SARS! And then SARS will run through their town like a buffalo. Now I need your help getting the SARS onto the blankets.  Okay, bring them in!  Let's see how South Park deals with this!  Everyone grab a Chinese person and rub them on a blanket.  Make sure you rub them all over. Get the SARS nice and deep in there. 
Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away!
We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits.
This would never have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe!
The residents of South Park had hoped to raise three hundred thousand dollars. but in the end managed to raise only ten. The loss of their town may be imminent for the poor people of South Park.  Awww, I think I'm going to cuwhy.
