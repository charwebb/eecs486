You know, you are just as dumb at night.
That's messed up.
Honey, I am not sleeping with-
Thanks for the coffee.
Hey.
Are you really this lazy?
Can I help you?
All right guys, clear out.
Cashmere.
You in?
Okay.

Yeah, sure.
Promise me that-
Brandon!
You're wearing the beanie. You like it?
Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim?
You're not. I believe in us.
[comes up from under water] How was that?
Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out.
[stands next to him] Right here?
As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.
It has been delivered.
The Doc crew���s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
No, I'm good. Thank you.
Thanks, they're from my mom.
Yup, yup.
Yeah.
Yeah. Thanks.
Not bad fellas, you're better than you look.
Yeaha���yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in.
It's how it has to be.
That's what I'm sayin'.
Can't wait.
Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
Yeah, that's true.
Promise me you're going to clean up.
Calm down, he's not.
Uh, Brandon?
Alright.
Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy.
That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab.
Oh I've got him!
Great. It was really fun.
I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
What should I wear?
Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?
Don't quit. [Darryl eavesdropping, nods]
I caught it.
Me neither. Come here. [she hugs Darryl, and Darryl smiles behind her back]
Come on.
I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?
Hey, Darryl.
I think the music left without you.
Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Since when does a sweater mean ���dressed up���? Am I your grandson?
OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.
Thank you.
Yeah, that's her.
Wow. Those are really nice.
Okay, thanks.
Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?
Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
OK.
