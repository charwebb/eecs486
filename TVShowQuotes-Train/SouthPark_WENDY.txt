Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening! 
Well, not if it's Cartman.  Hey, where are you all going!  They don't even know what Walden is.  I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.
It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.
Which one? We make lists all the time.
I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.
My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.
So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! 
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.
That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! 
Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.
"I think you look cute in your bunny costume." What is that supposed to mean?!
Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher.
Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.
So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!
You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you
Stan, can I talk to you for a second?  Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?
Hello?  My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."
I heard that her asshole is this big around. 
...And I was like, "I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars." 
Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
Oh. Hi, Stan.  I think it worked, Bebe.
You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?
That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe.
Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?
No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends.
As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.
All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.
East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. 
If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace.
You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!  Bye, Ms. Ellen.
Why?!  Why are you doing this to me?!  Why won't you just stop?!
I'm not "jel", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!
Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?
If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
Yeah, I heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points.
It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.
Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.
So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!
Dad, there's a new store at the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!
And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.
I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 
Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.
Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  "dripping in bitches"?!
Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.
She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!
...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  I'm asking you a question! 
Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.
It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!
I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school.
But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! 
When someone gets as old as you,  do they have to wear Depends undergarments? 
This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! 
The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!
Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.
No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. 
You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?
Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. 
You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.
No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!
I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.
Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick
When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch.
Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
I know. Let's do "Light as a feather, stiff as a board."  Who wants to do it first?
We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!
You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?
No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.
Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.
Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.
''Miiis-suuus Landers was a health nut; She cooked food in a wok
Mr. Harris was her boyfriend, and he had a great big-
Cock-a-doodle-doodle, the rooster just won't quit
And I don't want my breakfast, because it tastes like-

Dictate what I'm saying, 'cause it will bring you luck
And if you all don't like it, I don't give a flying fuck!
I'm totally back to normal. See you later. 
Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
Stan? We need to talk about your locker.
Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.
If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue  It's fun.
Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.  Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross! 
I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!
Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?
The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.
Nono, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.
But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
Something that should have been done a long time ago! 
Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-
Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.
How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
Maybe we should go on a cruise or something. 
I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger! 
I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!
I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-
You can't bribe your way out of this!
No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!
Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.
I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?
No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! 
So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?
Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
Yeah.  And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders.  The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nicole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair.  And Heidi Turner's butt is flat!  Oh God damn it!
Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.
No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.
AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. 
Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?
This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.
Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-
I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.
Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad.
I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.
That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. 
I don't, I, I have no idea what-
Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please?  Mr. Garrison?!
Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-
Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides . We select the eyes , make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin , lengthen the neck , add more to the hair , select the lips and make them fuller , take out any puffiness on the skin  here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin , streamline the shoulders , put highlights in the eyes , and, there.
Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it.
I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!
Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? 
Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. 
Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list. 
You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?
I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.
Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.
After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!
How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?
Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.
"I think you look cute in your bunny costume."
Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 
I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.
I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!
That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!
But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-
This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-
Look it up, stupid!  In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit!  You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! 
Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.
But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it.
It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing.
What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to "In a relationship"!
See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far!  And if society won't fix it, I will!
Wait, wait!  It's time to whip out the eclipse shoebox thing!  Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen.
I'm class president! The vote was last fall!
Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?
...Helen! 
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! 
You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams".
Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?
Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!
You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!
If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate.
Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.
Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 
No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.
Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.
Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's just not something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!
Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams.
Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the… the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-  ah…  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...
Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.
This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?
Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?
No, it's okay, Stan!  Everything's going to be o-kay!
Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!
This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!
I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.
Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films.
I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!
Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?
Hey Jessie , hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange.
Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-
Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the- 
Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!
Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. 
Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!
It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.
Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover.
Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. 
I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca. 
So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! 
There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.
That's fine!  People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!
Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-
If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!  He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now.
But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?
What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there.
Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack. 
I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? 
You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.
You really think that's gonna work on me?!
It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.
Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.
That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. 
Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut.
Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?
Oh God, please don't let this be happening.
Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?
I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.
I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this. 
I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise. 
Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the visitors are using him as part of their plan. Maybe you should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.
...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.
When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-
Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.
That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. 
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! 
He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.
You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends!
Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.  I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.
Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. 
Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.
