Thank God.

Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.

I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.

Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.  Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross! 

I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.

My poor little Helen.

Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! 

She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!

I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school.

Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?

D'aaaaahhh!

Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.

...yeah.

Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? 

Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  "dripping in bitches"?!

Hey guys. 

Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today? 

Wait, wait!  It's time to whip out the eclipse shoebox thing!  Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen.

What?

But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?

Yeah. Thank God.

Mmmm.

I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?

You know I can't fight you!

I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!

Oh wow, I'm shocked.

You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?

Nooo!! Nooo!!

...But what does she do?

You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!

Wendy.

Hi, everybody. 

Don't let anything happen to it, please. 

Let's just get back to cheering, okay?!

Stan, I can't do it alone. Please? 

It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing.

Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.

Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?

Over here. This looks like an office.

Come on, Stan. 

But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!

Ew! 

Oh, you mean Kyle?

...Nooo.

What?

You're not ugly, Marjorine.

I know.

We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!

Hi, Stan.

So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!

Hi guys, what's up?

What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there.

Okay.

Well tell Stan to fuck off!! 

Oh no! NO!

I don't, I, I have no idea what-

You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.

She does. She looks very pretty.

I heard that her asshole is this big around. 

I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca. 

"I think you look cute in your bunny costume." What is that supposed to mean?!

Stan, can I talk to you for a second?  Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?

Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!

Hi, guys.

Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. 

Many would rather die than go to those places!

Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!

Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! 

So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?

It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!

What?

Is what true?

Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-

I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 

I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger! 

I wanna see my egg.

Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.

Dare ga pu shita no. 

Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?

Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.

Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.

You are so pathetic!

You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.

I didn't mean that-

You think you're tough?

...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  I'm asking you a question! 

What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?

Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.

Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?

Hrmph!

No you don't.

I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!

Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day.

But why, Stan?

Hi guys.

You guys, look!  It's snowing! 

Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!

Agh! What do you want?

Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.

''Miiis-suuus Landers was a health nut; She cooked food in a wok
Mr. Harris was her boyfriend, and he had a great big-
Cock-a-doodle-doodle, the rooster just won't quit

Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! 

Nono, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.

You really think that's gonna work on me?!

She can't see or hear us, John.

How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!

No. Not Bebe.

Hey Bebe.

Oh God, please don't let this be happening.

Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-

Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!

Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.

What?

My... parents said that if I fight-

It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus.

That's okay, you guys. 

Wow, that sucks!

I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.

Butters. Butters, come here for a sec.

Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!

No!

What the fuck is your problem?!

Eeewwww! 

Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's just not something we do flippantly! There's protocol!

Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. 

Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! 

Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?

Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!

Which one? We make lists all the time.

Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.

I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? 

Yeah! 

This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?

Yeahhh?

Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!

Kaqemblaq! 

Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?

Can you teach me your secret fast?

Maybe we should go on a cruise or something. 

What's going on?

Ah, what the hell. 

No. No, that's my egg.

How about we give him Bebe?

It's cool. I'll wait.

Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening! 

What are you doing?! 

Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.

So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.

Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?

Yeah, you just never know.

Let's go trick-or-treats.

I will. Kyle?

Hey, he's like Rudolph.

Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!

You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams".

I'm a stupid spoiled whore. 

Eww!

And he's not fat at all.

I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!

Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.

Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?

You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?

AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. 

Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-

What?!

You...you can't.

That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.

Are you wearing a condom?

What?

I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.

Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-

Ugh!

Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!

You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!

No, it's okay, Stan!  Everything's going to be o-kay!

Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!

I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-

No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.

...And I was like, "I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars." 

Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?

We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!

Stan!

Hi, Stan.

He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.

They must be negotiating.

This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.

You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends!

John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick
When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch.

Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please?  Mr. Garrison?!

Hey Stan.

No you aren't!

Yes ma'am!

Aaahh.

He's got a gun!

Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?

Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.

Stan? We need to talk about your locker.

Huh?

Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.

Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.

Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams.

Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

Hey, look. A French fry.

I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.

NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!

I have three thousand dollars, cash. 

Well, not if it's Cartman.  Hey, where are you all going!  They don't even know what Walden is.  I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.

UUuuhh-UUuuhh 

Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.

What day?

If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace.

Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.

Hitler was famous too.

Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut.

That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!

Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack. 

Truth or Dare?

She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!

I'm not going to hurt you.

I can't get a dial tone. 

By editing your profile under "basic information"!

And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,  and I've learned from it.  I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world.

Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. 

Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!

Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.

Thought so. 

But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it.

Oh, hi, Kyle!

Stan? We're still Valentines, right?

And I'm your captain, Wendy! 

1776.

I'm totally back to normal. See you later. 

There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. 

No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.

So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! 

Oh, for Christ's sake!

Yeah.

Say it'll be like this forever.

It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. 

Yes, she was!

Yeah?

I'm class president! The vote was last fall!

Look it up, stupid!  In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit!  You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! 

Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.

Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it.

Slut.

Thanks, Stan.

Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.

I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.

You should have won that talent show.

I want to see my egg.

Hey Jessie , hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange.

Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.

But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?

Of course, Stan. 

WHAT?!

That isn't fair!

Gooood.

"The new Cold War"

Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?

Hey look. 

Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!  He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now.

Why?!  Why are you doing this to me?!  Why won't you just stop?!

Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.

Huh?

This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!

What the hell do you think you're doing?

Leave me alone.

Oh my God!

Where are you going, Stan?

Aaah!

No.  You go ahead.

Wow! Cool!

What??

Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.

No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.

I can't!  God damn it!

Oh God.

I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa.

Oh, coool!

Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?

What?!

Eww.

Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.

I don't have time for this.

Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!

No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. 

If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?

Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?

Sure.

Here, Stan. This is for you. 

That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. 
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! 

Yeah.  And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders.  The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nicole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair.  And Heidi Turner's butt is flat!  Oh God damn it!

Eeewww!

When someone gets as old as you,  do they have to wear Depends undergarments? 

If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!

Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!

Stan, that's ridiculous.

Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.

Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.

You're gonna  fucking die! 

Yes.

Is that a lace across the top?

I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this. 

East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. 

I think we went too far with Marjorine.

Stan? Stan?!

Noooo! Noooo!

No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends.

Eww!

Eww! 

We're gonna miss what?

I don't get it. What's she do?

U-huh. Excuse me.  Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!

She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!

If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate.

Okay.

Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.

This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!

What happened to your little brother?

And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to "In a relationship"!

You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity!

What's happening?

That's fine!  People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!

Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides . We select the eyes , make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin , lengthen the neck , add more to the hair , select the lips and make them fuller , take out any puffiness on the skin  here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin , streamline the shoulders , put highlights in the eyes , and, there.

Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-

Oh, what happened? Stan?

Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover.

I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!

Don't fuck with me!

Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?

Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue  It's fun.

Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. 

That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe.

You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.

There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.

Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!

What? No!

Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?

I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend.

Hi, Stan.

...Helen! 
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!

What's that? 

Go ahead.

Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?

I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?

What?!

It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.

Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-

You guys, we have to stop him!

Unh  Oh!

James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.

You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!  Bye, Ms. Ellen.

What?

GET OUT OF HERE!

Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.

Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?

Whatever, dude.

This is the girls bathroom!

Am I a joke to you?

Yeah?

Well it is!

No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!

Who's Paris Hilton?

I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.

Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning! 

Wow, I knew I would win.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?

We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. 

Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.

When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-

-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.

Yes ma'am!

Sshh!

The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the… the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-  ah…  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...

Oh, no!

You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.  I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.

Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!

Yes sir.

Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!

Yeah, Stan.

Thanks for coming over, Bebe.

Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.

Oh cool!

What are you doing?!

It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.

What?!

God they're so stupid!

Hi everybody. I love you!

You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!

You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.

I believe in Mr. Hankey.

You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.

NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!! 

Kiss Bebe on the lips!

What's the matter, Kyle?

Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.

All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.

That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!

That's okay.

So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! 

Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?

Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.

Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

Aaaah!

No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.

Excuse me!

Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.

I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-

Yeah!

Oh no! Oh no!!! 

The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-

Yeah!

But Mr. Garrison!

I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 

You knew!

I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.

Yeah, I heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points.

You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?

This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!

But Stan!

Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid! 

Hey, he's like Rudolph.

The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!

No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.

Your turn, Bebe.

Wow.  What incredible irony.

Nooo! 

Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.

Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!

Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad.

That's right!

What's going on?

You wanna dance? 

"I think you look cute in your bunny costume."

She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! 

Butters!

I'll smack the shit out of you!

After school! We fight after school! You got that?!

Something that should have been done a long time ago! 

Aaaah!

Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.

Cheer Squad roll call! 

Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.

Is the clubhouse ready?

That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! 

Oh, Cartman! 

I know. Let's do "Light as a feather, stiff as a board."  Who wants to do it first?

...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.

That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian!

Hahaha.  Stan. Stan, wait up! 

Oh my God.

Hey, what are you doing?

I'm not "jel", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!

Happy Valentine's Day, Staan. 

DIE!! 

I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise. 

Yes! I want to get breast implants!

And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.

That's what I said.

My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.

So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!

...Are you serious?

What does she do?!

Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq!

I would never leave you for Bridon.

Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.

Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?

Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the visitors are using him as part of their plan. Maybe you should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.

This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!

Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films.

And why do you think young people-?

See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?

Get away from me! 

No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!

Dad, there's a new store at the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!

Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.

Aha ha.

Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.

Cartman is using our bathroom!

Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. 

Okay

Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the- 

Stan, run!

Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.

He doesn't even know what he wrote about!

Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.

This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-

You're so transparent, Stan.

I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.

Hey, what's that?

Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change.

But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-

Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!

Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-

You don't understand. He said horrible things.

You gave it up?

Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 

You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?

It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.

I'm finished! 

I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-

No!

Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?

Mmmm.

Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.

I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?

It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.

Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. 

Ugh, Jesus! 

If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-

Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.

Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?

AAAAAAAAAAAH!

You mean, I should kiss him? 

Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!

What? What do you mean?

Stay away from me, Stan!

Eww! 

Not lately, no.

Aaahahah!

Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!

HI, STAN!

I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.

Dad!
