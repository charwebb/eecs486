That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
You can't bribe your way out of this!
Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? 
Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. 
Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.
Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.
That's fine!  People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!
You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends!
I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.
But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?
Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.
She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!
Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 
Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.
I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
"I think you look cute in your bunny costume."
Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. 
I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!
Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
Hey Jessie , hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange.
Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.
Look it up, stupid!  In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit!  You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! 
That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! 
And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to "In a relationship"!
No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!
Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! 
I don't, I, I have no idea what-
Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-
Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! 
No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.
No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends.
...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.
But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please?  Mr. Garrison?!
If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate.
Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?
Stan? We need to talk about your locker.
Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!
Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.
Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-
Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.
Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams.
I think we went too far with Marjorine.
Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue  It's fun.
Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!
Oh. Hi, Stan.  I think it worked, Bebe.
This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!
This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.
Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
When someone gets as old as you,  do they have to wear Depends undergarments? 
He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the visitors are using him as part of their plan. Maybe you should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.
I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!
How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
Yeah, I heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points.
Yeah.  And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders.  The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nicole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair.  And Heidi Turner's butt is flat!  Oh God damn it!
I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend.
Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.
Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.
I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca. 
So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?
Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.  Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross! 
Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!
Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list. 
So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?
I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad.
I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!

...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  I'm asking you a question! 
"I think you look cute in your bunny costume." What is that supposed to mean?!
Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening! 
I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger! 
She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! 
Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
Well, not if it's Cartman.  Hey, where are you all going!  They don't even know what Walden is.  I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.
Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.
Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!
I know. Let's do "Light as a feather, stiff as a board."  Who wants to do it first?
Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. 
But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it.
Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.
I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. 
Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.
If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! 
You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?
Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-
What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?
No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.
It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.
Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!
Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.
There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.
I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.
No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. 
I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?
Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?
I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.
Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
Dad, there's a new store at the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!
All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.
So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! 
Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.
Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. 
But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?
I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.
Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.
John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick
When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch.
Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?
Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?
Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.
You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.
You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams".
Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.
I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-
Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.
Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the- 
There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. 
Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you
Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.
I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut.
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! 
Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
Wait, wait!  It's time to whip out the eclipse shoebox thing!  Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen.
Maybe we should go on a cruise or something. 
Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
Many would rather die than go to those places!
You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!
Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-
I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.
And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
I heard that her asshole is this big around. 
James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.
I'm not "jel", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!
He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.
Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it.
I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school.
You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!  Bye, Ms. Ellen.
Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides . We select the eyes , make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin , lengthen the neck , add more to the hair , select the lips and make them fuller , take out any puffiness on the skin  here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin , streamline the shoulders , put highlights in the eyes , and, there.
Hello?  My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."
Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
You really think that's gonna work on me?!
The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!
Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the… the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-  ah…  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...
What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!
I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 
Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?
Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!
AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. 
This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.
Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?
Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.
We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!
No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.
You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. 
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! 
You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?
That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?
Nono, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.
Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!
Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?
That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!
You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?
This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!
No, it's okay, Stan!  Everything's going to be o-kay!
This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.
It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.
Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.
It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.
If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-
Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's just not something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!
Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.
Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace.
Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.
I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.
Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.
You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?
Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?
Stan, can I talk to you for a second?  Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?
I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?
Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!
Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!
Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!
What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there.
No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!
I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 
I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!
And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,  and I've learned from it.  I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world.
...Helen! 
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far!  And if society won't fix it, I will!
Which one? We make lists all the time.
Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.
East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. 
Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  "dripping in bitches"?!
When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-
Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! 
Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!
It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.
You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!  He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now.
I'm totally back to normal. See you later. 
It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!
Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack. 
I'm class president! The vote was last fall!
No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.
Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.  I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.
Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.
It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list.
