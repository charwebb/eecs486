I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise. 

See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far!  And if society won't fix it, I will!

Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-

No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.

Look it up, stupid!  In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit!  You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! 

Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.

Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.

Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. 

Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?

I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.

I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-

Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.

Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-

Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?

I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend.

Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the visitors are using him as part of their plan. Maybe you should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.

I'm not "jel", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!

You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!

But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!

It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. 

Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.

I heard that her asshole is this big around. 

Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.

"I think you look cute in your bunny costume."

...Helen! 
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!

No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. 

John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick
When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch.

I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?

Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!

Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.

She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!

Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!

This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?

I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!

Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  "dripping in bitches"?!

If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate.

I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 

Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?

I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?

You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.

I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-

Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.

Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.

Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films.

This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!

I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!

...And I was like, "I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars." 

Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!

Oh God, please don't let this be happening.

I don't, I, I have no idea what-

Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.

I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!

So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.

Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.

Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue  It's fun.

I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger! 

After school! We fight after school! You got that?!

Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! 

Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!

Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list. 

She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! 

This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!

Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.

I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?

It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.

Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.

All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.

You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.

Yeah, I heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points.

Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?

It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!

How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?

I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.

So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!

Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams.

If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace.

Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! 

Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!

Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?

Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.

No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!

Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.

Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. 

Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!

I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.

Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.

Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?

Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the- 

Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! 

Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.

Yeah.  And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders.  The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nicole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair.  And Heidi Turner's butt is flat!  Oh God damn it!

What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there.

Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?

Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.

Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it.

You really think that's gonna work on me?!

Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.

Stan, can I talk to you for a second?  Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?

NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!

He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.

No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!

You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.  I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.

What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!

That's fine!  People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!

What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?

So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! 

I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!

I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.

Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.

Which one? We make lists all the time.

Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!

This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!

Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?

Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.

No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.

Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!

Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!

Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!

James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.

See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?

Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!

Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-

But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?

But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it.

You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.

I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.

Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's just not something we do flippantly! There's protocol!

That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.

We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. 

No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.

I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.

Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-

Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!

No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.

My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.

Hello?  My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."

The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!

Many would rather die than go to those places!

Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.

Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!

Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.

Well, not if it's Cartman.  Hey, where are you all going!  They don't even know what Walden is.  I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.

He doesn't even know what he wrote about!

So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! 

Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!

No, it's okay, Stan!  Everything's going to be o-kay!

I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? 

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!  He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now.

Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?

This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.

I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this. 

This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-

-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.

Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!

Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!

I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 

And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.

You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams".

I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.

Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?

Hey Jessie , hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange.

As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.

Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides . We select the eyes , make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin , lengthen the neck , add more to the hair , select the lips and make them fuller , take out any puffiness on the skin  here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin , streamline the shoulders , put highlights in the eyes , and, there.

Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.

I know. Let's do "Light as a feather, stiff as a board."  Who wants to do it first?

Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!

You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends!

Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.

Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. 

Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!

Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher.

That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! 

Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.

Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-

It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!

Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.

Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!

No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends.

Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.

We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!

Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.

Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?

Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-

So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!

You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!  Bye, Ms. Ellen.

Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!

Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.

Oh. Hi, Stan.  I think it worked, Bebe.

Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?

No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you

I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.

But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?

It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.

"I think you look cute in your bunny costume." What is that supposed to mean?!

And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,  and I've learned from it.  I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world.

Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. 

Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-

There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. 

Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. 

AAAAAAaaaah!  Brrrrr. What's wrong with me?  Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. 

You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?

East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. 

How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!

Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!

When someone gets as old as you,  do they have to wear Depends undergarments? 

And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to "In a relationship"!

I think we went too far with Marjorine.

Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! 

Something that should have been done a long time ago! 

You can't bribe your way out of this!

That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!

Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.

It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.

Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.

I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca. 

Wait, wait!  It's time to whip out the eclipse shoebox thing!  Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen.

You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.

Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!

I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.

Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.

If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!

Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad.

I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school.

Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.

When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-

I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.

I'm totally back to normal. See you later. 

That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. 
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! 

Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.

You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!

I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.

What the hell do you think you're doing?

That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe.

I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!

Why?!  Why are you doing this to me?!  Why won't you just stop?!

I'm class president! The vote was last fall!

Dad, there's a new store at the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!

I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.

The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the… the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-  ah…  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...

Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.

Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.

Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.

Nono, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.

Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover.

Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?

No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.

Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.

Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 

I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-

You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?

You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!

...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  I'm asking you a question! 

Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.

Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? 

Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-

You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?

If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?

You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?
