Look George, I'm friends with both of you. But I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything.
Elaine. I don't understand why you can't meet someone else's parents without classifying it as a date.
Well maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together.
No way. So I'll see you Saturday night?
I am going to Montreal tomorrow and they sell them dirt cheap.
Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her.
Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner.
There nice people. I thought you would like them.
All right I buy a box and give to Elaine.
Well I am getting a cab want to join me?
Hey, if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere?
Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date?
