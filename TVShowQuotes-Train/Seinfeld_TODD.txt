Hey, if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere?
Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner.
Well I am getting a cab want to join me?
I am going to Montreal tomorrow and they sell them dirt cheap.
There nice people. I thought you would like them.
Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date?
Well maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we can sweep together.
Look George, I'm friends with both of you. But I can't betray her confidence by telling you anything.
Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk to her.
No way. So I'll see you Saturday night?
All right I buy a box and give to Elaine.
Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry.
