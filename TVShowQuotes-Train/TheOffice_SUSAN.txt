That's not true, is it?
Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.
But it is something.
Got it.
Why do you keep looking at my husband?
Oh, that is so cute-
You sure about that?
Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
Hello nice to meet you.
Aw, let me see-
Andy.
Have you had any?
Why would you not want me working here?
I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
Who walks around with their passport?
You didn���t say goodbye to your grandma.
It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
No games?
For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?
Well, different circumstances.
Who knows?
Well make that a red wine and I���ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
Oh, Ryan.
No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
Answer the question, please.
Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
Do you not want me here?
Hi.
Robert...
It's a date.
So what happens next?
Jim...
I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
Andy?
Maybe after all this settles down...
[Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]
I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?
Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
