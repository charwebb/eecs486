You didn���t say goodbye to your grandma.
Robert...
Have you had any?
Andy?
[Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]
You sure about that?
Well make that a red wine and I���ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there���s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don���t we just let it go.
Hello nice to meet you.
Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
Maybe after all this settles down...
That's not true, is it?
Jim...
Why do you keep looking at my husband?
I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
Why would you not want me working here?
For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?
Aw, let me see-
Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.
Do you not want me here?
But it is something.
I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
Well, different circumstances.
Oh, Ryan.
Got it.
No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles]
It's a date.
Andy.
No games?
Hi.
Answer the question, please.
I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?
Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
So what happens next?
Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
