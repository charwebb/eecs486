Aw, let me see-
Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
Why would you not want me working here?
Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there���s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don���t we just let it go.
Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.
Answer the question, please.
Maybe after all this settles down...
No games?
Hi.
You sure about that?
I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
So what happens next?
Got it.
[Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]
Have you had any?
I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
Oh, Ryan.
Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles]
Robert...
Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
You didn���t say goodbye to your grandma.
I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?
Jim...
Well make that a red wine and I���ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
Why do you keep looking at my husband?
Who knows?
Do you not want me here?
For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?
Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
But it is something.
Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
Who walks around with their passport?
Andy?
It's a date.
Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
Oh, that is so cute-
