I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
Why would you not want me working here?
Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
[Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]
Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
Why do you keep looking at my husband?
Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
Well make that a red wine and I���ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there���s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don���t we just let it go.
Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?
Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles]
Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.
It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
