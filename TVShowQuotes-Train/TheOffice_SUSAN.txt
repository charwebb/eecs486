Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles]
Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
[Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]
Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.
It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
Why do you keep looking at my husband?
No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there���s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don���t we just let it go.
Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
Why would you not want me working here?
Well make that a red wine and I���ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
