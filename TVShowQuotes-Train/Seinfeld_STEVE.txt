Hey, you want in on this?
I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.
You think so?
What're you doing down here?
I'm not gonna steal anything.
What's in it for me?
What are you talking about?
That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?
Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
Hey Cosmo.
Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.
Don't be so enthusiastic.
Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.
Kramer, right?
Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
I'll go first.
Jerry, this is Patti.
No problem.
He he, go for it.
(hysterical) Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?
I understand.
Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away) Ouch. (To Jerry) Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.
Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.
Yeah. Let's have lunch.
What's the plan?
I think I can do that.
Jerry, baby!
No, I just live here.
Ah, look who's here.
I'm waiting for my ride.
(drunk and slurring) Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry
Hey, I might take you up on that.
Hey, this is for close friends only.
I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.
See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.
What about it?
See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.
