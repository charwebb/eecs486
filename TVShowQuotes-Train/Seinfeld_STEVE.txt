Jerry, baby!
Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.
I understand.
I think I can do that.
You think so?
He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?
Yeah. Let's have lunch.
Yeah, so?
What's the plan?
Hey Cosmo.
I'll go first.
Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.
Hey, you want in on this?
What's in it for me?
That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.
No, I just live here.
I'm not gonna steal anything.
He he, go for it.
Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.
What're you doing down here?
Hey, this is for close friends only.
See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.
Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
Ah, look who's here.
See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.
No problem.
(drunk and slurring) Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry
I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.
What are you talking about?
Don't be so enthusiastic.
You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.
I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.
Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away) Ouch. (To Jerry) Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.
Somebody's going to make that crap?
Jerry, this is Patti.
Hey, I might take you up on that.
