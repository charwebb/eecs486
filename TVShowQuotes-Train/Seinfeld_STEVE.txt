(hysterical) Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?
(drunk and slurring) Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry
Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away) Ouch. (To Jerry) Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.

Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?
I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.
That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
