Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.
What about it?
What are you talking about?
Kramer, right?
Hey, you want in on this?
(hysterical) Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?
I'm waiting for my ride.
What's in it for me?
No problem.
You think so?
No, I just live here.
You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.
He he, go for it.
Jerry, baby!
Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away) Ouch. (To Jerry) Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.
Hey, this is for close friends only.
Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.
I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.
Don't be so enthusiastic.
I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.
I'm not gonna steal anything.
Ah, look who's here.
I think I can do that.
Hey Cosmo.
See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.
Yeah, so?
What're you doing down here?
I'll go first.
I understand.
Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
What's the plan?
Hey, I might take you up on that.
Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.
(drunk and slurring) Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry
Yeah. Let's have lunch.
That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
Jerry, this is Patti.
