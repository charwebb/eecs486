I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.
Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.
Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
(hysterical) Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?
Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.
Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.
See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.
Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away) Ouch. (To Jerry) Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.
Hey, I might take you up on that.
I don't know, but I gotta do this more often. (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.
(drunk and slurring) Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry
See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.
Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.
He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?
