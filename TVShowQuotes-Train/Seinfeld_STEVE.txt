You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.
Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
I think I can do that.
Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.
Yeah, he's a hoot. Oh, goodbye, my dear. (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away) Ouch. (To Jerry) Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.
(drunk and slurring) Oh Jerry! Jerry! Look who's here, it's Jerry
Somebody's going to make that crap?
Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.
He he, go for it.
Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.
I understand.
I'll go first.
You think so?
Maybe we should call one of those escort services. I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.
Don't be so enthusiastic.
What're you doing down here?
Yeah, so?
Ah, look who's here.
I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break. I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.
What's the plan?
No, I just live here.
Hey, you want in on this?
No problem.
What are you talking about?
What's in it for me?
(hysterical) Ah, they turned brown!! Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?
He split. Let me ask you something. Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?
What about it?
Kramer, right?
Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.
I'm waiting for my ride.
Hey, this is for close friends only.
See ya, Jerr. And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.
Jerry, baby!
That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
Hey, I might take you up on that.
I'm not gonna steal anything.
