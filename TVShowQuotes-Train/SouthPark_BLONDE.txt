Il est si comme Jerry Lewis!!! (He's just like Jerry Lewis!!!) 
Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right with you.
I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen.
I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.  I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
He-e-ey, man, I overheard what you said; that was coool!
And then she goes, "Fine! Don't come home!", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap.
And I go, "Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"
So I go, "Fine! I won't come home!"
Would you like to come over to my place and finger-paint?
Hey guys, welcome to Raisins. Six of you?  Right over here. 
Oh well, I guess it beats living at home.
And she goes, "Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"
Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it.
Well, Chef, where's this amazing thing you were going to show us.
Let's get married and have a honeymoon in India.
