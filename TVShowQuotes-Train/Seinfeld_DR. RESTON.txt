Excuse me. Yes, Oh yes, Bobo. Uh, no it's just east of Madison. Around 400 will be fine. All right Bobo ... see you then. (hangs up) . . . I'm sorry where were we?
I was just thinking about this patient of mine.
Are you afraid to tell me his name?
Elaine, I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It's very important that I speak to him.
You can do it and you will do it.
It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.
And how often have you been seeing, um . . .? I'm sorry what is his name?
Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again?
Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name?
