I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Woooo!
Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.
The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
Well here's what I've been doing around here.   It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
Okay, no.
People Magazine, crossword puzzle, keep or toss?
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
Well it is business, but not as usual.
A waffle?
Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.
Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
Ah.
I don't know if Michael and Jan really went to Jamaica, because Michael's way into Photoshop. For example, I never went with him to Egypt. [holds up picture with Michael and himself in Egypt]
Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Will do.
That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
Is your wife still your contact?
I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
Instead of $5,000 a year from now?
No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
Look on the windshield.'
Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
For my current investors, things are going great.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, if you don't mind.
Um...  Yeah, absolutely.
When people see this presentation, they���re gonna [bleep] in their pants.
Out.
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
How about rainbows?
You're my friend, Michael.  OK?
Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course.
Jan.
Awesome.
Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
Dwight?
Any other questions? [Kelly's hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.
What was that first thing you did?
Where is it?
Creed did you organize the menu book?
Yes, I'm coming to your wedding.
It did, all ready.
Yeah, I might stop by.
...I don't.
Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
I finally mastered commitment.
Hey, are you going to Poor Richard's?
Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like���z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
Yeah, Christmas.
I don't have a key.
It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
What are you doing here?
Yeah.
I can get there.
[to Kevin] You scared me.
I'm your boss.
Bottle service ya'll?
All right.
Oh.
Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
Andy.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
That's all he wrote?
Are we staying til five?
I forget it, brutha.
Hey.
All right.
Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
I'll go.
What?
Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I'd forget too.
So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
It's all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He's a genius. You guys just don't get him.
No, not yet.
Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
What kind do you like?
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Hell yeah. I'll hook it up. [smashes beer bottle on the floor]
Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.
[talking to Kelly in dumpster] Hey, Kelly, you know what? Throw my gift away, too.
What's the halal option?
I gotta work on this.
All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
[points to Jim] Will do. [points to Michael] Won't do.
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.
Soda.
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
I'd like to see him try. [kisses Kelly... cell phone beeps]
The other way.
I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead]
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
Don't vaccinate it.
Hey ��� asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
No, I said your idea was stupid.
I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
That is not correct.
Twenty.
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
No.
Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises]
Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring?
He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
[entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet?  I've got Michael's lucky tie.
What are those, a men's ten?
You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
My mom also makes the best salsa.
All right.
You really think you're going to go?
Tough.
Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Hey man, you ever think there's gonna be this massive nuclear holocaust, and after all the major nations are destroyed they'll just be the tribes in the jungle that rise up and survive? The jungle war fare's gonna rule the world?
Guys, one second. [on dance videogame]
We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
Kelly.
Are you holding this chair?
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
���cause I feel like I���m gonna fall off.
[on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
Literally.
[whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
Eh, a little bit.
Fudge?
What's the occasion?
I'm doing something over here.
Hi, nice to meet you.
I am very flattered. I was his second choice after 'Pass.'
Why wouldn't they let me dance?
Is Jim coming back.
It���s really, really good Robert.  Let me explain.
Yeah, let's do it that way.
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
Yo!
I mean whatever one you want.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
We're behind.
Thank you.
[seems unsure] Everything... Everything.
Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.
I think I heard it on Roy's side.
Living in the moment.
Dehydration.
[tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
It's not fair to you.  And it's really not fair to me.
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
Yeah.
I went to Fort Lauderdale.
He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
I won't look at it.
I think about that all the time.
Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]
The Washington University Public Health Fund.
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
Yes. I'm very excited.
What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!' WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Wow.
Oh, great.
Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Fun, communication, connection.
Ah, well, I'm interested in business.
Yeah me too.
Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
No.
Yeah, New York is great.
Actually Ryan.
This is company-wide, Dwight.
[still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Hello.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
Yeah.
I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
Thank you. Whatcha got there?
That we're having any problem at all.
My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
Cool. Cool. OK.
Merry Christmas. [hands over a gift]
Oh, this, this is not my apartment.  This, this is the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
No.
Um... God, so many, Nellie!
Thought you checker my Tumblr?
Yeah.
Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Everyone's like, 'Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?' Or, Uh, 'Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!'
How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Who uses calling cards anymore?
Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
What's the dress code on this?
Michael, how's it going, bro?
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
[catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
That's... great, I... that's awesome.
Oh my god!
I know, but you wanted the big thing.
I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
Whoo!
[sigh]
Do you have a question Kelly?
Not really.  New York is...so great.
Yeah, totally.
Awesome!
No, no, no, no, no.
Profound man, your husband.
A credit.
All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
To madness.
No, she's lying.
Stop. Stop it Andy.
Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.
You should enter it in festivals!
This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
[knocks on office wall] Hey.
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
Oh! ���Fix��� means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
Oh, no, I didn't know.
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
Kay.
The glasses are a little...  [Dwight drops glasses to the floor, stomps on them]
With gift baskets.
You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
I'd like to make a toast to the troops.  All the troops.  Both sides.
How's everybody doing?!
I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
I'm already in business school.
Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
No.
I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
Michael it's not... It's not...
Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company.
Do you like The Hives?
Cool.
[at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
I don't want to be like 'a guy' here. You know? Like, Stanley is the 'crossword puzzle guy'. And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the 'something guy'.
Twice.
No. It would cause me too much pain.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over.  OK.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Yeah, yeah.
They had no yams.
[Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
[throwing up]
Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.
I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
To both these bears.
Yeah.
Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
The only good bagels anywhere.
You don't?
[walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
Kelly, I'm so cold!
Hello, what do we have here?
You know what?  Now I remember.  That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea.
Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
We can spend a couple days there.
No, I, I was going to say hazel, yeah.
[whispering] Who is it?
Yep, that is a problem.
Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
What are you talking about?
No, man.  You're-- you're fine.
Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
I love it.
I stretched before I came.
But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
That's all right, Pam.  Michael's got it. [Michael and Ryan look at each other for 5 seconds]
Yeah, I think I can handle it.
Whoopi Goldberg.
I mean the guy I used to be.  I'm Ryan 2.0 and if it makes you feel any better, that guy did a lot of messed up stuff to me too. [tries to walk away]
I���m sorry,��� L���?
[reading checklist] Fun jeans.
Uh huh.
He takes what he wants.
No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
Um, I don't...
And you brought this guy!
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
Don't jump Agent Scarn! There are no parachutes!
It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is: How do we make this a better party?
...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
Why would I lie about a performance review?
[to Dwight, Michael and Troy] It's off. It's not the dude I know. It's some other loser who won't let us in without chicks.
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
What's up? Nice to meet you.
What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Pam's better at that stuff
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Um...
I think.
Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.
Thanks.
[to Michael] Have a seat with everybody else.
They said something about Zach Braff.
He called me Fire Guy.
Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
Nice.
A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
Absolutely.
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
Take the call, friend.
[to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
$650 bucks
That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
[to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.
We'll have to talk about this.
I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
Oh, thanks, man.
Wow, um... Sorry you had to...
Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
I'm pretty sure Jan said that we're not supposed to.
I... wouldn't even know where to start.
Yeah.
Ok, to what?
I would love to.
I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
[both inside dumpster] Did you look over here?
Chiklis style.
[stops kissing Kelly] I can't do this.
Seems like it's leaning one way.
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
... Yeah.
He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. He's the top salesman at the company. Today's gonna be great.
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Huh.
People keep calling me a 'Wunderkind'; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
Thank you everybody.
No, no, no.  Sir, don't listen.
Chappelle's Show.
I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
What's the hard way?
That���s why my foundation ��� The Dream for a Wish Foundation ��� is going to put them out of business. They���re not going to know what hit them.
Great. She's cute, huh?
It's great to see you Kev.
David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
[in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
alright.  See you there.
Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
I didn't want anything else, so I figured at least I could give it to a homeless guy.
WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
I'm good, thanks.
You were let go.
My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
[glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list]
I'd die for you too.
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about...
[joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
Who was that?
Is that it?
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Is there a prize?
So...
[a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
Good. That is great to hear.
I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
[to Kelly] If you get into season 1, you can really...
Cool.
What?
I've missed you too...
The company's probably going under, though.
Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.
Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
You a big William Hung fan?
Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
Now I have it.
Yeah, I liked them too.
Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs.
Stop calling us ���guys���.
At three different places.
You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
No, don't. Don't do that.
Hey, anybody see a pair of sunglasses?
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
Sure, last year you guys were riding me really hard for the website and I just peeled out my Z3 and I knocked the mirror off somebody's car.  I never said a thing.
You should come visit.  The city is... amazing.
You are very welcome.
So who's leading this thing, anyway?
It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
What about a long sleeve T?
You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
You lied about being pregnant.
We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
You know what?
What do you make, secretary?
I-
Then do it.
Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
I bet you did.
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything.
And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
Flash cards. Doesn't really help me right now because I'm on a boat.
Uh, fine. What's up?
Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about...
Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
Looks like they forgot the power cord.
[playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
I'm really uncomfortable.
The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
Kelly don't do this.
It's called owling. You'll read about it in like eight months.
You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Do you mean Neverland?
Fourth quarter projections for Jan?
Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
Yes.
And you know that I���m capable of this.
Hey, you.
[looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up]
Ok thanks Michael.
Thanks.
Yes.
Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
Did this happen on company property?
Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
I go to a lot of parties.
Huh, is it ok if I call her?
It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
We totally should.
OK. OK.
I'm so psyched you're here!
One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have...
Yeah that's great.
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Stop flustering me, everybody!
If I have to answer for everything that guy did... [shakes head] I'm never gonna move on.
[pulls out Blackberry] When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. [phone rings, computer chimes, printer starts up]
The temp agency wants to know what you think.
No you don't.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
I want an outsider.
Huh?
Well...
Has to be done. We'll press send together. [phone beeps]
Hey. I got the information.
Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
Right. Okay.
We did it !
[laughs] Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
You too.
At home, not on a boat?
Quick question.
Are you happy you did?
Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
Pack my--?
You guys, um, talking Senator?
[in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
Hey, I'm WUPHF.
Rock the house!
If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
I'd be satisfied with eight.
It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.
Ugh.
Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
OK, what's up?
What do you want me to do?
I never went to Thailand.
I felt terrorized.
They really didn't like me.
Do you really know which one is correct?
Did you want a place where we could meet older women?
What's your number?
[muttering] Sometimes you over react.
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
T-Dog?
Totally, we should both work out.
But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
I can't- I can't not touch it.
This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
Two pools. A divider. A bridge. Good choice. It says everything about everything, right Robert?
Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
Good work, buddy.
I'm betting on myself.
Um That's... That's fair. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. [Ryan starts walking away.]
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
I'm really sorry, Dwight.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
It's going okay. I've already learned more about beet agriculture than I ever thought I'd know.
Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
Yeah, punch him.
Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.
Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?
Yeah. Yeah.
Michael? Are you done yet?
In you go.
Go make a copy, secretary.
Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
F and C, doubletime?
Unreal.
Ok.
Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.
You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
Yeah.
[walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.
Wait, can you go back?
What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
[on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it���s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it���s different because it���s your wife? ��Well, that doesn���t make any sense to me.
I love you.
[speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
I can't imagine what I would have done.
Me too.
Just put it out of your mind.
Ah man, I can't.
[image on Pyramid] Sabre... It���s time... to come home.
I've always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?
Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes.
What's that?
Actually, I had mine already.
As an object.
I like it, I like it! [Pam flips the page]
I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did.  And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie.  ... It was two hundred dollars.
Yeah.
Good.
America is one big mall.
I know.
Yeah!
Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
Explain what you think that is.
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
A dime and a nickel.
Yeah.
Ok.
Oh, awesome.
I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
That's actually a test prep book.
[again catching Jim looking at him] What?
They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.
For Kelly?
Yeah.
Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn.
Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
That--- I, um... cool.  Well maybe I'll see you around.
All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
What did you think of the presentation?
Fraud, Jim, Fraud.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
[whispering] I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
Exactly.
I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
I don't know.  Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool.
Uhm...
This is... totally unnecessary.
Okay.
You have another job?
Huh? [puts on jacket]
Don't you see why that's insane?
Okay.
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
You helped me get off drugs!
Well, it's empty.
I am.
I can eat.
One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
[sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
[on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
You got to... you got to give it to me again.
I don't do that stuff anymore.
Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
You know what?  I didn't---
Um... unless you really, really want it back.
No.
I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
I have something.
[holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
So, how are you?
Nice. Send me a postcard.
How's it going?  Good day?
Free sample?
Robert, you are too kind.
Yeah, you left the price tag on.
Definitely.
Can't really tell the...
No.
She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
And if I flake, I flake.
When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking 'I'm a little too old for this.'  And I was
I am.
We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?
I'm on Michael.
What are the criteria for going?
OK. Should we get started?
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
Good luck Michael.
Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
You know, every time I think I hit rock bottom at my job, the floor opens up, like at a carnival ride. I'm gonna retrace my steps. College, four-year degree, student loans, business school, alone in a beet field. I... there's a step missing. 'Hey, mom.' 'Hey, Ryan. How's that five-year plan coming?' 'Oh, it's great. Today, I knelt down in cow manure and I got abandoned in a beet field.' 'Oh, that's cool.' 'Yeah, that's really cool. I'm learning a lot. I'm really glad I took this full-time job.'
No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
May I go first?
You've never had Pad Thai.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
Got it.
I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
Yeah.  Maybe.
Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up]
How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
You did. Yeah.
Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.
At these prices with this service...
I am so sorry.
He hasn't even said a word yet.  Just giggling.
I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I've changed.
I'll use it when you're done.
That looks great.
You know what you're doing.
Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
Yeah.
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?
Fine. He actually gave me a small raise, which I did not ask for. [hits vending machine] It's stuck. [Dwight begins throwing his entire body into the vending machine] It's cool, it fell.
Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
Hi.
Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings]
Could we talk off the record? As friends?
Look under the sink in the men's room.'
Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
But...
Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
Look, I feel you okay?  That guy took no responsibility for his actions.
I really did not do anything.
He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
We can't do this Dwight.
What's her address? [Ryan's cell phone rings]
Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
Hello?
You should've sent me a WUPHF.
Can you get me a cold water?
[kisses for a little longer]  What's up?
Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
I can't wait to meet him.
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
[chuckles] Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Can't wait. A folk colonialist gathering when unemployment's at 9%. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
You���re so ignorant. You barely know what you���re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
I have the emergency contacts.
Um... also--
I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Huh?
Hey, is Katy coming?
Take care, man.
Will you marry me Holly?
You don't have to keep saying 'I do declare'.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
Don't interrupt.
Gotcha.
It's not irrelevant. Details
[from behind the door] Is there internet?
-and you jump in front of them.
That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
Will you roll those dice with me?
Cause he's totally gay? [walks away]
I'll check them all.
Sorry, dude.
What?
Nick.
I can't believe I started the fire.
All of a sudden?
Cool.
I know it's you guys.
On my God. You���re so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his... [Michael hangs up on Ryan]
No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.
I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
That was your choice; don't put that on me.  I'm just going on a little trip.
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
Hey.
Yup.
Michael was on an egg-yolk diet. He's so weird.
Uh, Shemp.
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
[to Dwight] Don't...
Love it. Go.
Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
Are you scared?
You think of something then!
I don't think you know what you're saying.
Well that was funny, that's why.
Hello?
Yeah! That was the idea.
Where is Tibet?
[reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
You are toxic! You are toxic!
Yeah.
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.
I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
I don't want ketchup.
I didn't think it did.
[at a loss for words]
[notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man.
[getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin.
Just started.
[Under his breath] Still.
No, you don't...
[to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard.
Uh, okay, two?
Kelly...
Yeah?
I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.
It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
[walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
Okay, everyone, I have a conference call, but after that, I'm going to lead a BlackBerry tutorial for anyone who's having any problems.  Who here's set theirs up? [Jim and Andy raise their hands; Phyllis half-raises hers.  Ryan notices that Michael does not raise his]  Great.  Well, I will see the rest of you at 2:30.
[exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
Yup.
Yeah, discuss these things--
Hey.
Okay, I'm turning it off.
I'd give 35% to AIDS related charities. 25%. If they can't cure AIDS with 25%, the extra ten's not gonna make a difference. At some point, you're just throwing good money after bad.
I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not?
I did not see Rango.
It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
Everything seems pretty much under control.
Blue.
[jumps in front of camera] Wuphf.com!
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
Kelly's helping?
[making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
Same with coffee, and women.
That's what I told him.  Thanks. [leaves]
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
Baby, Baby, Baby--
Catch-22.
You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
I did.
Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.
Sabre. It���s time to come home.
Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
Dwight.
I did.
Yeah. It's another note.
I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
What?
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
Yeah, I mean, it looks real good, probably.
Say ���hi���, Drake.
So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
Did you see Saw?
Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
What about this bottle of power drink?
This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
No. [Dwight starts singing in German]
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
Good.
You look so classy in that picture.
...It wasn't personal.
Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
Thank you.
[to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
No don't take that, give that back!
Are you having fun in this relationship?
That's a test prep for business school.
Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
Can you find out?
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
It's my -
You're kidding?
Whoa, whoa.
[answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk...  this is great timing.
I won't.
Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
Thanks.
What?
Bitttch!
At least we're outside.
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
Michael and everybody, umm...
Yeah!
Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
Stop that! Stop that!
Here's the way trends move across the country. They start in Japan. L.A. And New York get it soon after that. Seattle looks at it, decides not to do it. Chicago gets it three months later. Then it travels down the Mississippi, OK? All the red states start doing it. Good Morning America does a piece about it. And then, it shows up in Scranton.
Well, it sounds like you know what you want. [Pam walks away] It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
Gordon Gekko.
Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
I know what I said.
Okay.
I'm trying but you need to-
Not really.
Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny.
Thank you, Erin. Woof!
No! I will... go.
... Later guys.
No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
No no no.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
When was China founded?
What?
Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
Don't you mean constructive criticism?
We heard about the punch.
This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
Nine?
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
Two HR reps.
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
Yeah.
You sure?
I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen.  Do you?
OK, (we'll just dismiss it.)??????
I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
That is so awesome man!
[unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod.
That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
Mmm-hmm.
Yes!
You're inviting Jim?
You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
Depression?
Kelly, come on.
Maybe we should get some air.
Robert I hate to interrupt.  But I would love to pitch you one last idea.  I call it the Big Mac idea.
TBD. Phyllis?
No, this little guy is mine.
Write a book.
Okay, do you  like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Haha, nice!  I guess I have been a stranger lately.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
Great.
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Why no kids?
I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.
You.  Us.
He's bluffing, Pam.
Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
No, it's whomever.
Kelly.
Yes.
Yeah. [Michael closes the door]
Uh, fun jeans.
Oh, that's nice.
Didn't you two date for like a long time?
Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Oh, no.
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
That's good. They're creative, you're not.
Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
Yeah, close one.
Okay... uh, sorry?
I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?
Michael.
No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
Smokey's dead.
That's really funny.
Think fast. [it hits her in the face] Honestly, Pam, the bagels in New York are the only good bagels in the world, I swear to God.
An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
We have actual work to do.
What?
Yeah, it's crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
You're doing it man.
Good. What's up?
Have some faith in this idea!
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
Wallace likes Jim.  So going after him - that's a risky move for me, but in business, you gotta take risks.  Sometimes you gotta get out on the open highway, with the top down [pushes button about eight times to get the top down.  Finally it comes down and it's all bunched up.  As he's fixing it, the car rolls backwards a bit.]
Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
My assignment is to make a temporary disabled parking permit for Michael Scott.
Hello?
I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
I like extra cheese.
Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you. [Michael, Pam, Daryl, and Stanley raise their hands]
It says flavor: Blue Blast.
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
Get off my ass, you hag.
[louder] Six months?��� um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
Really?
That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
Yes, I'll do it.
He's rubbing his neck.
Kelly, you���re here.
They have business classes there?
I think it's worth it.
[colorful poster with numbers] Check this out.
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
Yeah.
Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
Sixty thousand dollars a year.
Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
With vodka, you're the best.
Yes, yes, yes!
Sometimes he brings more costumes.
Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
What?
What?
You like the Fleebulls, The Glorps?
I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.  I got Jim's uh, old job.  Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will
Who is Mao?
Thanks.
Updating emergency contacts.
Yeah... Who's opening?
What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
Hey.
Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
No, that was mandatory.
Hey.
Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press 'send'.
Thank you very much.
Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?
Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back]
Mm-hmm.
Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
Right. Think different, from Apple.
I actually got that for you. I had you originally.
It's an investment.
Ryan Howard.
But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?
All the time.
Like Frodo!
You don't want to recycle them?
Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
Yes. You alone do, actually.
Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
Okay, we're never technically... um is there.. Is there a problem?
Hey, this is fun.
Thank you.
Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
We're not doing this today.
Yeah, isn't that messed up?
Yeah.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?
I'm good! How are you? So...
Right.
I���ve actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It���s a big university town. And, uh, that���s not garbage, it���s out clothes.
Yeah, yeah I'll see them.
Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door]
Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
Finally.
Okay. Do you like The Strokes?
Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
[as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.
Perfect.
They were out.
Darryl Rogers?
I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool!
Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
I insist you take your work calls.
Ok, elephant in the room.  Let's talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So...
Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
Yeah, sure.
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
Yes!
Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
I don't know, maybe.
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
Oh, my God.
This poem would crush you!
One second.
[pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, Stanley, do you -
Uh, no thanks, I'm good.
That's... That's not the point!
What's up?
Yeah.
Na.
What line of work you in, Bob?
Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
OK. This is...
[looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?
Well, I updated it.
Let's be adults about this.  Let's have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
Why are you being so weird about this?
Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
Oh...
I am not giving you my keys.
You're taking two?
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
This guy owns his own beet farm.
Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
Oh, neat.
And he's really into penguins or something?
Hey Michael.
Yeah!
I want the same thing you want.  I want to take Jim Halpert down.  I want in.
Just Curly. Joe DeRita was different.
Things have been generally good.
Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
OK.
Michael.
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
Don't just criticize my idea!
[whispering] Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
How would...
Yes, I--
...It doesn't apply.
Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
No. [shaking head] We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
Keep going. [Whispers]
No no, I want to go.
Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
Oh, yeah, totally.
It's inevitable, right?
Quit it!
No you weren't.
Back? Why is that Michael?
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
This is from the sun.
Don���t talk to me right now. I���m sorry. I- I know you���re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don���t understand is... [voice fades]
Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
[whispers] Yeah.
Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
I don't know Kelly, sometimes I look at us and I think...
Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
Yeah.
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
I'd love to talk to you about it more.
Is that your Cousin Mose?
Look under the suggestion box.' 'I can't believe I kept this up all day.' Signed, me.
It's not that kind of trip.  I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go.  And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
C.C. me
Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
It was indescribable.
I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
The domain name. Yeah, they do.
Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
18 across. Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.' Michael wrote, 'Judd?'
How long do you think it���s been up there, Kevin?
We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
I'd rather not say.
[steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]
[grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these.
Yes Michael?
Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
We're never getting back together.
Write it down.
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor.  I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We're going guerrilla.  We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin' paper just became fun.
And you got a goatee!
Sorry man.
Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
How much memory does it have without the booster?
I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
Yes.
Michael.
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Yuh.
Hey.
What size shoes are you guys?
Um... [To the Buyers] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
Yeah, me too.
Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
I told you not to call about small problems.
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Okay.
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
No, you're perfect. [Kelly gasps] What? Did you find it?
Good for you, man. Good for you.
No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
[catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What?
That guy did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
Michael, you  haven't even heard--
I'm going to put everything in terms of 'real dollars'.
We're never going to get what need from that guy. [still shaking head, pats Kevin on the shoulder and walks out of the kitchen]
That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
[stands up] Everything.  She's perfect.
Aww!
Here you go.
Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn���t the fact that I���m in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
Um, yeah. [shakes her hand] Ryan.
Yeah?
I know where we're not.
I spent three years, driving around, getting him yams and magic wands.  He can get me water.
Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
We're back.
This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]
[walks in the office] How's my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].
Okay.
Yeah.
Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
OK...
Probably, yes.
Maybe.
No.
Uh, is that a vibrator?
How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
Hey.
Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
We have seven fewer boxes of Canariola copier paper in stock than we're supposed to.
But the other one is. I've heard that before.
Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
The ones that say '39 cents.'
Let's bail. [starts to leave]
No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept.
We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
Cool.
I get that.
For two years, and it's only at night, and then it's on your resume forever.
Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
Oh, how did I not guess that?
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
Oh, so close. Eighty-one.
But if he doesn't?
I got the stamps.
