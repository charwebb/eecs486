What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?
I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.
What, Inspector butters figured out I set him up?!
I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.
No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters.
You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?
Butters, come on! Try and come back to us!  You can't run forever!  Excuse me, did someone order a pizza?  Yes, that was me, but I'm a little busy at the moment. I'll be right back!  You'll never turn me in, Inspector Butters! You're dead!
Oh dear. It's okay, Butters. You just think you're Inspector Butters right now.
You don't understand! For some reason the mean man is getting stronger. You have to help me find out how to stop him! Please! 
He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well.
They're all idiots! The vault! Get to the vault! Come on! Go! Movie it!  Get this on and get in that vault! That's where the real good are!   Torch that door, do you hear me?! I'll kill your parents! I'll kill your friends! I said get that fucking door open!
You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.
Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?
Oh, hello Butters. I wasn't expecting you till 5:30.
You aren't leaving here, Inspector! None of you are!
Butters? Butters, what are you doing? What is that? A blowtorch? Put that down! You're having another episode!
Dr. Janus sure has a big house, dudn't he? He's planning on hurting people; I just know it!
No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point.  What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication.
Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles.
From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.
I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.
Oh, so you're on to me, huh you little shit?!
If you draw any attention he'll kill us!
What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
We have to try and understand that he can't help what he's doing, officer. He probably has no memory of it at all.
There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named "Postman Butters" and yet another is "Fireman Butters." And then there's even "Inspector Butters" and uh, "Professor Chaos".
Oh boy, you've really done it this time. I know it's not your fault, but I'm sorry. I'm going to have to alert the authorities, pal.
Yeah!  Butteers, what are you doing in my house?
Butters. Your name is Butters! Try and remember!
Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?
This is kinda fun. You're Inspector Butters and I'm your faithful assistant, Dr. Watson!
Butters please! It's me, Billy! You've gotta help!  Please, Butters, I've tried to tell old Dr. Janus that we're in danger, but Dr. Janus doesn't rrealize thaere's a problem!  The mean man that lives in our head is trying to take over for good!
And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?
