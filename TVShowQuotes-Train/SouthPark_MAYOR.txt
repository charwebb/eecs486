Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?

And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!

Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!

We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, butâ€¦ 

Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?

Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.

Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca.  You are truly South Park's finest. 

God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-

Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best.  And who's our little prize winner again?

You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. 

Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals;  where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.  But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!  And now, let's kick off our weeklong festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!  Let's hear it for these brave souls!  What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators! 

Oh my God!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!

All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school.  Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral.

Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!

We're all going to die in this horrible place. 

Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady! 

Children, as you all know, Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.

Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!

My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.

How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?

Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!

No, but look! He's got a little smile now!  See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think?  Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?

Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. 

Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country.

Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? 

You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?

Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!

Just don't answer any more questions, got it?

Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.

My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.

People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...

Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh.  Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.

All we know right now is that some of our children  are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?

Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!

Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?

Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue? 

Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.  Wait a minute... It's the snake! 

We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?

Having to do with a lake or ocean.

...is your favorite celebrity, and mine  Kathie Lee Gifford! 

It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.

Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!

Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.

Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!

Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!

Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?

Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like...

So I guess you wanna do some campaigning.  You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up...

This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?

Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.

Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!

Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.

But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?

Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?

Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. 

...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you. 

It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park. 

This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year.

Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!

Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!

Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!

Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!

No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.

Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa--  Oooooogh...

You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!

Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?

But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right? 

Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.

O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.

Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.

An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!

Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!! 

The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene. 

Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!

I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.

Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!

No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!

All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave.

Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!!

And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kaufman...

Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. 

Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!

But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.

All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!  Let's go, people! There's no time to lose! 

Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.

Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!

Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.  Aw, hell..!

All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals!  This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary.

Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? 

Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are.

Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!

Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.

And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!

Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school.  All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious."

Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day.  Let's have ice cream, everyone! 

Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.

Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!

Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay! 

This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.  Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag! 

Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do.

Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?

Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.

Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.

You can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1  All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.

Yes, you know, expire, end.  Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?

It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.

I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.

Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.

Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play. 

Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.

We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?

Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip

Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.

Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!

Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. 

My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.

I noticed! Call the National Guard!  Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch.  And to think I actually watched your HBO special.

Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.

Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.

Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.

Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?

Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever! 

Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!

Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. 

Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly. 

Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell.

Children are fickle.  All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.

Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there.

Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say "yippee."

Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.

Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman.  Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr. 

You have to wait until I ask the question first.

That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?
