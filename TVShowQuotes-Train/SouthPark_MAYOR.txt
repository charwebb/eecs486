But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right? 
Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.
Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?
Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.  Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats! 
Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.
Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? 
Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. 
Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs!  Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France!  And, all one of you lucky constetants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?
Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. 
This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
Children, as you all know, Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.
I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.
You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!
Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue? 
Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like...
Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip
Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh.  Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.
So I guess you wanna do some campaigning.  You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up...
Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?
People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...
Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!
We're all going to die in this horrible place. 
Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do.
And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!
Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there.
Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!
O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.
Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!
Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.
Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are.
Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school.  All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious."
Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!
Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?
The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene. 
Children are fickle.  All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say "yippee."
I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.
Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.
Well, there's no going back now.  We're cannibals.  God save us.
Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!
Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!
Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.
Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!! 
You have to wait until I ask the question first.
Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
Oh my God!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!
Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!
Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!
...is your favorite celebrity, and mine  Kathie Lee Gifford! 
I noticed! Call the National Guard!  Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch.  And to think I actually watched your HBO special.
Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!
It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park. 
Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.  Aw, hell..!
Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.
Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!
Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!
Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.
We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?
Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.  We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There. Is that better? 
You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.
Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?
Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.
It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.
Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever! 
Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay! 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals;  where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.  But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!  And now, let's kick off our weeklong festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!  Let's hear it for these brave souls!  What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators! 
But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?
Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.
Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?
All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave.
Yes, you know, expire, end.  Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play. 
My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.
Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca.  You are truly South Park's finest. 
All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!  Let's go, people! There's no time to lose! 
Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. 
Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!!
Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!
Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell.
Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best.  And who's our little prize winner again?
God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-
Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.  Wait a minute... It's the snake! 
All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school.  Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral.
Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.
Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady! 
Having to do with a lake or ocean.
My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!
What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to lose, you idiot!
Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.
All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals!  This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary.
Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.
Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly. 
Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? 
Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?
We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but… 
Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!
Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. 
...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you. 
You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. 
This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year.
Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.
Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?
Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.
An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!
My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?
Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!
But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.
Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?
And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! 
You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!
Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa--  Oooooogh...
That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?
And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!
You can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1  All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.
Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!
Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!
Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman.  Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr. 
Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!
Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment.
