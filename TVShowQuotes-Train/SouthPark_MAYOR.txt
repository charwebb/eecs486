Oh, neato.

Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady! 

Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly. 

Oh, hell. Light the snake! 

Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful.

What?

Holy crap! He's alive??

Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!

Well, there's no going back now.  We're cannibals.  God save us.

Look out, he's got a gun! 

Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!

Oh, screw it. Jakov wins! 

Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there.

No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.

Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. 

All we know right now is that some of our children  are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?

Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.

Krocsyldiphithic.

An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!

Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best.  And who's our little prize winner again?

Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.

Thank you Chef! 

Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.

Ooooh!

Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.

Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.

What? Oh God!

I noticed! Call the National Guard!  Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch.  And to think I actually watched your HBO special.

What the hell is going on here?

How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?

Ooh, yes. How are you?

You do?

Come onn, come on!  Hello!

Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.

Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!

Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.

And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! 

You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?

All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals!  This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary.

We're all going to die in this horrible place. 

Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? 

My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.

Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.  Aw, hell..!

Closely attentive to details. Careful.

Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!

Oh, hell..! 

Here she comes. 

What... is that thing?

Just don't answer any more questions, got it?

Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?

Well, let's get back to it.

Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!

My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.

Oh.  Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia.

But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?

So when does it run out?!

Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play. 

I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.

Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school.  All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious."

The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene. 

O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.

Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!! 

Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name!

Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!

Children, as you all know, Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.

Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are.

Huh, what?

Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!

All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave.

Meugh. Send them in.

Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad. 

It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.

Oh, how sweet.

Ooh, Jesus. What a mess.

Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?! 

Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.

But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?

Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say "yippee."

My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.

Oh, boy.

Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!

All right, what's next.

Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.

Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.

Muhammad, would that be OK?

Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!

Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.

Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--

You are fired, buddy!

Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!

Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.

Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.

It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park. 

...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time...

Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa--  Oooooogh...

No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!

Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip

Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.  Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats! 

Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.

Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.

Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.

Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?

No, but look! He's got a little smile now!  See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think?  Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?

Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever! 

This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake.  I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call.  Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems!  Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smartass, I was being ironic..! 

Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?

Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.

You mean, Tina Yothers? 

You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!

Here she comes! 

You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!

Having to do with a lake or ocean.

Eric, your word is "chair."

The press is here.

You have?

What is fuck is that?!

Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?! 

Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?

Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. 

Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!!

Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.  Wait a minute... It's the snake! 

Where is she?

So I guess you wanna do some campaigning.  You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up...

Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals;  where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.  But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!  And now, let's kick off our weeklong festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!  Let's hear it for these brave souls!  What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators! 

Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!

Shh.

Well, how's the reading coming along?

Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.

Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show.

And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kaufman...

You can't leave.

Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!

Jakov, what is your name? 

Comanche helicopters...

Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?

Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?

And, that would be good? Alright?

All those opposed, say "nay."

That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?

We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?

What?

Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!

Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca.  You are truly South Park's finest. 

All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!  Let's go, people! There's no time to lose! 

What?!

Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?

This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?

Oh, come on, buck up, little fella.

Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious.

What?!

We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?

Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.

Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.  We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There. Is that better? 

Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do.

All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school.  Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral.

Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?

Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--

Oh, don't they look adorable?

It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.

Okay. Hands on your buzzers.

Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay! 

Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.

Correct!

Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.

English! 

Children are fickle.  All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.

Hmmm. 

Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell.

Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?

That's okay. Hands on buzzers.

Reward? What reward?

We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but… 

I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.

...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you. 

Well, you just can't let him die.

Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? 

Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!

Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?

Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?

They're Hollywood! They can do anything!

Something you sit on.

God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-

Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!

Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs!  Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France!  And, all one of you lucky constetants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?

...is your favorite celebrity, and mine  Kathie Lee Gifford! 

Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman.  Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr. 

Ugh!  Why, why Chef. What a surprise! 

My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?

What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to lose, you idiot!

Oh my God!

Well, quick, do something!

And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!

But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right? 

Fine. Then we'll sue you.  Johnson? 

You can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1  All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.

Oh brother, what now?!

People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...

Right over here. 

Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!

And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!

Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh.  Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.

Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day.  Let's have ice cream, everyone! 

Well, keep looking. 

Just send in the geometrist.

Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!

Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue? 

You have to wait until I ask the question first.

Buut, how do we decide "who"?

She's a cannon! 

Really??

Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!

Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!

Oh my God!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!

Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!

Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. 

Shut up!

Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!

Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.

Turn off the cameras!

We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone.

Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!
