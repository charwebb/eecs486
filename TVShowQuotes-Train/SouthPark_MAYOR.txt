Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?
Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.  We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There. Is that better? 
Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca.  You are truly South Park's finest. 
God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-
Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say "yippee."
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.
Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!! 
This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!
Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.
I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.
Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best.  And who's our little prize winner again?
All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals!  This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary.
Yes, you know, expire, end.  Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!
Oh.  Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia.
Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?
My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?
Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!
My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.
Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.
Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!
You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
Just don't answer any more questions, got it?
Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country.
It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park. 
What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to lose, you idiot!
We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?
This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year.
Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.
All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!  Let's go, people! There's no time to lose! 
Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?
Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?
Having to do with a lake or ocean.
Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady! 
Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.
Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip
You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals;  where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.  But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!  And now, let's kick off our weeklong festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!  Let's hear it for these brave souls!  What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators! 
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play. 
Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.
Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!
Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.
Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
Children, as you all know, Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.
This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake.  I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call.  Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems!  Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smartass, I was being ironic..! 
All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave.
But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?
People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...
How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?
My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.
Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!
The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene. 
Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!
Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!
And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! 
Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.  Wait a minute... It's the snake! 
Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!
Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.
But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right? 
Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? 
But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.
Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.
Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh.  Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.
Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!
It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. 
Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly. 
And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kaufman...
And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!
Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.
You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!
All we know right now is that some of our children  are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?
Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. 
Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do.
Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
We're all going to die in this horrible place. 
Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. 
Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!!
Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are.
Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell.
Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!
Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!
Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.
O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.
Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay! 
You have to wait until I ask the question first.
Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!
And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!
Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?
Oh my God!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!
Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?
An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!
Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?
Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever! 
We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?
Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!
Children are fickle.  All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.  Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats! 
Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? 
So I guess you wanna do some campaigning.  You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up...
Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. 
Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa--  Oooooogh...
This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.  Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag! 
Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.
Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but… 
You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!
No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs!  Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France!  And, all one of you lucky constetants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?
Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.
Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.  Aw, hell..!
Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school.  All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious."
Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like...
Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.
Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!
Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. 
I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.
...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you. 
My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
...is your favorite celebrity, and mine  Kathie Lee Gifford! 
No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!
Well, there's no going back now.  We're cannibals.  God save us.
It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.
Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!
All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school.  Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral.
