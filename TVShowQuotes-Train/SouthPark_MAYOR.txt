Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman.  Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr. 
Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!
Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school.  All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious."
Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?
Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. 
Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day.  Let's have ice cream, everyone! 
Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!
Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.
Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?
Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.
You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!
It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park. 
Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.
We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?
...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you. 
Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady! 
Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. 
No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!
Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!!
We're all going to die in this horrible place. 
No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
I noticed! Call the National Guard!  Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch.  And to think I actually watched your HBO special.
Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do.
Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!
Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!! 
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play. 
How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?
Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!
Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?
Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.
...is your favorite celebrity, and mine  Kathie Lee Gifford! 
Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.
But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.  Wait a minute... It's the snake! 
This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.  Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag! 
Well, there's no going back now.  We're cannibals.  God save us.
And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kaufman...
Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.
We know that after you see this darling short film,  you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?
Oh.  Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia.
All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals!  This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary.
Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? 
Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!
Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly. 
Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!
Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are.
Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best.  And who's our little prize winner again?
God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-
Yes, you know, expire, end.  Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.
Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh.  Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.
Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.
This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!
My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.  Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?
Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.
Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa--  Oooooogh...
You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!
Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?
Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.
Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip
What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on.  You're supposed to lose, you idiot!
Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay! 
Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.
Just don't answer any more questions, got it?
Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca.  You are truly South Park's finest. 
My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.
All we know right now is that some of our children  are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?
This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year.
Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. 
Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.
Having to do with a lake or ocean.
All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave.
An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!
Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!
It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.
Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.
Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.  Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats! 
Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!
Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!
But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right? 
Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?
Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!
Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.  Aw, hell..!
Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever! 
You can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1  All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.
Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.
You have to wait until I ask the question first.
Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!
That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?
The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene. 
Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?
Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!
Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. 
Oh my God!  You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!
Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say "yippee."
This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake.  I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call.  Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems!  Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smartass, I was being ironic..! 
No, but look! He's got a little smile now!  See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think?  Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?
You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!
Like Toto. And then the Harbuck's guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.
But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.
I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.
And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!
Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there.
So I guess you wanna do some campaigning.  You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up...
Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!
Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
Children, as you all know, Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.
Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?
Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like...
Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!
But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?
I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.
Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. 
It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country.
Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.
Children are fickle.  All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
Now we have Kyle Broflovski.  Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. 
Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.  We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There. Is that better? 
All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport!  Let's go, people! There's no time to lose!
