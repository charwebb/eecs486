Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
Hey um, I wanted to talk to you.  I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out.
I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
Can I please see you in my office, please?
Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?
Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?
Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Uh, nothing.  They're just out of Herr's chips.
Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
That's it? That's what you came up with?
And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.
Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?
So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
[recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
[moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?
So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir.
Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD]
[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]
Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that?
Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...
Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?
Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words?  No?
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him?
Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]
Do you want to get back together with her?
And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
And now we get to remember it forever.
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
[off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]
[Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?
Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam]
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
So do you want to see it or not?
Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.
That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
But don't worry about it.  My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
And then we're gonna go to the movies.
Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want.
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]
[whispering] Look how cute he is!  He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
