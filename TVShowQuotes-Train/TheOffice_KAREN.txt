Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
And now we get to remember it forever.
I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
Can I please see you in my office, please?
You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now?
[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?
Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
[off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
Do you want to get back together with her?
Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want.
We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.
Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]
Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
And then we're gonna go to the movies.
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.
That's it? That's what you came up with?
I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.
Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that?
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
[throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]
Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]
Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
[Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?
Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?
Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Uh, nothing.  They're just out of Herr's chips.
Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words?  No?
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
[moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out.
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?
Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.
Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
[with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty!
Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]
No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD]
Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
[whispering] Look how cute he is!  He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
So do you want to see it or not?
[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?
Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.
I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
But don't worry about it.  My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
