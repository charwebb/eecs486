Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?
OK.
Can I please see you in my office, please?
Hey.
Don't!  She's nuts! [they laugh]
[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Ok.
I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
[recording phone message] Karen Filippelli.
Oh, what happened?
Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.
Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?
Yeah, all day.
[squeaky chair] Hey.
That - it's the same thing.
His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
Good luck, Halpert.
Heh.
Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.
I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
Kay.
Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
Thanks.
Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun.
Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously.
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
Jim, hang on a second?
[at vending machine] Dammit.
[throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]
Thanks.
That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
You sure?
Oh. Did you shake it?
Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
...Almost done?
What are you doing here?
Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
Yeah, nothing there.
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
Yup.
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
Yep.
[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?
Good.
Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.
I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now?
Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
Got it.
[looking for Jim's sushi] Eel... eel.
Oooh.  Good-bye Michael.
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him?
Hey, so what's the status.
Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?
[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir.
Do you want to get back together with her?
Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.
Toby's not a salesperson.
You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words?  No?
As well.
Cause I'm going to get the job.
OK, OK. Um, cons.
I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
Umm, two hundred and one dollars.
Oh, you're kidding me?
And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
What are you sorry about?
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
That's three times in ten minutes.
Scared?
Thank you.
[laughing] Six?
You called me.
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
Okay.
Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky.
[recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
Thanks.
What's your funding?
Ah, of course.
[looks annoyed]
[whispering] Look how cute he is!  He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Thank you.
No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD]
Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
Oh my God!
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Michael...
How often do you come here?
This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
I think that's a really good option...
So um, well good.
Do it.
I think I owe you one.
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Hey.
Answer it.
Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that?
Yeah.
Uh, it's very insulting.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Hey dummy, get in the car!
...to knit.
So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
But don't worry about it.  My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
Yeah. P and R?
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].
So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?
If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?
No.
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
That's rude.
It's a strategy!
Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
Nope.
What?
All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
Mm.
C'mon, Jim!
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
Fifty-one.
Listen, I-
Get 'em big boy!
Yeah, thank you.
You ready Jim?
Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks.
My chair is squeaking.
Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
That is not healthy behavior.
Yeah, I'm okay, thanks.
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.
Rachel, your house is beautiful.
I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.
Cause of Jan again?
[moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
He would be disaster.
Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
What are the ingredients of poi?
Nice basket.
[confused] Oh. Okay.
It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
Yeah, we do a raffle...
Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.
Hey.
That's nice.
Karen Fillipelli.  Jim's girlfriend.
Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.
Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
But now we think you're a liar.
Thank you. [Both hug]
Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
This is not a proportionate response.
Right.
Do you like it?
Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
...and we're gonna go to dinner.
I'm taking Stanley.
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]
Hey, nice thermos.
[Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Yeah.
Hey Jan.
Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam]
Thanks. That was fun.
Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
Hey um, I wanted to talk to you.  I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.
What happened on your sales call?
Oh, uh, thanks.
Ooh.
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
You took my chair.
Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over.
It's a pretty common one.
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
Yeah.
Shouldn't we be equals?
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]
Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
Oh cool, yeah.
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
I know!
Hey.
See ya Pam.
Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
So do you want to see it or not?
Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
No that's, that is incredibly dangerous.
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.
Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
It's not good.
Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
Uh, what's that smell?
Hey. Hi, guys.
[whispering] Cut it out!
Oh, thank you.
I'm good.  Thanks.
[off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
What glare?
Goodnight, guys.
Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
You're kidding.
And then we're gonna go to the movies.
Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp.
Just tap S then D.
I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
I'm-
Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
What is going on?
Mr. Franklin?
Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic.
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
Hey.
Really?
Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
He's cute. You should date him.
Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
That would be fine.
Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
Uh no, I'm fine, thank you.
Hi.
Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.
[shrieks]
Yeah, you can't.
Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]
And now we get to remember it forever.
Hole?
Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?
Really?
What!
So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
This is going to be an adventure.
What you gonna do?
That's so great. That's great.
Let's just get this over with, shall we?
Um, shoot.  Uh, I will.  Sorry.
Uh, nothing.  They're just out of Herr's chips.
Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
A Christmas drinking game ...
I feel great, Kevin.  Thank you.
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
[on phone] Hello?
That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
Jesus.
And it didn't end well.
I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.
Wow!
I'm saying that you're being sexist.
So, let me ask you a question.
Andy, no acappella.
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out.
Hey I got one.
[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?
How's Jim?
Yeah, thanks.
Karen. I love your sweater.
Well,
Yeah.
Of course not!
Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?
[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
Uh, what are you doing here?
When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...
What are you sorry about?
Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]
