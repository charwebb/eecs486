Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.
I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...
Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam]
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]
Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words?  No?
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
[Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD]
So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
[moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out.
That's it? That's what you came up with?
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.
You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.
If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?
Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
Can I please see you in my office, please?
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]
Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.
Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?
Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?
Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that?
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]
That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him?
Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
[whispering] Look how cute he is!  He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
[recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Do you want to get back together with her?
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want.
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.
And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?
Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?
[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
Uh, nothing.  They're just out of Herr's chips.
But don't worry about it.  My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
Let's just get this over with, shall we?
Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.
But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
[throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]
Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now?
All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
So do you want to see it or not?
Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]
[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir.
