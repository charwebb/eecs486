What glare?
That is not healthy behavior.
Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words?  No?
Nope.
Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
Uh, nothing.  They're just out of Herr's chips.
Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that?
Pam is... kind of a bitch.
Just call me when you're done.
Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
C'mon, Jim!
Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].
Just tap S then D.
I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want.
Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
Ok.
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
Yeah.
That's nice.
Oh cool, yeah.
Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.
What is going on?
Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.
Um, shoot.  Uh, I will.  Sorry.
I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.
He would be disaster.
Hey.
Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
Uh no, I'm fine, thank you.
That's so great. That's great.
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
As well.
Goodnight, guys.
But now we think you're a liar.
[rocks in squeaky chair]
Uh, in about a month.
That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
Who's Bob Vance?
Yes. uh, huh.
Yeah, thanks.
And then we're gonna go to the movies.
I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
So do you want to see it or not?
What are you doing here?
So um, well good.
Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Hey.
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him?
How often do you come here?
Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
Oh, come on, guys. Please.
Really?
Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
[laughing] Yeah.
Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
[shrieks]
Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.
Toby's not a salesperson.
[whispering] Cut it out!
Can we just get back to work?
Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
Uh, what are you doing here?
Thank you. [Both hug]
[with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty!
What's your funding?
Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
Good luck, Halpert.
Oh, what happened?
It's a strategy!
No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
Get 'em big boy!
Umm, two hundred and one dollars.
[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
What are you sorry about?
Thank you.
Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.
Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
I moved here from Connecticut...
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
Hi.
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.
Yeah, we do a raffle...
Oh, uh, thanks.
Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
[recording phone message] Karen Filippelli.
Hey.
Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
What you gonna do?
Thanks. [looks suspicious]
Hey. Hi, guys.
[laughing] Six?
That would be fine.
Yeah, you can't.
Oh my God!
Shouldn't we be equals?
...to knit.
I feel great, Kevin.  Thank you.
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over.
Thanks.
[looking for Jim's sushi] Eel... eel.
Of course not!
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?
How are we going to get home?
Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
This is not a proportionate response.
Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky.
Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp.
Yeah, thank you.
Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]
[at vending machine] Dammit.
Karen Fillipelli.  Jim's girlfriend.
I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
A Christmas drinking game ...
Thank you.
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Rachel, your house is beautiful.
I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
No.
I'm-
Mm.
[throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]
I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.
[huffs]
Do you have a girlfriend?
Ooh.
Karen. I love your sweater.
That's rude.
Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
Oh, you're kidding me?
Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
Mm-hm.
You ready Jim?
Oh. Did you shake it?
Yeah.
So, let me ask you a question.
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
Michael...
Uh, it's very insulting.
That's it? That's what you came up with?
That - it's the same thing.
Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.
But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?
[off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
...Almost done?
[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?
Got it.
Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
Yeah, all day.
[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?
It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
I so got you.
[recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
Cause I'm going to get the job.
We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.
I'm saying that you're being sexist.
[whispering] Look how cute he is!  He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
No that's, that is incredibly dangerous.
OK, remember, be strong.
Yeah. P and R?
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, nice thermos.
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]
See ya Pam.
Listen, I-
[Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
Jesus.
Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.
[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]
Answer it.
Thanks.
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
What happened on your sales call?
Nice basket.
Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
Yeah?
I'm good.  Thanks.
This is going to be an adventure.
Heh.
I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.
What are the ingredients of poi?
I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.
Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
Yeah, you should not encourage him.
Hole?
Yup.
You took my chair.
A toaster.
So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
Hey dummy, get in the car!
[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir.
My chair is squeaking.
You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
What?
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
Ah, of course.
Wow!
Yeah.
Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
stop.
Thanks.
Yep.
I think I owe you one.
Hey, so what's the status.
Oooh.  Good-bye Michael.
Yeah, nothing there.
And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
How's Jim?
I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out.
Jim, hang on a second?
But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?
But don't worry about it.  My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
I think that's a really good option...
Okay.
Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously.
Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks.
Cause of Jan again?
[on phone] Hello?
And now we get to remember it forever.
Hey.
Kay.
What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
You're kidding.
Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]
What!
Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
Hey I got one.
Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun.
Yeah.
Really?
Well,
[moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
Don't!  She's nuts! [they laugh]
Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
...and we're gonna go to dinner.
That's three times in ten minutes.
You called me.
His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?
Fifty-one.
Andy, no acappella.
You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam]
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
OK.
Good.
And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
I know!
Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
Scared?
Yeah.
Do you want to get back together with her?
Uh, what's that smell?
I'm taking Stanley.
Let's just get this over with, shall we?
Let's go get a broom.
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?
Hey um, I wanted to talk to you.  I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.
If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
[looks annoyed]
Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?
[confused] Oh. Okay.
And it didn't end well.
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
