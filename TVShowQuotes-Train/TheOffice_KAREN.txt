OK.
He would be disaster.
Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
What are you sorry about?
Good luck, Halpert.
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]
Yeah, you should not encourage him.
Nice basket.
Ooh.
Hole?
Yeah?
Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
OK, OK. Um, cons.
No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD]
Kay.
Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
Uh, nothing.  They're just out of Herr's chips.
Hey.
So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Get 'em big boy!
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
Can we just get back to work?
Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.
His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
He's cute. You should date him.
Who's Bob Vance?
What!
[looking for Jim's sushi] Eel... eel.
Well,
Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.
Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky.
Scared?
Don't!  She's nuts! [they laugh]
Heh.
Do you want to get back together with her?
Yeah.
A Christmas drinking game ...
I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
So do you want to see it or not?
Ah, of course.
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks.
Hey I got one.
[shrieks]
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
What are the ingredients of poi?
Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?
That's rude.
Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?
Just call me when you're done.
If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
Andy, no acappella.
Uh no, I'm fine, thank you.
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
Jim?
Just tap S then D.
I'm-
Thanks.
See ya Pam.
Yup.
Yeah, nothing there.
Oh, you're kidding me?
Karen Fillipelli.  Jim's girlfriend.
It's a pretty common one.
[laughing] Yeah.
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
Hey.
Pam is... kind of a bitch.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
But now we think you're a liar.
Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.
And then we're gonna go to the movies.
Thanks.
Oh cool, yeah.
So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
Yeah, all day.
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him?
Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
Hey.
I know!
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.
Cause of Jan again?
Yeah, you can't.
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
Oh. Did you shake it?
Hey. Hi, guys.
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
Hey.
[recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Do you like it?
No that's, that is incredibly dangerous.
C'mon, Jim!
[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir.
Hey.
You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
It's not good.
Yep.
When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...
Yeah. P and R?
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
That's so great. That's great.
I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.
I so got you.
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
Thanks.
Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].
Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over.
[recording phone message] Karen Filippelli.
Do it.
What glare?
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
[whispering] Cut it out!
So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
[moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
Mr. Franklin?
OK, remember, be strong.
Umm, two hundred and one dollars.
Shouldn't we be equals?
Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?
I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
What you gonna do?
Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic.
And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words?  No?
I think that's a really good option...
I'm saying that you're being sexist.
[squeaky chair] Hey.
Oh, uh, thanks.
I'm good.  Thanks.
Oh my God!
Um, shoot.  Uh, I will.  Sorry.
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
So um, well good.
That would be fine.
You ready Jim?
[at vending machine] Dammit.
Oooh.  Good-bye Michael.
That's it? That's what you came up with?
Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
Right.
Listen, I-
This is going to be an adventure.
Mm-hm.
Cause I'm going to get the job.
Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.
Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
Of course not!
Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?
Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
[with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty!
Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that?
Rachel, your house is beautiful.
[on phone] Hello?
But don't worry about it.  My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
Hey, nice thermos.
So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
Toby's not a salesperson.
You called me.
Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.
Yeah.
Nope.
And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
So, let me ask you a question.
You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
...Almost done?
[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?
[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?
Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
[off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
A toaster.
Yeah, we do a raffle...
You're kidding.
I think I owe you one.
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
...to knit.
My chair is squeaking.
That - it's the same thing.
What?
Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp.
Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?
Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.
Answer it.
Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
Hey Jan.
Oh, come on, guys. Please.
All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
Thank you. [Both hug]
[rocks in squeaky chair]
Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
[whispering] Look how cute he is!  He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
That's three times in ten minutes.
Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
Yeah, thank you.
He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam]
This is not a proportionate response.
You sure?
Yeah, thanks.
[confused] Oh. Okay.
Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
Goodnight, guys.
That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
Michael...
What happened on your sales call?
Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.
Yeah.
Hey dummy, get in the car!
Jim, hang on a second?
I'm taking Stanley.
Yeah.
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
It's a strategy!
No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
Hey, so what's the status.
Karen. I love your sweater.
That is not healthy behavior.
I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want.
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
Really?
Thank you.
[huffs]
I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.
Let's go get a broom.
What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
What are you sorry about?
Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?
Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now?
[looks annoyed]
Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices]
Wow!
[laughing] Six?
Uh, it's very insulting.
...and we're gonna go to dinner.
Yes. uh, huh.
Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?
Thanks. That was fun.
Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
Hey um, I wanted to talk to you.  I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.
What is going on?
Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
How are we going to get home?
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.
Really?
I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun.
Uh, what's that smell?
Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
Hi.
That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
Okay.
We didn't have a party planning committee in Stamford. Somebody would just volunteer to run out to Carvel and pick up an ice cream cake. So the fact that they have a committee here, fascinating.
How's Jim?
Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
You took my chair.
What's your funding?
I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.
Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
Thanks. [looks suspicious]
Ok.
Thank you.
Can I please see you in my office, please?
[throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]
Let's just get this over with, shall we?
Mm.
It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
Oh.
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
