And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
[moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
Can I please see you in my office, please?
So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
[Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
Look, I've never seen a Clint Eastwood movie.
Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
[with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty!
I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
I am NOT a quitter.  I will do this all day if you want.
Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
Uh, nothing.  They're just out of Herr's chips.
So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head]
Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How's Scranton?
Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
Do you want to get back together with her?
This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.
Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
You didn't know that 'Bueller?' was from Ferris Bueller?
[throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade explosion, grins as Jim walks away]
[sighs] Do you still have feelings for her?
Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What?
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out.
I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.
Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
But don't worry about it.  My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
[recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
But if you said 'Go ahead, make my day,' I would know that it's from 'Dirty Harry'. How can you not know that's from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'?
I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That's great, that's so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
[her players gun is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words?  No?
If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
[sings] Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.
[lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
Hey um, I wanted to talk to you.  I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.
Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.
Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. [hugs pam]
That's it? That's what you came up with?
Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a 'for rent' sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
Oh, the vending machines!  How did we miss that?
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
[whispering] Look how cute he is!  He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement].
[spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them?
Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
[recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Well that you kissed.  And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal.  It's just a kiss.  Wait- you're not still interested in him?
I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
[Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift]
[Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo.
So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
[Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
Jim's nice enough.  I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  [makes classic 'Jim'-camera face] What is that?
You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...
Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.]
Let's just get this over with, shall we?
Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs]
Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
So do you want to see it or not?
Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
And then we're gonna go to the movies.
Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Wait, 'Amazing Race' like, the biggest sale wins?
[off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
[on phone] Bonjour.  Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's.  Non?  Ah... merci quand meme.  Au revoir.
Okay, great.  I think that's enough.  Can I get back to work now?
[recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
