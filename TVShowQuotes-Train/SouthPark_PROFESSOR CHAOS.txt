Uhget the Coon a Sprite, General Disarray.  As you can see we too have been working hard on Mysterion's identity.

Aaah, a m m Mysterion, I b-, I beg you, I mean ah, judahadahada...

Do you think I'm a fool?! All those times you stopped me from my acts of evil! All those times you tricked me into meeting you, and then ga- and then gave me titty-twisters! Not this time, Coon! I finally learned my lesson! Now, General Disarray!  Yeah-ha! 

Well, wait! I thought we were workin' together.  Waaa.  Oh jeez, I think I broke a tooth. 

I can't.

No, he's too fat. Based on his body type it's gotta be someone like Stan or Kyle. 

Hehyeah! We beat him, General Disarray! 

Oh yeah, I think it's around here somewhere. Uh, using our photos we are tryin' to pinpoint Mysterion's identity.

Oh I'm close. And I'll put an end to him, and all of you goody-two-shoe heroes!

Grandma? but how di-

Oh I'm sure you do. But you see I  whoop.  But you see I also know you like to beat me up.

Yeah, we did it!

Hey fellas?  Fellas, could you let me out please? It uh it's been like six days. 

Awww! Eewww!

Oh boy, General Disarray, muh maybe we just oughtta stay outta this one.

Ahh! Grandma! 

Aww jeez General Disarray, this is a lot more than I ever really intended.  I mean, well I hate the world and all its beauty and happiness and all but, but blowin' up a hospital? It just seems mean.  Whoa. Oh hamburgers!

Huhey, can I see the double rainbow, fellas?  Uh, fellas?

This way! We will now show you our secret headquarters of DOOM.

Waaugh!

Mark my words, South Park! Your precious hero is now, uh, your undoing! If Mysterion does not unmask himself publicly by Wednesday night, I am going to blow up... a hospital. Blow up a hospital?  I'm not gonna blow up any hospital. Are you nuts? What?  Uh, the choice is yours, Mysterion! Unmask yourself or hundreds will die! Hahaha.  Jesus Christ.

Let him go, General Disarray!  Why would you help us?!

Weh- oh yeah. 

Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now.  And I ain't got nothin' to eat.

O- oh careful General Disarray.

Uhhh ohhh...

No! Grandma please, nnnot Gummi bears!

But you both fight for justice and good.

But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been-

Okay sorry sorry! I'm sorry! I give up! Please, I give up!

Hey Coon w-we aren't actually gonna blo- blow up anything, are we?

Whowell I b- Well I b- ah I just would jes one nigh-, and then the Coon saw it up and I wa able to, and was able to
