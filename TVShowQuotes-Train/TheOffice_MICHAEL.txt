[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
You have stress?
I thought it might make me feel better.
I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
Pam!
I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.
Oh.
That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?
Just say you wanna get back together.
No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!
I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.
I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...
300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice.
Good, that is what's most important.
Pippity poppity.
You don't know what it is. [Laughs]
It's $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say? [no one makes a move to pay for the article]
Okay, all right, whatever.
I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
Hey.
I am dead inside.
So I'm not in trouble?
That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
Ok.
Hey, Jim. You got a hat?
Hey, girls. What's happening? Startinng to blend? Well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle.
About talking to the press?
I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you. [Pam and Jim begin wheeling him] Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
Yeah.
Oh!
Yes.
Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
[to Stanley, who is cracking up again] You were laughing right?
And he's a proctologist. [to teacher] What?
Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
Good morning.
Oh, really? Ok.
No, Baah! But he's married to her!
Oh, wow.
That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
Yes, so, no thank you.
[whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
Let's go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
[sighs] So how you holding up?
That's -- thanks.
Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
Oh, I bet.
A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
[on airplane] Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
Her boobs, definitely.
This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one. [Points to Phyllis]
Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  [whispers to Jim]  What's this about?
Radisson just gives out this vibe, 'Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson'.  It's kind of snooty.  So.
Any good headhunter knows I am available.
Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation...
He hasn't changed.
What do you want Dwight?
Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
Charles is going to tell you.
Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.
Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.
Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!
Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
Is that good?
No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?
Nope, nope, nope.
Yes.
That is worse.
Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
There's always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just nature's rule.  It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler.
No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.
Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy.
Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?
You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?
Are we both at the right place?
Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.
I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
Huh?
Sounds like a good dentist.
Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...
Business is like a jungle.  And I... am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  [smiling] Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head.  We don't have the technology.
No, no, no.
But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.
His name was Devon.
Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
[door opening] All right. Here you go, Princess. Just finished with part one.
Hi. Hi. Oh... [they hug]
Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
Oh God!
Fair enough.
You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.
As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
Okay, well.
I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question: do I do it as the man?  Does she do it as my superior?  I don't know.  That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.  It's, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me.  Hello?  Hi!  Just talking about you.  The camera?  No.  Uh huh.  How's traffic?  I miss you.  What.  Ok.  Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.  No. [to camera]  Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm.  No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have.  Right.  No.  Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people.  Only other people.  Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  [to Jan] I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.  I didn't slip you something!
Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.
What do you think?  What do you think of this place?
Thank you to our hosts.
Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Aaaaaaaa!
No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
Okay.
We'll do it quickly.
[sighs] What am I gong to do?  Uh... [chuckles].
What was that?
Okay, I'm calling the police.
Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?
[off camera] You just press the button.
[to Isabel] Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either.  Where are you sitting?  You need a seat buddy?
Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
I will allow it.
With us?
Si senor.
Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay.
Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
What you talking bout, Wallace? [imitating What you talking bout Willis]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.
Good. Here come the sharks. [they imitate jaws theme sounds and Dwight makes shark fin on his forehead]
Do you want me to find out what it says?
All right, all right, shh!
Please.
[filming video] Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not.
[seems taken aback] Uhm...
Yeah, I am.  I am.
This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.
Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
I want it...
All right, attention everyone.
Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?
Does his family know?
It's a deal.
Night Erin.
Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
Good work Pam.
All right. See you around.
I'm really sorry.
Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.
Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
I don't like that at all.
Mmhm!
You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
What do you like best about Pam?
Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
And now, the chains.
All right. We are infinitely sorry.
Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
Right what?
Ignorance.
Do you need 'em?
Yes they were.
[in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]
Hey, okay.
Keep the change. Here you go buddy, happy birthday.
Nobody should have to go to work thinking, 'Oh, this is the place that I might die today.'  That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.
Yeah.  Mmmmmm.
It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. [groans]
It's up to you to change his mind.
Oh the Anti-Christ!
Yeah, I'm busy right now. [hangs up]
Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being 'lured' these days. Thank you Dateline!
How about this one? It's Christmas eve---
To throw you off the scent.
Yes.
Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
You have no idea how high I can fly.
On whom's authority?
What are... What are you doing?
Are those all the other complains?
No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
Okay...
Okay, we're done! That's it.
It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
Yes.
No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they're really good.
Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to...
No.
I didn't do that. I... Maybe he called me.
Hey Pam.
That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.
You know what it means.
Yeah.
You should see the other guy.
I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]
By wanting it more. By working hard-
Yes, about that.
Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. [Michael dials phone number. Phone rings.]
By the bushes?
Hey, you know what?  I can't do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. [flails his arms]
How can I get you to stay?
Toby.
Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?
Toby, can I really tell you anything?
Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
Have a good night.
Irrelevant.
[Clears throat] I don't think I can sign this.
No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
One, two, three.. [all scream]
[talking over Jan] Yes, yes, yes.
I love Pad Thai.
Hey.
Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.
No?
Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.
You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...
How about never hundred hours, sir.
[Riding a bicycle down the hallway and singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. [Struggling to stay on] 'Tis the ... ack. [expletive] Hey! [to Pam] I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...
...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
No, you get outta here.
Oh how dare you.
Phyllis?  Could you take-.
I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
That's what she said.
Well done.
Goin'. Ok.  Where we goin'?  Doesn't matter.  Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.
Ah. [bows] Your eminence.
Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report]
Mmhm.
It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.
You're welcome.
What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch]
I will try to manage my excitement!
That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
Wikipedia.
[muttering] Can't you?  That's so nice.
Pam.
Yeah.
We're not hiring, Jim.
I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
I don't mind if I do.
Birdie. He's not the guy with the cheeks. Kenny G. Is... if you knew jazz, you'd know who I mean. Kenny G. God. Glad I remembered that. Jazz people know who he is.
Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle!
[smiling] Uh, yeah.
Hey!
So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
Did somebody order a hooker over here?
Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
That's fun.
Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...
I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
[clears throat] Stop it.
I have a job.
Oh, good. By yourself?
What did you think was going to happen?
[throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!
I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.
Just do a cartwheel!
Hello ladies, how's my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
OK, forget it.
Invite them on the tour.
Yes.
[sighs] Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.
Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it's you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can't say that I'm sorry. It's a relief.
I wasn't smiling that time and they can tell too.
Hello.
Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.
I do, yeah. Big plans.
Okay, what does that mean?
Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...
Umm, hmmm.
Uh... no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?
Wha - that's, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -
[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]
OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
A siesta!
Okay.
I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?
It's- that's different.
Got it right here. [pulls out Karnak turban]
You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.
You did?
You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
I appreciate that.
All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.
Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
The gabba-gool.
Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?
[in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
[laughing] I don't know what he's doing.
You look great too.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
Oh, I dunno about that.
Yeah, I hate that.
Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.
He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.
Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
[clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?
Number two, we go to the mall...
Lynn was as hot as Erin.
Heres the ring.
Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Well, at least you're still being honest with me.
...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
[Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping]
No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You'll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
I think you should do that. [Kelly starts fake-crying, then laughing, then she and Michael both laugh]
No it isn't.
Yeah, I noticed that.
Okay.  Where is my translator?
That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That's -
Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
[as Mikanos] Practice Olympics.
Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
The what now?
Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to 'Y'.
Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
[motioning to pad of paper with hangman game, spelling out  'S_an_ey is chea_in_ _n _eri] That and that are the same letter.
No, no, no!
Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
Keep simulating.
Nowhere.
Pro-Am.
There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
Okay.
OK!
Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
And you sent that out to everyone?
[yells] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [Jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up Michael's dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv] THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! [Jan goes upstairs crying.]
What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
Wow... that is insane! [laughter]
Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.
Everything here was made in China, Pam.
This is you. How much do you charge?
Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
Good work.
Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
That's what she sai [clears throat]  Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.
Thanks. Thanks so much. You think it was good?
Okay.
No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.
This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out]
Yeah, me too.
Our biggest worry.
Sorry about that.  What'd I miss?
I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around]
No. I'm not going to...
You're trying to trick me.
I got thirsty. How'd it go?
[to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?
Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and...
Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan]
We were more than we were.
You know, David.  I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
We are, we are a family.
I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back.
She's right on my way home from work.
Italians don't wear pockets.
When you know, you just know.
Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
What about Oscar?
Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley's monitor now] Let's give this a shot.
That is... who makes that?
No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber.
Oh my god. Was she cute?
Maybe!
Oh, hey. Thanks.
And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
And have a good elevator ride.
Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps]
Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.
There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.
If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!
Don't do what I say, say what I do.
[sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.
Yep.
No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...
Mmhm.
Uh, yes, I am.
Ohh. May I?
Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--
I also stole something off of her computer. A document called 'Dear Michael.'
What about the rest of you? [complete silence]
I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
Mmm, I'm telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food.  You know how they say 'stuff a cold'?  Well I don't care you've got, the flu, Lyme disease, emphysema, you eat an entire dark meat chicken, you can walk on the moon.
Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]
Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.
What?
[the limo driver raises the divider window] Who's playing with the button?
I... do not see you.
Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.
Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
Head table, where I belong.
You know what might be kind of fun?  I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and...
You know?
That���s what she said.
I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me. [Pam stares and nods]  Don't avoid this.  I know you're dying to say it, so just say it.
We're not fired?
Frien..sss...yes, you're friends with a hobbit, and... look where you live.  I mean, you've got it all.
We would have twins. [Dwight points towards the corner of his lip, indicating Michael's 'herpes']
On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
Okay, Ready?
Mmhmm, bravo!
Yeah that's fine.
Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness...' Open-mindedness, is that even a word? '...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.' [Laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that.
Shh shh shh shh.
I fell off the toilet.  I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
What?
Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. [cuts to Jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of Ravioli] A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [clue next to Jim reads: 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing [cut to scenes of chaos as everyone argues] Some people shouldn't be in this business.
That waitress was the one.
Morning, honey-pile.
Good, cut?
I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
No, no you're not going anywhere.  You're staying here until we figure this out.
[Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
Ohh, god.
Thank you.
Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.
God! He's a comedian.
...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!  Let's keep it moving!  Let's keep it moving!  Toby, everybody!
Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
Hm? Okay. Yep.
Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?
I didn't give you $40.
No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now.
Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let's go!
Thank God.
Thank you, Dwight.
---rolled into one.
[whispers] Okay.
[in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. [Meredtih sits Indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of Michael] Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
Yeah?
It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?
All right. What's the scoop, how far?
Here we go. This is gonna be good.
[sighs]  I wasn't talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?
[throwing away food from the fridge] Not today, Kevin.  Cannot be around carbs today.  You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?
I can't wait to be a father.  I'm going to smother that baby.
Top 80 percent!
No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea.
Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
[singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
You had a rough night tonight.  But your life is very good, my friend.  You've got a great job, you... you can have any woman you want, you're good looking, you, you know...
I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.
[honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied!
No, that's not how I meant it.
Up and over.
Ok.
You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... [mimicking Gabe] 'I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!' [normal voice] Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!
Okay. Pam, pros.
Hey.
I drove.
Watch this. Darryl, watch this.
I, uh... I am going to be a father.
BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
Many women
Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]
One. Two. Three.
You excited? About the new company?
What is Diwali?
I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?
No. Actually the trip sucked.
And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.'  And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
It's a deal.
Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]
Yep.
Do you have everything, guys?
Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.  [shrugs]
And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.
OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.
Alright!
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between 'A' gym and 'B' gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm. [period bell rings] Should we go?
Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
I don't know if I wanna do this.
Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in 'Raw,' and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in 'Daddy Daycare.' both great movies, but, still.
Okay, here's what we're going to do: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.
That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
So how you feeling about the new company?
Good!
I don't...
I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.
Good, good, good. I will see you.
Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.
...Stanley?
No.
Walk with me.
I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
Oh, these... all your kids?
Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!
Let's send up Accounting.
Yes, that's me. Come on it.
I might.
You looked freaked, man. We said 'Surprise.' You were, like, 'What?' 'What the hell's goin' on here?' Good cake. Why don't you have some?
Don't, don't.
Sure.
You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright.
So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't.
Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
Uh-huh.
Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.
I took a lot from other poems.
Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!
Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
Huh, okay.
Alright.
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud]
Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.
I tried, I tried.  I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail.  I feel like I'm dying inside.  I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II.  She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.  I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
Yeah, it's a business lunch.
[groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain.  Not literally.
As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.
All right.
[puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]
What? What? We did?
I don't.
Just cover up that bald patch.
Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.
Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
No. I think I will pass.
No this is Holly.
She would get this little foam mustache...
Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.
What?
And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It's Jan. What do I do?
Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
What are you doing?
Same sort of stuff in here.
Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
Ex-husband, you have to let it go.
What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
No.
Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
Come on!
[give Kevin his award]There you go.
You can go to hell. [laughs] I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
You are being too modest.
...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.
Pam, could I see you in my office?
You're right.
It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.
Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile.
Oh shhhh--oot!
Jimbo.
And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you'd be the weirdos.
Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...
Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!
Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
Ok.
No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.
It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
Totally your call babe.
[puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]
Pam, translate.
Ok.
Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
Wouldn't that be fun?
No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
Why?
All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.
I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
No, I gotta go. Text me later.
Okay.
How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?
I know, somebody will. And we'll wait.
Ok.
Oh, that sounds awful.
I won't.
It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.
Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don't cash that till Friday, OK?
Get 'em there.  Get 'em there.
Yeah? Who did you have?
Oh, anything bad?
Do you want an M&M?
TMI. Too much information. I used to say, 'Don't go there,' but that is so lame now. Or, 'You go, girl.' Or... Um, when did 'Where's the beef?' That was, like, a long, long time ago. It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, 'Too much information' probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently. Um, but you know, they're generally good for, like, no more than five or six years.
Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
Leave me al--
Just do your best! I have faith in you.
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes.
There's no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door]
Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I can't remember why I came over here. Ha, ha.
I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]
I want you to rub butter on my foot.
Thank you.
I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.
What is it?
David will always beat Goliath.
Stop the bus, okay?
And I will be taking questions.
Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn't much of a fight, actually.
Let's go.
Hmm.
Ok, yes. Sure.
Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
Yes, Andy.
I don't know if I can do that.  I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
I'm not...
Yes I do.
[talking to himself] I present the orientation video.
I know what you want to ask me. 'Did your mom ever see you naked?'
No.
No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
Pfffffttt.
With tolerance.
Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away]
Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
What?
How could she do this to me, Pam?
[in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough.
Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
Yes, good luck with that.
Just say the word.
Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?
Is it a good plan?
No, no, no!  Seriously, I don't mind sharing.
[talking quietly, trying not to move his lips]That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn't.  You're not a veterinarian.  You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]
[rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct?
Stanley!  What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! [Roy steals the ball, and goes for a lay up] Oh... Here we go! [Lonny shoots and makes it] Who's on him? Somebody get him!
No. Now, remember that honesty...
Oh.
Hello everyone!  As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.  [Applause] So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.  And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one.  This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever.  It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.  So I am instituting prima nocta.
The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
Yeah, sure.
Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.
So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.
Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
That's it?
I'm not sick! I'm burned!
Can you believe... cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper.
Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]
Do that. Do it.
Good trip down?
Oh...
Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
[to Dwight] Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
OK, yeah.
Well, he, Michael Scarn, that character, orders people around, and that's, you should of just gone-
What is that?
OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
I would like your undivided attention, please.
Really?
Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
If I could change the life of one person, just one person. I... Actually, that's shooting kind of low. I already did that when I was born. I changed two people's lives. Mom and Dad. Um, if I could change the lives of 5,000 people... 10,000. No, five. I'd be satisfied with 5,000. I... 10,000 though, that'd be something. Wow, 10,000 people. Because, you know what? Even one is amazing.
[reading the performance review] 'I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs.'
Take heed of.
Because I would kick his ass.
I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Na?
I'm braver than you?
Newspapers for sale!
Yep.
Of course.  Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.
What has gotten into you?
Oh -hoh! All right.
We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
Black tie optional.
Ohh, lunch party.
What's wrong with me?
Come on Stanley.  You're losing you.  You're losing you. Do it!
[behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning]
Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
Are we ready for the game?
I think you're great.  You're my best friend.
So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.
Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.
I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.
I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
Did you explain why?
Toby Flenderson, come on up here.
Or some tea or hummus or something?
Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
So it's not a free fall?
I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]
I am.
When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet.
Listen, Dwight.
Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.
My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]
Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.
Yeah! Toast!
It's from 'Sob-ray', our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me. [Erin tosses Michael open scissors, Pam is appalled]
Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
Okay. All right.
What?!
It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
[stands up] Anybody want any coffee or...
What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.
Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let's have happy times.
Would you like to help me with a special project?
Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight...
Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.
Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...
No.
[Stanley straining and breathing heavily] Oh, wow, that is adorable!
No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
There was no other guest the entire time I was here.
[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
I'm not following you.
Hmmm.
Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.
No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.
You know what. I think most basketball movies are great movies. Because it's a great subject. There's one about a little kid who, um, joins a professional basketball team and he's really, really good and he can dunk and he's like 3 feet tall. And he can dunk the ball. That, oh, I love that movie. That movie kind of, that movie makes me cry. I don't like to cry on camera, but that movie makes me cry. Um, because it touches a cord in me about hoops. [Michael's free throw is really short] Short, short, short! And basketball is like jazz, you know. To like pertipify it there's a jazz musician, a guy, you know... if you know jazz you know who I mean. He's uh, God what was his name? Um, he plays one of those curly horns, like those really shiny curly horns that's used in jazz a lot.
You are?
What?
[looks momentarily flattered, but thinks better of it] Kelly.
Uh, huh.
Intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch. That is all.
Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
[the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!
If you'll have me, yes.
Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys.
Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.
Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.
I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
Well, now suddenly he can see. [laughs] Okay, take off. See ya. Bye-bye. [gives coffee to Katy] There you go steaming hot cup of joe.
Hey hey!
Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
No...
All right.
Here... Who's here?
So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry.
[Phyllis scores] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score?
Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest.  It's all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And I'm treating Ryan the same way.
You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
I didn't get any agenda.
Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  I'm on it, don't worry.  So, how do I do that?
[clears his throat] So who is the godfather?
What for?
It's got a lot of me.
What?
I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. [Stanley enters the room] Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
Oh, nerd alert!
Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.
Hi.
[whistles poorly] Whoo.
Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
Stay [bleep] calm!
Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
This is bull[censored]!
To change lives.
Is that why your wearing makeup today?
Yes.
[opening a delivery envelope, takes out slice of pizza which appears to have a section off the end] Okay... don't ask me how I got it, let's just say that I have... connections. [folds it in two and takes a bite] Mmm.  Mmm.  [with a full mouth and an Italian accent] I'm the Godfather.  I'm gonna eat this whole pizza.  And then I'm gonna kill you. [digs around in envelope, pulls out the rest of the slice] [indistinct] some cheese.  You gotta fold it up.  That's the way you eat pizza.
Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay.
Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
No.
OK. No problem.
I do. She is.
I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
Okay, Ryan.
You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?
[sees Jan sizing up Holly] I'm fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
Come on.
She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
Where you from?
It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
Talk! Just talk!
Oh, OK! OK!
Pervert.
Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Who's a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
No, you said something, didn't you?
So what's going on? What I miss?
[to Brad coming out of the bathroom] Hey.
That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.
I can't say.
I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
Ahh come on!
I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. [Pam hugs Michael and gives him a quick peck on the cheek] Oh! Thank you.
Come on, let's go back to the party.
Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
Yes it is!
[laughing] OK.
Yes.
She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK.
...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.
I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.
Mm, that sounds great, actually.
You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.
Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
God.
Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.
Alright, alright.
Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.
Yes.
Okay.
Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
Mmm. No, you said you could man. We're counting on ya. You know you're playing point guard.
Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout.
Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.
Why... are you here?
Boom!  Freeze!  Michael Scoon, FBI.  You know what you did.  Boom! Boom! Boom! [shoots at Pregnant Girl and another actor]  Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you?  Didn't ya!?  Well, you didn't, because I know where ya hid the diamonds.  I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.  [another actor steps in]  Boom! Boom! Boom!
Don't whine.  Get the window. [Dwight exhales]
Stay, stay.
No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.
I used to be in HR.  I was a Hell raiser.
Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of... [makes yuck face at Erin]
All right.
That was Packer!  Oh, you're... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you.
...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!
Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.
[arriving at the first house] Alright let's go! [DeAngelo runs in the wrong direction] This way, this way! [Michael knocks on the door]
You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.
Yes we do.
No. There's no one else.
They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.
You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
No, no, title change only.
I gave it to you in the car.
How strange.  Because they always have yams.
That sounds pretty biased.
Keep simulating.
Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?
You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
[Knock at the door] Yeah.
All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!
Never.
Um.
Oh, God. Oh...
Why privately?
Do I need to speak up? [grabs boom microphone] Hello.
I was in that marriage arena, though.
[clears throat] What's the difference between Meredith and Michael Jackson? Michael Jackson's surgery was unnecessary.
Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
No, it's in like ten minutes.
Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
Open your mouth.
Exactly, were not...
Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?
Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?
Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
Alright, alright. [chanting continues]
Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.
I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
Yeah?
Hey.
I...
What kind of toppings would you like?
We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby.
No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
Gimme the bottle, Dwight!
Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...
Why do you lie, liar?
Sprinkles?
Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
One for me one for Jan.
Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [slap!]
Whatcha got?
Yes. Jim...
As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.
He's totally wrong, Pam. [to Justin] Hey.
But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
What's up?
No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.
No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
[exhales] Perfect, well, we're settled.
Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
Yeah.
Hello hello. Top of the morning to you!  Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! [Grabs and pours Kevin-esque scoop of M&Ms into his coat pocket] Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.
Okay! [Bob Vance and Michael in an all-out sprint, Michael grunting]
[from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is...
I'm right here, I'm right here.
Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin'?
I do not understand what you spend your money on.
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
Who?
All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
They are into appearance. We are selling success.
Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
Hey--
No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.
Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?
Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
Ok.
That's not...
Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.
How come you didn't get me one?
Blah-di-blah!
That is not what Wallace told us.
Okay. You can count on me.
No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
You know what. I, um, I'm out the door. I'm going to a meeting. Pam, I'm headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go.
He's the longest baby in this room.
Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents' divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.
Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
Yeah.  In all climates.  It's going to be worldwide.  And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That's where you come in.
Are we gonna do it?
[looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
Squarepants?
Okay, here we go.
Do you?
Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
We're all gonna have a good time tonight!
No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.
I was going to put that in my message, Toby. All right? So just cross it off. Cross it off, now. [Toby writes on birthday card] What are you doing? Oh come on, you're ruining it. Toby, come on.  Just, look at that. That's wrecked. Ass. Get some white out.
It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.
Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not.
I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
...poop my pants.
[sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
[whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
[Ten days later] Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
I've never framed a man before, have you?
Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.'
Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
Crisis Management Squad.
[off camera] That's terrible.
The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
Mmhm.
I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?
That was nice of you.
I'm going to get it.
I'll stay off the grid.
At all!
Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.
You can train him.  He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.
How can you give up my diary like that?
Oh, ok, that's, great.  No, I can't drive.  Jim why don't you drive.
OK, Hey, man, how's it going?
[bus stopping] Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you.
Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam.
Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...
Why don't you wanna go tonight?  What... all your friends are gonna be there.  It'll be fun.
Really?
How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
Alright.
Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
There you are.  I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.
Let's, yes?
So... high five me. We're back. To a happy... [grabs Holly's hand] look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Damn it Kevin, come on.
Yeah.
Ok.
You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
Yeah.
My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles.
I... Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal]
Well, could you condense it please?
Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for...
[imitating E.T.] Bummer.
Oh, you move on.
[to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes']
Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.
Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
I think it does.
Hey.
[muttering] I'm not saying... a damn thing.
Is it her boobs, or...
Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.
Yeah.
Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
Jo! We were not expecting you!
Oh, well, then, email it to me.
Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.
You know what? That's my foot.
Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
Oh, the Wall.
Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...
Surprise! [unveils bagels sitting on table] As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.
Oh, okay.
And the 'Tight Ass' award goes to Angela.  Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.  So...come on down.
Jerk. [walks off]
So no?
Who do you think it should be?
Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.
He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino.
My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?
Now hit me. [DeAngelo slaps him] One, two, three.
No, okay... I've had enough of you.
Is anyone still at the church?
I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
[reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'
Mm! [gives Jim a high five] Yeah!
Sure you don't want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem.
You did!
I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
Leave me alone, okay?
I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'...
Not gonna happen.
Dwight, you've hit a new low here.
No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball?
We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
And you guys are okay with this?
Oh, that's a good idea.
[putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]
This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.
No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.
Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--
No... She's in a coma.
She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
I'm going to give Erin $15.
Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
Well...
Yes.
Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...
All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent.
[misses a  free throw badly] I... I think you can play. Like you could when you were a kid. I think you can never give up the play. Because if people stop playing, then they stop living. It's like a shark. If a shark stops playing he stops living. And sharks are very playful creatures.
Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
I can't believe you're not going to be there.  It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man.
Detective Wallace?
Ok guys, you know what?  I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
Let's do.
Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.
Hey!
Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let's go.
So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
Yeah?
Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.
Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?
[reads email] 'I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.'
Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! [Luke points laser at Oscar's forehead] Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
Got it. It works.
That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
Your loss.
No, no. That is right now.
Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?!
Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]
Idiot.
No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
No, Dwight!  Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me.  You're gonna sit in the back left  where I don't have to see your ugly moongob.
I'm turning myself in right now!
It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, 'You're fired.' [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed.' It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed.'  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, 'You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want.' But that's unrealistic, so...
It's European, OK?  It's a European cut.
Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
Right.
Shhh.
[emerging from convenience store with two ice cream sundaes] Hey, look at that. Fun, right?
Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
Look at that.
Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
Mmm-hmm.
[singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again]
A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?
Yeah she probably, yeah she would be.  You know what, okay, excuse me.  Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music.  This is wrong, this is wrong!  This is wrong!  I have a girlfriend.  And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay.  Shame on you.  Go back to work!
Movie Monday!  The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
Steak! Where's my steeaaak?
[talking over Toby and Katy] Toby's divorced. God, that's hard. That really ripped you up. She got the kids right? That'll damage ya. Sorry man. That's uh, that's a bad one. How much you paying her? What can, you can't even afford anything now, right? You're all right though, right? Don't ask me for a raise. [laughs] Cup of Soup's a good idea though. That'll... that's a good budgetary thing to do.
An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
Yeah.
What?
Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.
[playing cat's cradle with Holly] Okay, am I grabbing this one?
Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
[laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.
To save time, Jim.
During our relaxation exercise?
Let's do it!
You are out of order.
I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
Hello, traitor.
Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval]
Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!
Ooh, someone's freakin'.
Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
[watching her eat] What?
Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.
[on the roof] My life!  Oh, my life...
I know, I know, we will wait.
Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
And this is, don't tell me, Martin... Ne... Ne...Nack.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?
This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
I can be very suprising.
It didn't come up organically.
Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
Not great.
It is.  I'm good.
Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
Oh yeah, you'd better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.  [kissing noise, kissing noise]  I love ya Pam... okay.  [singing]  I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow I'll be back.  I'll be back.  Tomorrow.  Um... yeah.  So you know what?  Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
Oh, time and resources.
If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
Shhh...
[laughs at the stupidity]
That's good.
It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.
So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?
Um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass.  Big butt, bigger heart. [knock on the door] I can't do this.
Hmmm, dare I? [laughs]  You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.  [walks to the annex, standing in Toby's cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby]
Why
And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
Whoop! Okay, what?
Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
It is six a.m. [DeAngelo yawns] and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
Let's celebrate.
Yes.
All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
I don't know.  Just felt like taking it off.  Man, work can be just so damn frustrating don't ya think, Jim?
Yes, well, of course. Of course. [laughing]
Hey hey, fellers.
Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
Yeah.
Oh, just went to the bathroom.
I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.
No.  Yes.
Alright, after you.
For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  I'm going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause I've got monies to move around.
Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]
Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.
Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people's lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
Those glasses are super dark.
Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
Well...
Saber.
Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there's prizes?
Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.
No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.
Yes.
She is pregnant. She is knocked up. 'K' Karen. Pam, let's go.
Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt]  Okay, sorry, let's, who else?  Oscar.
Oh...
Yeah.
That's not what you said earlier.
Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed! [hands him a lead]
That's not true.
[as Mikanos] I like the musical 'Grease', or as we call it, 'home'.
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
Just do it, okay?
[Dwight knocks on door] Yeah.
[listening to 'Crash Into Me' on his computer] Hmm... Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P...
I agree.
[Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.
No, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that's much harder to do.
Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
I do, too. I do, too.
No! You can't have any candy!
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?
I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
Yeah... I could.
Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear 'Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la.' No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
I want it to be like... 'Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?' 'Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous.' 'Well, guess what, [whispering] that was Michael Scott.'  'But it was anonymous, how do you know?' 'Because I'm him.'
Ok.
Dwight?
Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that.
What do you mean by 'these people'?
That is crooked on that side.
I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
Field Trip.
And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.
Per diem.
So, like a freedom tree.
Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed]
Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying 'Dunder Mifflin' at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
...empathy, respect... [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim!
Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
Just shut up!  I don't wanna hear anything more from you.
And what is that?
No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
See ya, drive safely.
No. We are not done here. This-
Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.
I don't know. Maybe.
Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.
It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear...
You don't have to say it like that.
Shut it.  Shut it.
That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.
I'm not, I'm not getting married. So... [laughs] Psych.
To watch tonight
Alright, that's...
Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?
Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
Oh God.
Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?
You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
I don't appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.
This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
Does David know this?
Dwight, I'm the boss.
But then she goes on to say 'that will be our only topic of discussion'.  That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.
Okay, let me try this one. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you?
Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
Sure.
[laughs] Yeah. That would be perfect.
Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.  [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser]
160
I don't know.  What?
I'm not a master bee.
I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.
Yeah.  Fine.
Wow! You did these... freehand?
Damn it. Come on.
Yeah. Go ahead.
Idiot.
I'm out of answers Jan.
My plan-- a man-- panama.
Of course, I did. I always... Yes, I do.
This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.
Is Oscar around?
Alright, I'm ready here.
Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.
...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
Good stuff.  All right.   Let's get down to some wine drinking.
We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.
Whoa!
[phone rings] Yeah?
We don't need luck.
[Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food?
I can't.
Really? You told on me. That's lame.
Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.
Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.
Pamela.
Did we get any mail?
[grunts]
Thank you.
This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.  [walking away]  Who else? [pointing] Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.
No. No. No.
Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Ummm... I don't know.
So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, 'Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?' And he looks at me and he says, 'Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.' And I look back at him and I say, 'I feel the need!... The need for tweed.'
Oh don't. That's disgusting.
Ahhhh!  [sweeps toys off his desk]
Toby, come on.  Let's go.
What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
[mouth full of brownie] Just stop it.  You haven't done anything helpful all day.
Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.
Write it down.
Okay.
[Strains, grunts] What?
He's hot, all right? What do you want me to do about it?
I'm starting my own paper company.
[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']
That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
Good, All right. Sounds great.
Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?
There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.
Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.
When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind. Was I well-loved? Check. Did I express myself? Did I let my light shine through? Check. Will an attractive woman cry at my funeral? Check. Probably more than one. Check. Check, check, check, check. Lastly, did I achieve success and own real estate? And when I close on this condo, I will be able to check that one as well.
I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. [singing] Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.
OK, let me be.
Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
You know what this is like?  I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I'm not in this for the trophies, but...
[cheers loudly after cast finishes singing song] That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
Or is it?
That was mean.
He didn't say.
[comes into Jim's office using accent] Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?
Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone [shakes head] but I won't do it.
Like the movie.
Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.
[pointing to group of young adults laughing] Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.
Okay, that might help. If you said 'I'm sorry' in front of everybody.
Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.
So much for keeping our secrets up high.
Flash cards.
That good?
Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?
Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
Ye - OK, yes.
The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming 'Opa!' Which means 'congratulations,' so...
You do?  How do you get in?
You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!
700
Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off]
Yeah.
All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?
OK...
[breathless] All right.  Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee]
You are disgusting.
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.
Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
Ok.
Okay.
Get the hell out of here, idiot.
[on phone] Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. [Sasha walks out] Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
[cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK.
Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist.
Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
That is a very good point, Dwight.
Alright.
It's nice to see you.
[on microphone] That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
[on the bus] Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
T! Yes! Yes! That is a 'T', and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there.
Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
No, I won't even consider it.
No, it said right, it said take a right.
In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure.
Here we go, let's sit down.
Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?
Uh...
Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
Okay.  It's going to be great.
Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? [looks into empty office]
I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings]
Whatever you guys did earlier.
I just don't want you to lie to me.  I don't want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?
I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
- and to King Meredith! [hands her a lead]
Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
What?
Yes, she is nuts.
Um, I...
I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
Okay.
Yes, your corner. Go.
Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
Oh, God. [Michael clears his throat]
Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.
Ok.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
... [whispers] It's a million-dollar sale.
Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking]
Really?
[hold up barrette] Well...
Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-
[laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on. Unless, of course, you're in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you. Good.
Wait. You forgetting something?
Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
Hey, hey...
Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
No, today at work.
I would love to take them all to Jamaica, but is that good management? Yes. But is it the best management? Well, I can't afford it, and corporate won't pay for it. So who's the real criminal?
[under his breath] Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now.
Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
I've been putting money into CDs for years.  I bought music that I didn't even like.  No. [shakes head]
I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?
Thought so too.
All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
[making the mouth on his tie talk]  Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs]  That's delicious!  I love it!
Thank you. You won't regret this, Michael.
Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
Yeppers.
I think you're over-thinking it.
[in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?
[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
I'm not listening to music!
With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.
And scene.
Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
[to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...
Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
Hi Santa.
Mm-Hmm.
Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.
I can't stop myself from kissing her.
Okay, can I have that?
Alright, here we go.
Okay.
You wearing a thong?
Yeah. [singing to music] 'Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you.' Here you go.
[laughs] Hahaha!... well...
I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
Kevin. You heard anything yet?
And I really really need to talk to David.
No no no no no no!
The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
Oh God, Rabies?
Oh... kay...
Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
Hey, if anybody wants to go...
[giddy] Yeah...
All right, shhh.  Dwight, leave him alone.
Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
Alright.  I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.
Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...
No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
No, it's not.
I am Beyonce always.
You'll break it.
Are you kidding me?  Oh!
Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]
I know, just sayin'.
There you go! Where's the other?
[in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
He's up there.'
OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.
This place is so cursed.
No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!
Good.
I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
There's a guy, there's a guy.
No. God. You go talk to him.
This is probably the icebreaker you need.
Dwight?
Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
Nn--- Depression.
I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...
Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
We're havin a little brainstorm session...
No this is Holly.
Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
One other thing I wanted to...
Well, okay...
No, we can't.
Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.]
Yeah, a little bit.
Stay or...
Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on ...
Would she get into trouble?
Yes I do.
Hello.
I almost worked there.
Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.
I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?
Oh, wow! What did you do?
Oh, hey.
No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.
I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
A couple of years ago, I went to one in Hartford. 'Connecticut.' And Todd Packer and I went to this bar and met a girl. And [laugh] Packer decides to make out with her. Turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar. [laugh] I love this. The bouncer chases us out to Packer's Vette, jump in the Vette, he
You can't always work 200 days though.
Funk is the problem and the solution.
...for Phone. What?
Okay, well---
I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
No.
[wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What's so funny?
Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much.
There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck].
Wait.
Then I'll give you away!
David Wallace told me!!
No, you shut up.
[in the limo with Dwight, Andy and Oscar] I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.
I'll get it.
It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
Woo hoo.
[doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
Jackson Five.
[into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please?
Line.
Could have gone better I guess.
No, No.
No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
Ah, great. No further questions.
Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
Oh, my God, Dwight.
Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!
No? Um... Check your spam folder.
[imitating] You ahh.
I need to pee.
Well...
[on phone] So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring.  Very good, nice doing business with you.  Thank you. [hangs up] Yes! [chuckles] Oh, yeah!  Read it and weep.  Oh!  Oh, look at that! [puts post-it on Phyllis' forehead]  Look at me, Phyllis!  Oh, what is that?  That's my sale! [humming then dancing victoriously]
Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon...
Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
That is a good point.
It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
That's what she said.
You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
You know what we should do?
Wow!
Tube City, you owe me one.
Could he help us with some parking tickets?
Hey, nice to meet you.
OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It's like another seven hours.
Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. [Erin tosses open scissors across Jim and Pam]
Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
So, let us consider this matter ended.
If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.
OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]
Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...
Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?
This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---
All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
[over phone] I love you! [laughs]
We already have a buyer.
Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
How ya doin'?
13 hot dogs, everybody!
Do the boobs!
Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
Are you sure?
I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone.
You're 54 years old.
[pulls a brand new mug out of his desk door] That won't be necessary.
But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!
So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid.
Ye-ohh.  Ye-no.
I could manage my way around that.
Yes.
Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
Uh, okay.
So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so...
That was really fun last night.
Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.
Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?
I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
[smiles, sighs, chuckles] Okay.
[Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think?
Nailed it.  Nailed it!  Come here.
Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone]
Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
Oh, really?
The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  You're just a name and number and no one even says hello.' [to Ryan] Card!
No, I don't want to wear a bra.
Yeah?
What? I told them busiest...idiots.
[fake kicks in door] Boom! Detective Michael Scarn.  I'm with the FBI.
I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
Arrr, dooby dooby do. 'You need to do something about your B.O.'
Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.
[on the phone] Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I'm glad it timed out that way.
Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
But, you will not tell anyone.
No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. [walks into bedroom, Jan sleeping on bed] This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. [sighs] She probably won't be up for a few hours.
Yes.  Okay, let's do another one.  This is a good one.  'A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---'
Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. [as Robin Williams] 'That's Good morning, Vietnam!' Well, hello to you. You know it would be... God. And you know what, sometimes when I'm watching somebody like um, like Jay Leno. He'll be half way through his step [snaps his fingers] And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.' And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other... You know it's like uh, you know Leno, um and Letterman, Carson, you know. Need I say more? No.
This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.
Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. [to Jan] Come on. Let's go in.
High five! [Borat voice]
[barges in] Hi.
Yes.
[playing Jan's message] 'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.
[clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...
Oh... That's gonna change. [laughing]
Car starting. [makes car sounds]  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
Indubitably.
Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
I know, I know.
One more time. [singing] You...
God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
Yes you are.  Oh, buckle up Jim.
Oh really?
She'll be sitting home saying, 'Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons.'  [Dwight laughs] 'And... and clip my toenails.'
I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
Where you going?
All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
Yes, it was that. It's that one.
[in conference room] Here... [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]
Fine, have your clients.  I can see that's what you wanted all along.  [everyone mutters 'okay'] However, I rescind my apology.
Yes.
You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
I'm trying!
Hey guys.
Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided. [elevator bell dings] Wow, that's  a fast elevator.
No. She's an alternate.
Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.
Give me the phone.
This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
[looking afraid] You can count on me.
Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
[in video] He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.
[entering the elevator] Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!
Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
You can't be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.
We make a poster that says 'Happy Opposite Day!' and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'
But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.
Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
It's nice to see you doing so well.
Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?
This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.
Obviously.
Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!
[Michael finally breaks] Take it back.
[sitting at Jim's desk]  Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.
Dunder Mifflin.
Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
Yup.
Nope, no. Guests only.
Wow.
[laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
Uh...
[whispering to Meredith] Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.
Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car]
Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.
What do you say?
Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?
Why... why are you making this so hard?
Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
What's the matter?
Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.
Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm...
I don't know. I think so.
Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says 'Creed.'
Because I wanted you to come to me and say, 'Wow, he is so great.' And I was gonna say, 'Well, it's in the genes.' And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
So, when, um, can I see you again?
Busted.
[Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan's attention] Pick up.
What?
Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.
You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.
Okay.
I know, it's...
Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---
And many more!
[moves chair to Jim and Dwight's desks] Ooo, bleh bleh bleh.
Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.
That's funny.
Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
You...
Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.
What do we got?
No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.
Nothing. Let's just... all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use?
Uh, just never happened.
Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five. [Michael and Ryan high five] Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. [camera cuts to Pam then back to Michael] Now, who was the one before Curly?
Uh, what flavor?
Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.
Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
Mmhmm.
Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
Mom, I'm getting married.
Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.
Thank you, Jim is with me.
No!
Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
Snowboarding?
You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some...  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.
Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!
BFD. Engaged ain't married.
Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael's office]
Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.
Ah.
Hi Dwight.
Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...
I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
[quietly shuts the door] Go.
I don't have a second job.  Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right.
Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
Sure it is.
If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
He will be ushering you out.  [starts laughing]
Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. [reveals a tiny TV] I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? [moves TV back a couple inches] Voila, right in the wall.
Hi.
Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.
It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]
So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.
[sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
Yes.
Got them on their feet.
I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.
[phone rings] Yes
Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!
I'm just saying, that -
Happy Halloween, everyone! [notices Pam, in her cat costume] Oh... that's great!
Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
No. Hey... I mean, although it's just for fun, you know we want... I was counting on you man.
Well what am I supposed to do?
Oh, thank you.
Yeah?
[coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening!
Holly. Hey.
[amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?
I am jetting off on an international business trip.
Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
[laughs, looks to camera excitedly]
Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
Welcome to your future.
Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]
[putting his feet on desk] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen.
Morning everyone.  Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.
Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
You too?
Good, so, we're on the same page?
All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
I'm not playing.
All right.
I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you're still sick.  So have a great long weekend.
Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?
Do some research.  Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.
Temporary workspace. You can use it.
OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
We go to the bed store, I let her choose whatever bed she wants...
As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
Well, we are running a business, so.
Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.
[in video] The Dundie award for 'Longest Engagement' goes to Pam Beesley.
Jimbo, let's do this thang.
Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. [makes a gasping sound]
Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
Yeah.
Oh, hey what is this?
What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Dwight!
Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
You were surprised, weren't you?
Uh. Dwight.
Yeah, you took it too slow.
When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.
A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says 'Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?' This is what's at stake.
Yeah, I get those every day after work.
I need clean urine for the lady.
That's a nice tie.
Well, why don't-
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
All right. This is gonna be good.
Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
Yep, get it.
I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.
Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?
I'm good. Oh, my God.
Just go out, and come back in.
[sigh] I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.
I'm sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
That's... Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there. [Dwight digs hole in ground] Just dig.
So we're good?
That's perfect.
Dwight, find out what the present is.
We already have that. So...
Okay.
Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.
Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
[stopping Manager] DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
[approaching Kelly's desk, whispering] Stanley is having an affir.
You're close with Pam too.
Get in the back please.
I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
All righty then, well I see you're going for the whole bored supermodel thing. 'Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?' [takes a drag from an imaginary cigarette] Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
Yes I do.
Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] 'You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!'
We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
Well, that...
No, Really?
Oh.
Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
I know. So who's next?
You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
Fine. Fine.
You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, 'Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?' 'High-five, Donna.' 'Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?' 'Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit.'
Oh! What's our receptionists name?
Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?
Oh!
Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, 'I am so lame.' Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like... [imitating jackhammer] You know what I'm talking about?
To tell you or not.  And I'm glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
[to everyone] Well here we are... I would just like to...
Okay.
I'm just having a little exit interview.
Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
Well, that is not gonna happen!
Why are you dressed like that?
Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
Yeah.
You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
Just don't, don't talk-
OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
Nope, nope.  I actually wear a turban sometimes.  Wanna see it?
Bail'er?  I hardly know her.
You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
He sounds like a nice guy.
Yes.
Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.
Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management. [takes deep breath] Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today... And you don't worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... And there are no roofs in coal mines.
Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!
I have two sure things, one wildcard.
Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
Good morning.
You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these [giving Toby two middle fingers] and call me in the morning.
Are we ready?
It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.
I don't know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.
Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What's the... oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?
[sings] ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
[singing] But it just may be a lunatic... [stops singing] No.
It is a colonoscopy.
Here we go.
Geesh, Dwight!
Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
No.
Yes.  My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation.  Very, very excited.  He is my protege.  He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured.  Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk.  And now he is also my boss.  So, win/win.
Thank you.
That's adorable.
It's drying, it's drying...
You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
Yeah... ugh. She's... [gets up and leaves] you don't deserve her. Alright.
I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...
Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
Very good.
OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]
Bye.
Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.
Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
It's alright. I can handle it.
She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
Hey, have you seen Jim?
Well, then he's not a senator.
Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...
I color code all my info. I wrote 'gay son' in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means 'Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?' Most colors mean 'Don't say it.'
Okay, just summarize.
So my looks have nothing to do with it?
Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone!
Blackula!
Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. 'Michael, buy a motorcycle.' So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.
[looks at Oscar who is using his phone, grabs it] Well, well, well.  What is this contraption, I do declare?
And he was laughing.
Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
What about a raise based on merit?
All right, let's start.
Hey
Mm, no...
They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
Let me get your stroller.
She drives a green camry.
Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
Can I just stay here and never go back?
No.
No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
I am.  I'm definitely going to do it.  I've already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?
I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
What?
Are we going?  [Dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown] Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready.
This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out?
You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.
Were you listening to what I was saying?
Well, okay, lets go.
How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?
Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.
Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.
Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
Okay, well, I made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out, in case you're ever tempted. So there you go. And, Dwight, you know, I'm very busy today. It wasn't even planning on going to the bathroom, so I don't even know if anything will come out.
It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...
So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
Monkey pee all over you.
[looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here?
It's your delivery...
Well, can't Alan protect you?
The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.
Let's go, come on. [whispers] God!
Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.
Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.
No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going.
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
Why not?
[walks over to Kelly] Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.
Okay.
God, this is so disgusting.
No it's okay, we're talking code.
I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, 'I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.' Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball.
[exhales] That's true.
Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
What?
Yeah, why don't you do that?
No, I'm kidding.  No, you're not--you're not fired.  Yet.
Stop it! Stop it!
Could I stick it with a pin?
We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael's office] don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.
...the 'Busiest Beaver' award goes to Phyllis Lapin.
Yeah, I will.
I'm pretty much devastated.
Erin?
I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
Coffee Jim.
I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.
Wow.  That just-- you've really grown.
I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
Thanks. [to Andy] Andy?
All right.
Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Okay.
I...
How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.
Our company is worth nothing.  That's the difference between you and I.  Business isn't about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.
For Holly.
I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi...  It's called Reginald Pooftah.
Oh, every man's dream.
No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.
What?
I'm a little busy right now.  Could you BlackBerry me a message?
What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.
Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. [reveals hidden broccoli, spits it out] Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.
We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
I don't think you froze.
[getting his spirit back] Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
Dar de dar.
Are you kidding me?
Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!
Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
Ryan?
Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se.
Yeah.
What? Really?
Wow, you're kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?
Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.
Oh, yeah.
Really?
No!  Oh my God!
Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
I don't know what the [expletive] that was.
Dwight! Dwight!
What's up spinsters?
[talking to the speakerphone] Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?
No!
[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that's right.  It's a baby, see?
No.
Okay.
Inventory's at the end of December.
Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
[to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
I love him.
God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting]
You don't have one single girlfriend?
Fine.
That's from Superman?
Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...
Really?
Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
How is that funny?
Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]
Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
That's a shawl.
Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
What did I say?
[sighs] Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?
Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
That was helping. It was classic.
Okay, here we go.
No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Hello!
Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking]
She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.
Um...
Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.
What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
Goodnight!
Yes.
You should... floss.
Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
We have nowhere else Jan. This...
Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.
It's okay.
Yeah, the Commish.
No. No! Are you sure?
Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
Huh.
[Darryl scores] Watch the long passes, you guys!
Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!
What, huh?
Don't!
Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave]
Shut up!
Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael's office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.
The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...
No, no, no.
How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?
Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre. [mispronounced 'sob-ray']  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.  Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses.
Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak.
That's good. He's throwing it.
Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.
Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.
Potential, lots of potential. yes.
OK. Cool, you're on. [to Dwight] Don't screw this up.
Twice. ... Right?
Good, we're all here, we can get started.
Congratulations.
Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
Regional manager.
50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
This is it, check that out, can you smell that? [the room is filled with candles that say 'Serenity by Jan']
And, um, one down.  Next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression'.  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression.
Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
I have my passport. [pats jacket pocket]
Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
Alright!
Yes, right in here, come on in.
Is the cool new guy Charles?
[laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!
Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.
Ach, [to Darryl quietly] okay, okay, play the cutoff music.
Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.
N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.
You, you like that?
Uh, yes. Thank you for noticing.
Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.
[opens present] 'In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.'
Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
Oh, that's not appropriate.
You guys! Yes! Yes!
Guh.
...come on, Jan!
Andy's afwaid?
Okay.
[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can't help but feel partially responsible.
See ya.
Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. 'Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority.' Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
Are you kidding me?
Don't bother Luke.
Oh, no, no, no...
But it's cool, and it's-
Introduce yourself. Be polite.
A week? A month? A year?
[to Jim] To be married?
[under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!
Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
She can't talk to us that way.
I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
We already have a sofa. So why do---
I'm not gonna lock my door.  [door closes. Then clicks locked]
Bye.
I am already walking.
Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
Alright.
Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.
I know.
[to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
I have no idea.
Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?
Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, 'Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.' Makes you feel good.
I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.
David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as.
You know what?  Actually, let's go into the conference room.
That's sorta secondary. [offers Jim the watch again]
Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
We have a monthly staff meeting
I'm trying!
Oh.  [laughs and claps] Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!
What does what mean?
Hi, is it over?
Okay.  ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
These are our demands.
I'm not gonna answer it
Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!
I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
[in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson.
Bruuuuuuuuuce.
Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
[gets up and begins to walk out of the room]
Ohhh, no.
May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
All right.
All right!
No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
[sighs, walks back into office]
Is that all you have on her?
Coulda sworn there was...
Are you mental?
Turn around, turn around. Come on. [making a body turning gesture]
Let's go in here.
Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...
Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.
[panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?
Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]
I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so...
Do you remember what color my eyes are?
The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
Hello.
Who's that? Who's that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures]
Oh, hey guys.
Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.
Previously on Varsity Blues...
Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?
Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
Seven deadly sins. It's a sign.
Yes.
Oscar, what were you going to say?
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
Don't...' Okay, that's blank. Don't. Just...
Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?
Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
[walks over to Erin's desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.
Nope.
I'll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri.
Hey!
Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!
Yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on Pam.
Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays] Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. [music stops] And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. [clears throat] Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays]
No, that's not it.
Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.
Just get in the car.
Let's hear it.
Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.
Hello.
There we go. Our town car awaits.
Why?  Wha...
I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
We didn't break up.
[during curtain call for Sweeney Todd] Boo! Boo!
I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.
What do you need?
Don't... is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.
Just do it.
Oh really?
She sits there all day.
[on phone] Yes.
Snack attack time.
Eight months?
Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
[clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This...
I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
No, whomever is never actually right.
Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
So close. So close.
Carroll, how are you?
You guys ever protect the president?
I would love that.
And I want Charles gone.
Burned my foot, Pam.
What?
Like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look. Okay, we're done. Is that your stomach? I keep hearing somebody's stomach. [whispers] God.
Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it
Best friends.
I have an idea.  Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
Ahhh... Ho ho ho! [struggles to pull Ryan towards him] Come on I need this. Come over here!
Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please.  Very rude.  You're ruining the party.
Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.
Sexual time bomb.
I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, ' This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.' [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.
Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
IHop.
Why?
Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I'm just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.
Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
What are you reading?
I thought you had to pee.
We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.
Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
All right. Good. Thank you. [Andy picks a card] Do not look at your card. Now, I've always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here [puts hand over heart]. So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.
Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
I know, it's unbelievable.
Okay, I got it.
[sighs]...okay.
The machine knows where it is going!
Hi, Carol. How you doing?
OK. Do you want me to repeat that?
Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  [to Katy] So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?
This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.
Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
[whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
I can't go back to that.
There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde. [laughs]
Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
Ok, let me ask you this.
Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
You don't. No, no.
No, I am, it's all about the personality, Jim.
Oh, OK.  Why didn't you call me?
These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.
Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!
Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
No, that can't be right.
Yes.
Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?
Hello.
I...
That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.
Did you have a good weekend going there?
When I was Ryan's age, I worked at Arby's and then I worked selling cutlery for a while. Cutlery that could decimate a penny, I kid you not. There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny. So I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn't, and will never have.
Ah, why, that's great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.
Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.
Cause that's...
[gasps] I do! Hey, come on!
Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
[holds up a camera and DeAngelo meows] Here we go! Have Pam come down.
So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?
Okay... [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.
Seriously. No, really.
Yeah, I figured that.
And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir...
Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
No, you--no.
That's it? You're going to end with 'etcetera'? Okay, what's this big organizational system that...
Yes.
Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.
I don't know.
[concerned] Why?
Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
Doesn't matter.  Out please!
You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
They were.
[coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils.
[to Jim] Who's there?
I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
Will they throw their hats, you think?
No.
How's the lady situation?
Yes. Actually, I have. I have been on a hunting trip. I shot a deer in the leg. I had to... I had to hit him, I had to hit him with a shovel for about an hour, so he... That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask?
Who's the boy toy?
Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
[accent] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here's Savannah.
Whass...up!
[on phone] What's it... why are you crying?
Absolutely. Is this mine or is this Chili's?
Yeah, he is that good-looking.
I want you to bring a partner.
I love that. I love that face.
That's... they always give an ultimatum.
[holds out arms to Pam]
[scoffs] When have you ever done that?
Dwight, get the door.
Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn't hired.
Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.
Yes.
I just got back from vacay. Come on. Give me a break, man. [holds up CD] Waves over Jamaica, $6.99.
Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
I don't wanna talk about it.  I just wanna hang out, just be one of the guys.
Foul! Foul!
Nobody likes beets.
How much? How many pounds is it?
Six percent?  After all we've been through?
A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is 'Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.'
No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely.
I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. [rings doorbell] He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? [loud drumming as door opens] Hey. Hi, sorry.
Let's get back to the matter at hand.
Nice to meet you too.
Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.
No you would not.
Oh, you wanna go today?
Pretty good.
Good.
Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one. [quietly to Jim] I didn't really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious. [picks up amuse-bouche tray]
Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
[on video] ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...
Great.
You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].
Ow! [grunts, stumbles to his feet] You never forget. Whoo!
No, I don't.
Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?
Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? 'Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.
Sign the papers at the condo.
No, you may not.
Never missed a day, my ass.
Thanks. [grins]
So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?
Really?
You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
Oh.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I'm a big believer in people being here more.
[pained] Mpfh.
Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
[Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort?   [on phone] Hey boo!
Ho-oh!
You heard me, pack your things.
What the hell is going on here?!
I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
Right.
Oh, come on. Come on.
[shakes head, annoyed] I don't know.
That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.
Okay. [sits back down to continue eating]
Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
I don't know.
That's crazy.  That's crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got? [checks watch] You know what?  That's a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Who's to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, let's give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.
Alright.
Alright who's next?  Where's Andy?
No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.
[waving to Christian]  See ya.
Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.
Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
Not it. I don't have eggs.
Whoa!
[mumbling] Should I... turn, no. Do it again.
Well...
No, no, no.
All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
Dwight, I asked him.
Ok, you know what?  You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door]
[under his breath] Um... kay. Uh, alright.
Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!
Yeah.
Life-size.
Sure.
[in Jim's office] How you doing?
[shakes head] Okay...
No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]
On a Friday? [Dwight nods]
Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
You, too, Dwight?
OK.
Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
Divorce. Um... Okay, 'Meredith is so old...'
And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.
Yes.
That's it!
Give me the phone.
[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
[escorts Erin off stage] There you go.
No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
[muffled] That's what she said.
When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.
Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying 'He's talking about you!']
You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
Well I hope I make it.
No, I will.
Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! [on phone] This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! [hangs up] Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
Wait, wait. Check one more time.
Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...
You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
[Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here.
Could we get a Delorean?
Oh God, what was that?
Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
How you doing stud? You already there?
Well that is all in the past.
[on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done.
Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
Chili's is great.
I know, I know, I know.
I've put having a family on hold.
Just - sh -
Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.
Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.
I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
I know.
You are doing it.
I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
Nice to meet you.
Yes, it is.
I'm a little confused.  'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy.  And then it's like all regret.  Because 'Oh, I regret that.'  But, 'Wait, I'm still gonna call you.'  But, but, 'We're just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job.'  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.
I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
All right.
[imitating E.T.] E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
Come on out!
I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit.  I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go.  Feeling good.  Listen to some tunes.  Should've peed before I left.
If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
Mm-hmm.
See you.
You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.
Oh...
It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
You're actually talking a lot.
Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest.
Should've had hindsight.
Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
Son of a bitch.
If she is, it's working.
They have one of those?
Well, you said I looked thin, so what does... Does that mean I'm like thin weird or thin handsome or... [laughing]
It's Grotti. He's following up.
It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
[from inside the restroom] Stanley?
What do you like Pam?
It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
Not yet!
This is all we need.
No, you shut up.  They need this game, Jim.  Let us have this stupid little game, alright? [Jim nods]
[Jim makes a shot after pushing off Roy] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.
And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever. [clip montage]
Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
Because he's mean.  He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is...
You mean cancer?
Hi. What is the name of our town?
Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
[scats awkwardly] There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
Thanks.
Ugh, what?
Yes pleeeeease!  Thank yooouuu!
Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! [dressed as Santa]
His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off. I'm sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.
So you don't want to end our relationship?
Woo hoo, shout out!
That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.
Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'
Sorry I was a jerk.
Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
Okay get off, get off! [pushes Kevin off] Oh! Oh, God!
Hey hey.
Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
Why did you just say he was the boss?
[on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
Hey, Justin!
[as Elvis] You're welcome, baby.
Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
Okay.  You can't smoke anywhere these days.
Good night Vikram.
Eric likes Megan.
I'm going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.
What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time]
We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]
Look who you're talking to.
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.
A surveillance room next to this one.
No, no, no.
Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find.
How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including 'Stanley is having an affair.' It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
No.
She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
I'm joking.
That's, that is true. [clip montage]
Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody'd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
I don't want to say. But, 'it's fun to stay at the -' [nods to fill in blank, but Dwight doesn't know]
I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.
Stop spraying me!  Gimme the bottle!
Phyllis, can you do this?
So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
Why me?
Oh my God.  You're not going to be able to talk back.
[into mini recorder] The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...
[as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
Crazy.
Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
[watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
Mmhmm.
All right.
Me had an i-rey time.
Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
See that factory?
Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws 'em off.
Why so you can do it?
No, it was a tough audience.
I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?
Well, no no no no no...
Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.
What are you doing?
Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?
Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.
Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm.
Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide.
Just hit me. You'll see.
--that none of us can be a part of--
For?
Oh!  Eww... apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
[hits Pam in the head with a piece of paper] Off the backboard!
Yeah, do you?
Yick.
I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
Nurse.
Check please.
Mmm...
Yes, I did.
You can.
Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
What do you want me to do Jim?
Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.
No, don't worry, the chain is off.
To Can-A-da.
No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
Listen to me. I like you so much.
I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
Right.
You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
Oh, why do I feel like crap?
Take it easy.
Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  [Jim pushes speaker phone button]  Michael Scott here.
It's the European cut.
Hold on, hold on! Just-
Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
[with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
[walking into the office] Good morning Erin.
Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
[holding back tears] Okay...
No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
Oh, yeah.
Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
...Danny Glover. [Jim raises hand] Yeah.
We're all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I'm doing this for you.
It's not very well written, but you get the gist.
Uh-huh.
Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.
You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
Took me all night.
That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
Alright.
Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
It's just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.
There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.
No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.
My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
We like Cugino's
Don't...
Even as pie.
What is a closer?  A closer is a sales term for someone who always gets the job done.  And that is me.  A B C, always be closing.  Glen Garry, Glen Ross.  'Hey, gimme the Glen Ross leads.'  'No way, they're just for closers.'  'Do you know who you're talking to?' 'I'm Michael Scott.'  'Really?  Well, take any lead you want.'  'No thanks, I don't need 'em.'  Because I have a client list [taps screen] right here in my computer.  [sighs] So suck on that.
Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.
Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
Saving him!
That's right!  I am not thinking.
Hey, Carol.
Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
What?
Thanks.
That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
[hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.
Good luck.
Come in!
Bye.
No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat]
Thank you.
You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
Okay. [Jan leaves Michael's office; Dwight enters]
Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
No. This is delightful, charming culture.
Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -
Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.
Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
I think it went well. I think it was good.
[moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? [Pam tosses a handful of Mounds bars at everyone]
Nice touch.  Good.  Let's try that again.
Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
Just forget it.  Just the urine.
You know what? Get Pam.
Same thing.
If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
Where?  I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let's go.
Comedy; it's funny.  It's Johnny Carson, Karnak.  It's, um, put it back.  Huhhhh, did you have Johnny Carson in your land?
Yeah?
I sorta like the old way.
Yes it is!
You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.
No, I'm not going to settle down.
I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
They were engaged, so... [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?
No, no, no, no. No, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, here's the deal. Um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.
No, it's not. It's lower, so...
Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.
Okay.
I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke.
It is not a waste of our time.
[hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.
We're done. We're done!
When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute. [Phyllis looks relieved] And she still is.
No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.
There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.
Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
I don't know what they're made of.
I know just he place.
Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.
Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
No, no, no!  That's enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.
[to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
He's not going to be a murderer.
That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?
Mmm-hmm.  Saunas.
Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?
[looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby]  Okay, not yet, not yet.  I'm going to go wash my eyes.
Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. [giggles]  It was hysterical.
Okay.
Mmm-hmm.
Thanks Dwight.
Manuel who?
I don't romanticize th- [Dwight nodding and mouthing 'Yes you do'] No...
[in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
I can't, I can't...
We should have your contract done by Thursday.
Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
What's that?
Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
And 'I... love you.'
He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary]
No, hey  it's just kinda uncool, okay? I, just... Play fair, you know, play fair.
So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.
This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.
What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
Toby, Katy.
What are you doing?
I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. [camera pans to different people in the office] Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So... [phone rings, computer chimes, etc.] That's Uh...
Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
Yeah.
No! It was like four years ago!
This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.
Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
[laughs]
I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
Oh, um, potato salad.
[giddy, whispering] Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?
Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?
OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?
This'll be [with Dwight] the day that I died.
Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.
And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]
How late do we have to work tonight?
We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
Hey, hey how is Alan?  Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!
Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...
You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number.
What does that mean?
How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.
I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
I know...
What?
No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim?
Easy.
I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
How about a location?
Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!
I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
Yeah.
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
Are you okay?
Look at that.  Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
Did it work?
You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?'  Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, 'Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?'  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.'  But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  [Dwight nods]
Yeah!
I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. [in British cockney accent] It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.
I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
Uh huh.
No, I can do it.
I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth]
Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
Exactly. I know. It's amazing.
Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [Kelly slaps Michael] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Kelly thank you. [claps] She's not here, but she gets it. That's what we have been looking for. The whole time. [trying not to cry] Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know? It's like Don Rickles on acid, man. Right?
Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
No! [under his breath] God.
Okay, give it to me. You don't know what you're doing. All right. [Michael starts digging]
But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].
[rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
What is the world's largest ocean?
Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower.
Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
It's about you. It's about you. Go!
Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?
Right, but 20 years ago we couldn't and that is amazing. Here's Toby from Human Resources. This is Katy. Toby, Katy.
Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!
I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
We're doing this because of you.  So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.  [to Ryan] Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
...in order to feed the bears.
No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
Ow! God!
Oh... ah, I almost choked.
I was going to, I wanted to.  But I had to start somewhere.
Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.
Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.
Okay. There you go.
Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity.
Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks]
You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
Oh, what's that out there?
[slams palms on desk] Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
Okay.
[sitting at her desk] Hey, Kelly.
So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
Hmm?
Ready to do this?
I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself.  Let's both.
Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That's strong!
C'mon Jim, let's go.
Yes
No, they must have class.
No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.
I did?
Yeah.
EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.
The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.
They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]
Guys, guys-
Tell me.
No, no. What do I do?
Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door]
Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
[sighs] I don't deserve this, guys.
Smiles.
What's up?
Grenadine.
Yaaaaay.
[singing] You down with the Dundies? You're all my homies
Okay.  Okay, here's the straight... dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.
Well, don't let it happen again.
I feel you.
Uh...
Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
Yeah, I'm betting one more.
Walking in the door...
[crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It���s every parent���s dream.
Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn't forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man?
All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God.  Okay, Toby?
Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I don't.  Yes, I do!  No, I don't mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this... call waiting.  [answers his phone] Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.
He's already paying for himself.
Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now we're wasting tape.  I'm gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
Thank you. You, too. [steals a bottle of wine from the bar]
[as Curly] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?
Yeah, I know.
Lowest in town.
Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.
Umm... hey.  Ah, what's hanging?
Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That's what she said.
How'd you even find it?
Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
Well, it's a pretty big check.
[gesturing Pam to be quiet] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.
Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
Oh, hey, Toby. So... It's an analogy.
That's really nice of you to say.
Guys, beef!  It's what's for dinner!  Who wants some man meat?
I'm not gonna date a 55-year-old woman.
There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit.  At the very least it's bisexual.
I don't have a room?
Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let's go.
Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.
Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.
[sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey!
Go home, Toby. Just...
Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '
Hed. Hedded
[starts to cry] Can we have another? I think I blinked.
Erin, look. [holds up parrot rum bottle]
Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
I am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.
Yes, I...
Hold down the fort, I have to do something. [walks up to microphone] Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
What makes them so good?
Thanks.
Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
You're welcome.
Crazy world.  Lotta smells.
Eleven pounds...
I appreciate that, thank you.
I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor. We need to find out what is blocking you. And that way, we'll be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored. May he rest in peace.
Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.
Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. [Stanley looks angry] But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! [Stanley slowly walks over, angry] Come on up here you sick bastard.
Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that's called sales.
Yeah, more like a 1,000.
Buddha.
Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
Ok, let's try another one.  Um...
Okay.
OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]
Mmhmm.
Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was--- that was a---
I haven't told you about her.
Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight's]
I don't know, I don't know about that.
Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?
Oscar, are you Santaria?
How do you mean?
I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.
Very valid.
No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
Tonight?
Per mile, yes.
[groans in frustration] You think it's easy?
The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
No antigravity machine, huh?
It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
No! No way! It... no.
Mm-hm.
Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. [snaps]
[starts dancing with Phyllis] Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
Ye-- No.  Alright.  I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
We're going to have a baby.
The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  [Michael knocks on desk]  Come in.  [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]
Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out!
Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy's play, they took mine.
Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
500 and one penny. One million dollar!
Ah, the volunteer Sheriff station.
I do. It's right here. [indicates to waist]
My lord my liege.
Yes, that's a good idea.
[stares at Diane, eyes tearing up]
Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables...
Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
Dot com!
Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room]
My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you. [clears throat] [shouting]
Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]
What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!
Fine. I love you.
Would you say the sale that I made earlier was huge or...
I could of-
No, Dwight!
Traitor. You are a traitor.
Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
Guh-od.
Time out.  You think this kid could be a fighter pilot?
This guy does it all.
You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
I understand that, Dwight.
Come on, seriously, that?
Oh, man! Man I tell ya. Iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches. [makes 'pop' noise with his mouth]
[at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David!
[back to the basketball game] Dwight, pass it to Jim! Pass it to Ryan!
[knocks on Pam's hotel door] Hello, good morning.
Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
[clears throat and stands] Ladies and gentlemen of... the... table.  I would just like to say what a joy it is for me to be here today, but frankly, at my age, it's a joy to be anywhere [no one laughs].  I'm only forty-four, so I'm not old, and I guess that doesn't really play.  But the point is, I have a sense of humor.   And I implore you all to have a sense of humor as well.  Jan, David, my wonderful girlfriend [indicates Jan, then turns to David Wallace], my gorgeous company... Why don't we all just take a big deep breath... and just relax [breathes in deeply, no one responds].  Good.  That feels good [sits].  All right.  Everybody feel better?
Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie...
I love it.
So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]
We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
Well...
Yeah I'm good.
I've written all of it... in my head.
Stanley's wife is out of town.
Really?
So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous?
Hello! How are you? I'm, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we're going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what's the vibe? What's the vibe of this place?
Dwight, run!
Yep.
So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...
Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been [makes slashing neck hand motion] swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.
Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
Lurk much?  [Erin leaves] I miss Pam.
Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
On purpose?
Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  [holds up painting]  And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.
It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
[in warehouse] Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  It's just the first... girl that popped into my head.  I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?
I hear your voice.
Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?
Karen Filip... [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
So many things.  I don't know.  It's hard to choose.
I have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.
Funny story: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv.  The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says 'Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.' [giggles]  And that was an improv.  Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.
Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
Mmm-hmm.
Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
Here
Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
I'm the mistress?
Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]
Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.
Give him a guarantee.
Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb
Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?
Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?
Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
Really?
Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
Alright.
You just said, let me uh... check my notes.  You just said...
No, you know what we're gonna do?  We're gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.
I was going to be a bottle capper.
Wallace is going to freak.
Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.
I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe.
Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
I dare you to.  Come on.
When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this...
You're not prone to seizures?
How are you doing?
It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...
Hi, Jan!
In the dump.
Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
[looking at gay porn] Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, it's all goooooood!  I don't particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually... it is quite beautiful.
Ok, see what I did?
Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
Ayyyy!
Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified.
Okay.
Yeah, I've been sayin that.
Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
Nope.
No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
Doubt it. [disconnects call]
How we doing on time?
This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. [to Toby] Right? Would you agree with that?
Why don't we just, live and let live?
You are so brave. You are so brave.
OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
[in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.
Hup! [throws cheese puff to Ryan who catches it in his mouth]
Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!
You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?
Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.
So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
I looked straight at the bag.
Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.
Say it.
Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
He's going to absolutely freak.
Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir.
You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
Well, we'll squeeze you in.
It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
Nine dollars. The boys' department.
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
Shut up Oscar.  Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please?  What is so wrong about me?  I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual.  Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.
Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
No, I think they're talking about me.
Pam.
Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-
You get me.
Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...
What a weird day.  I don't understand it, but you don't get to understand everyday of your life.  Maybe five, ten days a year, I'll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened.  Guess everybody has days like that.  Sometimes they're the nicest ones.  Still, I think there might be something wrong with Jan.
Yeah.
Oh, okay. I'll tell you. Let's see here. Three bedroom, two bath...
Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...
Yeah.
Baby carrots. [Angela sits back down]
Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.
Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
[deeper] Da  na na na na.
OK.
You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.
Hey, Dwight.
So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
Very easy to clean.
Shh.
Pam, would you smell my breath?
Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
Please, Kevin.  You're fired.  [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head]  Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  It's home, you know?  I know the challenges this county's up against.  Here's the thing about those discount suppliers.  They don't care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.
And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera]  Jan, I defend your honor.  [to Dwight]  Is that all?
No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
Come on in. Good to see you.
Wonder what I would've been back home?
[off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook]
Ahh... [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face]
Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
Toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it.  It's very funny and charming and heartwarming.  And it rhymes, and if it's not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.  [laughs] No!  So, take it away, Toby!  Whoo!
Oy vey... schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.]
I love it!
I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
[speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -
Cancel. We're canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food]
Well... s-sure I can.
Yeah.
Oh.
No, I think you're gonna stay.
All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael]
Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
Yeah.
All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
No. Do you?
Do I know what?
It's not a Jewish joke, so don't worry.
No, this is geological.
Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
[sighs, touches Holly's sweater, cuts off sleeve, chuckles, sees Word document on Holly's computer named 'Dear Michael,' plugs in USB flash drive to copy file from computer]
Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.
No.
[whispering to Pam] They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
What are you... [whispers to Bill]
[in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...
No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
Who else?
Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh.
I am not going to tell you anything.
Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it.
I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
[returns to office] What happened?
OK.
Office romance. For example, Pam and I are dating, do we have to disclose that?
Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls.
...R-P-E-E-S
I know. God! What is that?
This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
Really?
Best day ever. Best day ever!
If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
It is.
Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
[Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans]
You? You haven't made a sale.
They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case.
That's a pun.
One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
No you didn't.
Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?
Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?
All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.
Hi, Jan.  How are you?
Come in.
Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.
How pleasant. You can...
No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside... and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
Anything's possible.
Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
Do you ever miss us?
No, what happened with Donna?
That's good. Pleasure to meet you.
[at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?
I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.
You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
Mmwa.  Mmwa.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item. [cheering] All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?
I... this is Creed.
First guy says 'Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn'.  And the second guy says, 'Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort'.  And the third guy says 'I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe'.
Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot...
Hey.
[standing with Holly next to 'Welcome to New Hampshire' sign] Oh, it's really cold here.
Be careful. Oh no!! [Phyllis and Bob smear cake on each other's face] Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! [Michael smears cake on his own face]
No-- We don't have--
Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks. [goes to stand on desk] Just stand right up.
[to the camera] This had better be terrible.
[sighs] Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
Well... bleh busted.  I don't...
I don't, I don't have to have that.
OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
Here's a helpful suggestion for Jim.  Jim, instead of e-mailing Amazon, to try and get that CD that you didn't receive, I suggest that you go to Visa and tell them to cancel the charge.
And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn't like.
Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
[collecting pebbles off the street into a jar] Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? [old man voice] Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And I'll tell you what. [shakes jar of pebbles] You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.
I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
Hi, guys.
Well...
Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
Well, he...
I'll call you, too. [to Brenda] So. You are probably gonna get carded, so I can make you a fake ID. We have a laminating machine.
Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
Um... literally two seconds?
Yeah.
Woo! Yeah!
Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.
Well...
[generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations.
It's enormous, but it's got wheels.  We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?
No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.
Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you.
Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
[Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.
Come on, man!
Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
Okay.
The human being man's name was Devon.
Saint Bernard.
Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.
No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
Uh... try 'password'.
Uh...
Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...
Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.
Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
No, not at all come on in. [Toby signing the birthday card] No, no. You can't. No, red hair is my area. We have it on tape, so...
Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
Ok. [Dwight howls] That's not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go. [both howl as they exit]
We have fun.
Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.
This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
Okay.
I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I'm gonna get married and I'm gonna have kids.
No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
She was from Europe.
God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.
Oh. Alright. There you go.
Dwight, you ignorant slut.
This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
Oh, okay.
Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot. [hurries out]
Here we go!
Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
Umm... I don't know? Average kind?
Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.  I'm so, so sorry.
The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.
Yeah.  I just sort've had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.
La telefona.
[fake coughing] Narc!
Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place.  Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds...
Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
For what?
Ok.
And classy, yeah.
God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
That's what I've heard.
Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
You are also on record as saying 'wittle-ittle,' 'footy-wutties,' 'nummies,' 'jammies,' 'make boom-boom,' 'widiculous,' and 'wode iwand.'
You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
Want some pie?
Roy.
You're right, I didn't even think of him.
Hey.
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here?
Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.
Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.
So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]
Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
Ssshh stupid! Um...
Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
Okay, all right.
OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?
You're not from paper?
It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.
Plenty of space in the parking lot.
Don't you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that's able to eat up that other emails? I read about something like that. Well, I am in America and I am online, so I do think it involves you. Uh-huh. And if I were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler? I'd... Yes, I will hold.
Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans]
Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
[to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?
How do you know that?  What is it, then?
There you go.
I'll be six.
Aww, none of your business.
So which way are you leaning?
Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
Da  na na na na.
Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. 'Mental' is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it.
No! Better!
I haven't signed them, ok?
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!
Thanks, Steve.
Do you like TCBY?
Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed. [cheers and applause] It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars. [auctioneer voice] 300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400-[speaking gibberish] Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450 [speaking gibberish] Sold! For 300 dollars to me! [bangs gavel, which squeaks] What the hell is that?
So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
No, it will not be. I am on top of it.
Oh. You waiting for a call?
So check out how we live
Burger with cheese!
So maybe. See ya.
I'm digging.
Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.
What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
Fourteen years.
Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
Thanks.
It's complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.
Exactly, thank you.
If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
[in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!
No, this is my quest.
All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
Eat it!
Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
Coffee?
Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.
Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?
Yes.
What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
Who's got the hungry?
So what you're saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I've fallen and I can't get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?
Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
He said, we have been sold. [upset murmurs]
I will have to answer.
You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham]
You did?
I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
Okay Meredith, let's give it a shot.
Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.
I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
100 dollars, great.
[under his breath] I don't know about that.
[all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
Come on, Andy, seriously.
I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
[scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home?
Are you pulling my leg or...
Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real.
Here we are.
Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.
Okay.
Post-it Notes.
Oh very funny.
Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ?
He's funnier than me.
[in unison] Summer!
Yes!
Pointless.
It won't.
Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
Oh! You got it? What is that? [Dwight building his gift]
Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he's handing it to him]
Yeah.
Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
[rubbing noses with Holly] You're the one.
Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office.  Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead]
No I didn't, just please don't...
What?
[looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
Hey Martin, how's it going?
Do you? I don't think you do. Devon was one of my best buddies. And now he hates me.
Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?  In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.  In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.  This is considered to be polite.
No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.
No, what did you say?
SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.
That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...
What's the um, saying, 'once their laughing they're... that's... Once they're laughing that's 50 percent of them being horizontal. So, not that I'm just... Not that that's my... that's what I'm trying to do, but I think it helps kind of melts the ice. Breaks the ice, melts... Breaks the ice and melts them. Melts their hearts.
I will do my
No, Jim brings in money.
Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
I call shuffle.  Here we go.  [Spreads cards out all over the table]
Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?
No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.
I need to know... who shot Johnson!
Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
Oh, that hurts.
It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
...Wait, Ryan said that?
I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]
No.
Oh god.
42897.  Ok.
You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
Ryan?
I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!
Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?
Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.  I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.  But now, no.  I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did.  I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, 'Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends.  Go get yourself a monkey kidney.'
Cruise control.
Oh, did not!
Wow, Kevin, really? We're- [to Jan] Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here?
...uh, no.
I have work to do.
Yeah.
Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
[on speakerphone] Yes?
That? In the conference room?
That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
Mmhmm, okay.
Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]
No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
No, no, no, no.  We don't do that.  We don't do that.
Okay, uh, well, one is taken.
Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
I will take the fall. I did it.
No, no, Toby. No.
Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
Did you get lucky?  Oh!  Boink!
Do I have a nickname on the court, um? Well, The Answer would be nice, but it's taken. So, uh, probably The Question. The Answer dishes to The Question. The Question back to The Answer. Answer over to The Question. The Answer, whew, [makes shooting motion] three points. The Question, whew, whew, [makes shooting motion] six points. Nothing but net. Question, who's the best player in the league? Answer, The Question. Or the Drunkmeister.
Yes. I said that yesterday.
Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.
Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision.
Okay.
[whispers] I guess not.
Nine days, though. That's, like...
Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.
Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
You never said anything.
That's right!
You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
You're breaking up.
Okay, good. Good.
Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs]
Thank you.
I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
Who?
You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.
Morning.
Wow! That's a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop.  It.  [Dwight beings to dial] Don't.  Don't.
Spamster!
I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.
That's my corner.
So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]
Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
Okay.
500
No, seriously.
[flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday!
All right...
[still brushing teeth] Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.
And there's our smudgeness.
You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied. [puts lei on Angela]
Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old.
And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf]
Ryan?
That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model.  I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.  There's face models, hand models, body models [Jim raises hand] - yes.
Nope, that's Tuesday.
Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. [claps]
Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
Is it going to be worth it?
Good morning, Pam.
I'm Michael. We dated for a while.
[groans painfully]
Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let's get back in there. [no takers] Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let's go.
Great marks, Phyllis. [Phyllis walks out of Michael's office smiling]
Uh... it was like eight years ago?
About what?
It would look good, on my mantle.
Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can.
We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right.
Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.
Well...
[gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good?
Alright, so, teams forming.
You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
Um...
You're...you know what?  I read in one of those books that you're not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.
You too, have a good night.
That's my white out. Get your own white out. Just... what's the matter with you? God. [Toby leaves] Okay, um, there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Who had a big, puttifflin. [thinking out loud] Mifflin, spifflin.
Yes.  Thank you.
I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.
Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. [moving on] Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
Thank you for your honesty.
So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
We ought to have this thing serviced.
Ry-an.  You're here.  Whatcha got, whatcha got?  Alright, Panic Room, Maverick, Nell, Sommersby, The Accused.  Where's Little Man Tate?
Okay. I appreciate the feedback.
No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]
[in nerdy voice] Con-- you look like a nerd.
Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.
[walks into room] Okay.
Oh, I guess that job that I got you is working out for you well, then.
Yeah, that's smart.
Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
It doesn't matter what I know.
I have some, uh, experience.  I, um, once had to testify in a traffic accident case.
See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!
All right.
No, of course  you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.
[waving goodbye as the bus drives away] See you in a few months.
Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
Ok...
I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.
[Dwight is wearing a bra] You just twist your hand until something breaks.
Okay.
Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.
Well the invitation says VIP's only.  Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan?  We're already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I'm going to throw up.  I'm throwing up.  You're making me throw up, Ryan.
Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
Mmhmm.
Well, it has certain connotations.
I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
Okay. [starts round of applause]
You're gonna be okay, it's gonna...
But I'm the Godfather.
Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.
[walking in] What's going on?
Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car?
This is it.
You will find love.
OK.
Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
This is the party.
Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it's a booze cruise, but it... There's more to the story than that. It...
Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
Good. Okay.
There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.
We'll go.  I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
[crying] Oh, God.  Oh, God.
You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
Uck... T.M.I.
Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that's how they got a core.
You didn't know it was my birthday.
You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
Hey. What...
No.
Yes, under my tutelage.
Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don't know whose fault it was.  I wasn't exactly looking at the road.
Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
Shut up, shut up.  Hello?
No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. [Jan sighs] ... I'm just kidding.
Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
Hell, yeah.
All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.
Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.
All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
Whoa, 'scuse me!  Oh!
It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.
All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
No, that wouldn't-
Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig.
So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?
No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?
Check that out, huh?
Alright. No more meetings this week.
Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much? [everyone starts laughing] Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
No, no.
You can not, I have a thing tonight.
Pac-man [imitating the noises of the video game Pac-man eating dots]
Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... [Jim draws a triangle around Michael's diagram] ... I have to go make a call.
Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?
It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let's just do what you were going to do.
We have to put an end to this.
Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss. [Dwight closes door, takes off glasses, kneels in front of Michael's desk]  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?
Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
Jan... Ryan.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
Yeah...
Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
Sorry.
Ah. Well. That's not true.
Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.
All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
And shake! What? Go ahead.
[banging on the glass] Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don't talk to them.
She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone]
No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
I think you are wrong.
Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh... I check the jewels every month. This time... You know, it's a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So... What's, um... What you eating?
No you're not.
Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. [sighs heavily] Okay... okay.
Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.
Ok. [beeping slows down]
You want more?
I think it is. A guy told me about that.
You're welcome.
Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.
He said no.
So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
They call it Scranton.
What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
Oh God.  Well, that's an interesting theory.
Not so much.
Keep.
I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --
[mumbles jibberish]
Don't shave my lips.
[mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.
Oh, come on.
Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
I looked at Wallace and I said 'I quit!' and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said 'You have no idea how high I can fly.'
OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... [Bleep] I take care of my kid!
Wow.
Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]
We're going out of business!
...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.
Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
Did you? What did you love about it?
Give me the phone.
[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
[rises] Oh, thank you.
There's the x-ax...icks.
Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
[visibly shocked] What? Why?
It's right here on the desk, yeah.
All right.
Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
[sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. 'Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?' You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
All right.
Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
No, why? Why would I... ? You could...
Yeah, oh there you go.
[standing in a line saying goodbye to the kids going to Mexico] Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We're proud of you. [starts to walk down through the line and into the bus] Bye. Okay.
Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! [runs out of conference room.] Come on everybody! [all quickly follow]
Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman's pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
I did!
The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die.  You knew that.
I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, 'Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?' These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.
But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy]
Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
Get back, get back.  Come on, get back to the slums.
Oh, well, that's fine.
No, I'm just poopin'.  You know how I be.
Against who?
Shake it, shake it!
... and... we had sex, too.
Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.
I know, I know.
I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.
Shhh. No, you can't have it.  It's too late.
We did it? We did it.
Alright, you drive.
This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
He worked at that telemarketing place.
Oh.  What is this?
How you doin'? You excited.
No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base...
Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There's a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.
I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs]
What is this meeting about?
Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
Uh, I don't know what you mean.
What'cha talking about?  [camera pans to each face in the break room]  Okay, I know what's going on.  You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---
I know.  I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me.  You've been my most trusted ally.
Great.
Affirmative.
Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five o'clock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home.
Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
And we have sex on it.
[as Mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?
You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  That'd be fun.  Friday?
[singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
I'm hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God!
Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!
I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
So...
Nice!
[eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that?
You know let me give you some money for this.
Bye now.
Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well.
But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.
I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
[smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think I'm going to be sick...
You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
Banana fana fo fanley.
This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
It is Christmas.
Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.
They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.
Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. [takes off sweater to reveal tuxedo] I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.
Buenos dias, Jaime.
That's what she...
I hope you're not busy doing something.
All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
We're circling it.
We heard what you said. You didn't cover it at all.
I have herpes.
Nope. The opposite of that.
Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha.
That's good to know. [screams]
Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
We can do this.
No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?
Oh, look at that. [pushing bike]  Smooth roll.
That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
Hey thanks. Thank you.
That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Who?
Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
Let me ask you-
David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?
He is an organ donor.
... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
[pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer.
Hey, can we just focus?
No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
Yeah. Right, snuggle time.
He looks worse.
[sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]
Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!
Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
[Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
Give me...  Give me the diary.
Hey, what time is it?
[on microphone] No!
Line it up Phyllis.
Yes, yes! Okay!
Yeah, I rushed a few fraternities, but you know what? I don't believe in paying for friendships. So, I made a decision not to accept any offers. And fortunately none were made. Which was good, so nobody's feelings got hurt.
Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
To the left?
It was great. China.
Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
Right, right, right.  Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party.  A big office party I need to go to, so...  Can't get out of it.
This is you we're talking about.
And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim's desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.
Guilty.
The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead.
I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.
Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.
You're 'I need you to' is my command.
We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
[knock on door] Yeah.
Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
No!
I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let's don't... Don't harsh my mellow, mon.
Sure.  Kevin, please leave.
Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
Carol used to drink lattes.
Parkoooooour!
[long pause] I am declining to speak first.
Nice dress, Ryan.
Okay.
I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
May I enter the room?
And that is probably why most ads suck. [points to the ad men waiting outside the conference room] Oh, that's them!  Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film. [everyone starts leaving the conference room] [loud whisper] Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?
Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.
Cool. For who?
Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
You can do this.  You can do this.
Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me.' A great boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.'
Okay, I think we're good.
[hands Ryan pencil]  There you go.
Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
My main concern, should I have a safe word?
Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?
I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them.
[entering break room] Who's getting married?
You ok?
[giggles] Go go go go go go!
And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
That's what she said. Pam?
Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.
You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.
Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. [camera pans down from Michael's office window to parking lot below, Stanley is seen destroying Michael's Sebring with a crowbar] Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess [Jim is seen displaying fetus picture on his desk as Pam smiles] and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try.
Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot! [Lots of yelling and flailing of arms by Michael and Dwight]
Let me ask you something.
OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
Yeah, [interrupting gibberish].  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.
Stop.
Trick question!  Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer?
Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.
Ugh.
Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you're obviously single.
Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come.  What's wrong with Dwight?
Ok.
I have to buy another place.
French. Classy.
No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.
Here we go.
Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
I think I do.
Hello Jo.
You are relieved.
Well I think we're past that now.
Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
Today I'm headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention. [makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream] Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.
Huh. Well, maybe those will help. [puts bag of walnuts on his desk]
Mm-Hmm.
No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. [disgusted voice] Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
I have herpes.
No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
The two levels being, uh, 'Welcome to Scranton'...
When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called 'Survivorman.' And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
I, uh, hmm.
Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
Oh, man.
Wow!
Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now.
Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts.
Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.
Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?
Thank you. Sharing...
[as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great. [walks into office]
[as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start.  Um...
[bending Luke over desk, spanking him repeatedly] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
We're so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her]
Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]
...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.
I know.  I love Counting Crows.
Only one that I was kind of worried about.
Never, ever, ever give up.
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
...would I go near---
[trying to stuff balloons below the seats] This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.
Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.
[Jim pushes Roy to the ground and makes another shot] Yes!
Yes.
What?
Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And.
[quietly] No, no, no.
You guys gotta be kidding.
Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.
It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...
What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her 'partner' in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?
Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.
[yelling from Parking lot] Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!
Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.
No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
Thank You!
Would you like to dance?
[clears throat]
You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].
Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
Hold on a second, Cynthia.
No, not right now.
Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... [Erin shaves Michael] god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
Nope, can't make it.
Alright.
Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. [Meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup]
You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves]
Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
Not important.
Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients.
I could have paid for the pizza.
Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.  [singing]  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin' on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I can't explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on.  Tender love is blind---
Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.
Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
Look at his face! Look at his face!
[cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?
Got it.
Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence]
[on the phone] Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can't even find their way to work? That is Dwight.
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or...
Hello.
Yes.
I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.
These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.
I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.
Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.
Okay, I will start.  Um, 'A.' [singing] 'A' my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um...
Those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I'm going to show them that we have nerfs of steel. [winks]
Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.
The same stuff you get downtown.
Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!
Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]
Ohh... kay.
The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
Quiz me up.
[turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
What's the matter... haaaww!
[choked up] Yeah, okay. [pauses, then takes a deep breath] Well this is gonna hurt like a mother[bleep].
Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
Hey.
Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
[Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?
Handed to me as I sat down.  This was my hot towel.  It is still wet.
I was in love with you.
Oh, queer... [realizes he is on camera] eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
Okay! Okay!
I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
Speak.
Okay, okay. Um...
Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here.
Yes.
Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog?
Really?
Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
OK, OK.  Good.  I'll catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye. [hangs up phone]  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.
I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don't.  Please.  [kneels in front of desk] Please give me it.
Boom! Boom!
OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
Ok, good.
Okay, I'm out of here, [pretends to leave] see you later guys...
Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
Hey. You know what the best way of studying is?
Okay. Talk to you Monday.
We should really start recycling.
Thanks for having me.
Oh yeah!
[turns around to see the woman from his description] Ugh.
It's not my decision.  It's mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer--  [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] -- tility.
What?
That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Can't talk, saving the planet.
Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
Okay.
Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash]
No, I did not.
[comes over to hug them both] My girls.  There they are. [Pam walks away]
I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
It's illegal. Can't do that.  Next best thing.
Oh, okay.
I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.
I don't talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.
In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can't do this.
Guilty.
Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
Oh, good. My hooker's here. [laughs] Hi.
I won't
Here we are.
All right, get out. Get out.
Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.
What?
How do you know Michael Clump?
Rolando, [clears throat] I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
Conflict!
Forgot normal talk.
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
What do you mean, 'what'?
Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me. But don't tell anybody that I have anything to do with it because if they ask me, I will say that you are crazy.
Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith's problem?
Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
No need for consternation, everything is under control.
I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
Oh, no, that's a male model.
See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
When did this happen?
Stop.
Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
It's surprise Meredith. One, two...
[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
I think I know what's going on.  Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now.  And there isn't.  But, um... don't tell him.  Don't tell him that.  I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.
And I nevah got caught, neither.
I mean, they're just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth.
Okay... what?
Be my mo manley.
Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
Thank you.  Pam, messages please?
I don't have to tell you anything.
Spite her - ok [laughter]
Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are... [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
[everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
I can, and I have.
Hey.
Oh, I'll be fine.
Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.
What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
No.
Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Here's the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.
I... uh, well, I don't know.
I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.
Well, let's keep this party movin' on.
What is it?
Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.
That's what she said.
Thank you so much.
Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
Nah, I'm okay.
Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Okay. Am I shiny?
Yep, all right.
Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter?  What's the matter? You scared?
Fillipellers, how's it hanging?
Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.
In my condo complex.
Erin... what are you doing?
Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh...
Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.
And Ryan.
[overhearing Dwight's conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
Right.
Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.
Oh ho ho! What?
That's what she said.
The Electric City. Scranton!
OK.
You know this can't go on.
What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Sounds good. Okay, let's go.
Do I?
No kidding.
Keep it. My gift. [hugs Chili's Manager] Thank you. Have a good night. See you next year.
[off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.
Wow.  Thank you.
Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
You don't get it.
Let's do this.
Sorry?
All right, all right...
[sighs] Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
Hey, Stanley, in case I don't see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash. Keep the change. [hands Stanley a piece of Jamaican currency]
No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.
Yes. Right. Good.
When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so...
[everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright.  Let's quit while we're ahead.
She would have definitely slept with me.
Okay.
That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.
It did not.
[exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!
All right. You have to pick up after them.
Ha.
Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.
You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
My biggest fear is turning into him.
It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?
[starts to cry] I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
Thank you. You remember Ryan [Stanley laughs deeply] And Pam is around here somewhere.
Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You.
[still trying the backwards basket] Catch you guys- [forklift drives in front of the camera] Catch you guys on the filippity flip. [misses and picks it up again] Flippity flip! [misses again and grabs it back] Flippity flip! [makes it in, gets excited] Really? [composes himself] Okay, see ya guys! [walks away, containing his self-pleasure]
Can we have the room please?
[low] No, damn it!
Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.
Dockworker's?
Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
Can you stop this?
Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
Anything goes.
I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
[Pam returns] This is one of our staff.  This is Pam Beesly, [takes piece of paper from Pam] receptionist extraordinaire.
Ok, let's take 15, again.
Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
Alright.
Good. The Small Business Man?
All these people are walking around and they're happy and their lives are just going along, ignorance is bliss. But if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster. [imitating monster] 'I'm gonna get you, downsizing.' No. They wouldn't... They'd freak. And I'm not going to play God. They look to me for support. And they look to me for guidance and leadership. And I think if I could lie to them and it serves them, then that's what I'm going to do.
We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it's sexy, it's sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?  The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom.  So.  [to Pam]  I've been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?  [Pam shakes head no]  So, sexy is fun...
T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. 'M' your name is Mark.
You know what?  I should.
[popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey!
Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
Yoko shack.
I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.
Yeah, we locked him up for two years.
I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.  [Michael hugs Kelly, his head in her chest] Mmmmmm.
No. I cannot promise you that.
No.
Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
Oh.
Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
Yeah, I know. I know.
I know, here we go.
Oh, okay.
Ohhhhh...
Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.
You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? [manager looks up, angrily at Michael] Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! [Erin looks thrilled and walks up to the stage]
Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
Yeah.
Okay. Fine. No more PDA.
Road trip!  Right?
What is the matter with you?
Kay.
Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.
[on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
Run what?
[heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
I am?
I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.
Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
Right here.  We have a lot of fun.
I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  That's the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really can't say.  But, yes.
Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
Yeah
What? [toilet flushing] What are you doing in there?
So, I guess we're getting back together.
Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
PB and J, my mom's recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis]
Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well... Jim?
No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.
Yep.
Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
Hello?  Christian?
[chuckles] Hmm... no.
I am glad that today spurred social change.  That's part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed.  ...that's what she said.  Or he said.
Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]
Help. Me.
Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
[peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care.
[slaps him] You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It's showtime. Get out there.
Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]
Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
I'm not giving that to you.
[turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!
Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...
Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
Let's go!
OK...
No.
Buenos dias, Erin.
Bond.
And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael's face, none on the neck]
Yessh.
Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?
And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.
Alright.
Aaaaaaaa!  It's coming!  Here we go! [drops the watermelon onto the floor] Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.
[on [phone] No, I don't think I'm asking too much. I think it's only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that... yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did
I will have the gabba-gool.
I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
Bringing home the bacon.
Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth.  Why don't you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?
Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.
Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
I know, I know.  I think it's tiny.  I think it's too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.
Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.
Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea-[cell phone rings] Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?
You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.
[staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.
[clears throat] No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One 'o clock. Big game, big game.
Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office]
No! No No. No. 'My Stumps.' Like 'My Humps' but a guy with no legs.
Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .
Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
I will do my job to the best of my abilities.
Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.  I will be paying out-of-pocket.  Um... I kinda wish I'd been hit by a car.
[fumbles] Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
What's that?
I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don't wanna lose the baby.
Dwight, Dwight!
Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met.
Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.
Surprise!
Jim, please no loopholes.
Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool.
Oh, God.
Or, 'Total Eclipse of the Fart.'
Okay.
This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.
Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
Who is D. Abramson?
You and your wife, and you have kids.
What's his name?
Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That's not how business works, okay? [sighs] Okay.
Who.
Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down.  You and I-
You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
[laughing] Yes, you did.
Hey gang. Where you been?
[shying away] Look, [sighs] It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
Well you tried.
Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
Of course.
Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
Go, here we go!
Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn't be here tonight...
No. What do you mean?
Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
Well no harm no foul.
No, I don't.
I love you-love you.
All of them.
Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
Seventeen.  I say seventeen squares.
What are you looking for? You bring dip?
[Roy bumps Michael to get around him] OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul.
Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
Okay.
Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
How did you know?
Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.
Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
Alright.
Scuse me! Scuse me!
Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
[singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.
Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
Nothing.
Okay, okay okay.
My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
Dwight is my friend.
You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.
Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.
And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who's actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
Yeah.
Your problem now, Captain Jack.
I think I'm going to make myself some microwave popcorn. [humming] Press 'Popcorn.' Oh, that's gonna be delicious. I just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon. You know what? I could do with some hot chocolate as well. Oh, drat. I can't make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time, unless, I can. Boom! Second microwave for le hot chocolat.
[still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.
Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
Hey.
Well, I-
Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...
Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in]
Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That's my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.
Michael Scott.
She's-- okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in.  It-- it--
I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
Uh huh...
Yep.
That's how devoted I am to this job.
[waiting on Pam to be done with the microwave] Ahhhhhhhhh. [whispering loudly] I'm hungry.
You know who that is?
Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  [in Valley Girl voice] Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious! [laughs]
I think the engineer left.
On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.
That marriage would be a sham.
I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.
Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.
If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!
I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
Do you know a joke?
Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
[looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.
[to Dwight] I vouched for you.
What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. [they continue arguing]
I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. [hangs pictures of fat people on the wall, including two fat people on a bike, the Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man, Elvis, Martin Lawrence in Big Mamma's House, Jabba the Hutt, and a fat pig] They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.
Yes, I am, Charles.
Hello. Pammy want a cracker?
You can toss them.
[in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight?
[low] Damn it.
Oh, thank you.
I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.
I... don't.
Oh, okay.
Take it back. That is absurd.
All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.
You wanna be Santa?
Ahh, come on.
All right.  All right, everybody, we're leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.
Uh, no, no, no Gould.
Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
[in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.
For what?
No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything's great. Just keep living your lives. Everything's gonna be fine. [sighing] You are all such wonderful, innocent people.
Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?
You forged them! You forged the forms!
Hey, you.
I... I... Yes.
One hour.
Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
Return.
I got it on a website, that's not important.
Toby!
Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
[ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out?  [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank]
Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.
No.
That's right! That's right!
I need to have her say...
Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she's allergic to hay. So I said, 'Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks,' and she's like 'I don't like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication.'  And I'm like, 'Well you're really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night.' And she's like, 'What the hell are you talking about?' And I'm like, 'I'm kidding. I didn't put a roof...' [cracks himself up] ... We laughed so hard... It was hilarious... oh... [calms down] So yes, I'm very excited about the Diwali party.
Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?
I don't understand.
Mmmhmm.
Please.
Michael Scott Paper Company only.
I wasn't.
And we did this whole stupid party for you.
That's what makes it so wrong.
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.
Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.
So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?
Really?
[sweaty and chugging water from a bottle] It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. [Music starts playing in the background] Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go.
Hey!
You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. [Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party.
[walking past bodyguards at the door] Officers. Thank you.
Now that's going on?
Oh, here we go.
Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked.
That is true.
At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Really sad.
Get up here, Dwight.
There he is.
Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So...  As far as I'm concerned, [holds up WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] this says 'World's Best Dad'.
Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
Who is?
Let's get down to business.  Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.
No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.
I'm staying in your--  Come on, Dwight.
Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so...
Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
It is.
Why do you hate her?
No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]
We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
Drugs?
Okay.
Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.
Well, it's not official.
I have...
Darryl, would you do the honors?
What is that? A squid's eye or...
Well, they're sold out.
Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.
No, they don't.  See?  [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]
What does that even mean? That is impossible.
Pam?
[sighs] Feels good.
See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.
Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes]
Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
OK. All right. See you later.
[at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. [holding puppy] Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? [licks his nose] I'm being serious. Seriously.
You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?
And it also helps if you've had five shots.
I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.
It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.
[standing on tractor trailer with Dwight and Andy, looking down] Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.
That was deer!? Gross, oh!
Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.
Uh-huh.
AM or PM?
[to Jim]: Hey, you ready?
No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
Oh.  That's nice.
Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!
Hey.
No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]
Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
Any messages?
Hey guys.
Okay.  Hello.
Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.
Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
[sighs]
Yes, I do!
Yeah.
Anybody else?  Who else has an idea?
I'm going to have to do this Sopranos-style. Just whack him. Guys, could you take the freight elevator, please?
Okay. Rule five - safety first,  i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.
Very comedically humorous Jim.
Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.
No, I'm a regional manager---
You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
Over our love.
Well, who's that one?
March 17th.
Sorry Phyllis.
She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
What's wrong? Where's your costume?
Son of a bitch. [enters conference room] Pardon me.
I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.
Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]
[everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.
All right, call-- [leans in to kiss Pam]
Oh God. Get a room Santas!
That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.
Really?
[Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses.
You said butt.
Here we go.
I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
[enters, looks to Gabe] If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.
Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.
Really?
Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
You first.
My last pay check?
This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.
You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won.
Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
Okay. Spoiler... alert.
Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.
Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.
She is a beaut!
Don't wanna forget that.
Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren't enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--
Come... Come on!
I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
Everybody.  He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me.
Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! [all four of them sit in an empty booth with small Dunder Mifflin sign]  Hello!
[stands up and walks away]  I already have my European girlfriend.
Alright.
[in a singsong voice] Lets do this!
I'm good, I'm good.
That is not current.
Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
[Driving with Jan in the car] What do you want to do for dinner?
Oh please.
I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.
Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. [Stanley is still laughing] Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe. [clapping and murmurs of appreciation]
One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an...' Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.
Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.
On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.
Okay.
No more brain damage!
There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
Exactly.
I-
A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
Help me out here.
Excellent.
Oh.
Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.
What?
How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, 'I told you so.'  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.
Yeah.
Good.
[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
[places the gift basket on top of the table] Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.
I'm not kidding.
Hooters?
So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.
Oh! Hey. What is this about?
Hey, how'd we do?
No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.
This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.
Yeah?
Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.
It's seems like ya did though-
Video games.
Island living. You know?
Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?
Five o'clock.  Time to go get my improv on. [drinks]  Little bit of the comedy juice.  Mmm.  Alright, see if you can guess what this is. [roars and flails his arms]  That is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class.  Just a taste of the improv.
Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.
God, does anybody read the paper?!
[claps his hands twice] It is done!
I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.
I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
[Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
Alright.  Alright!  [tears up tickets]  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...
How dare you sir. You are gross.
[flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday!
What is it?  No, just tell me what it is.
Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
[blues singer] Da  na na na na...
Well, thank God you didn't steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.
No.
I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read 'Lonesome Dove' three times.
We're all going bowling!
They don't know that!
Why? Well, theft and stealing.
Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in...
Did she say what it's about?
How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
No, I think you're cutting in line.
No, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.
Oh, here we go!
No, there... Later there was.
Um, what do you play? Center?
I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. 'Hey, you think you can do my job better?' I don't know. 'What's your name?' Michael.
Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?
Okay.  All right, Dwight.  Take my money.  Go ahead.  Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.  The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.  Just ring me up.  Go ahead [Dwight tears up bill].
[knock on door] Yeah.
OK.
It's okay guys... I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.
Because I loves to party and I'm gonna be partying my butt out at this place.
I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.
Just drive faster. I want to get back.
he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.
Boring.
No... God.
Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.
I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.
Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.
I am the guy who roused that crowd.
[to everyone, in conference room] Okay, I made it all up.
No, I did not.
No, no, no it's not against the rules.  She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.
Well, you're wearing it at the office. And [smells Jan] it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.
Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
Here, let me...
It's done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]
It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
[on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...
Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -
Right there. Ah.
The watermark... it's a one time thing.
No... No...
Okay, weirdo.
Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em.
Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
Yes.
Back to the Future? [she shakes head] Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.
Let me see your teeth.  Let me see 'em.  Let me see 'em.
This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'
Ahh.
I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
Humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-
May I have a word with you in my office please?
Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.
Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.
Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.
You know what?  This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people.  I don't care if it's pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.
What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls.
Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin'.
Oh... [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
No!
Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
No, he's not.
[mocking voice] Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair.
Get out of here.
There is no such things as monsters.
Are you kidding me? Stop it.
Oka--
Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick?
Yeah, they used to.
You're welcome.
We are great together. We are a great team.
Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.
Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.
All right.
Well some of us are trying to have a...
Oh, I hate monkeys.
Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
[clears throat] [with a lot less enthusiasm] I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened. [clears throat] This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the 'Don't Go in There After Me' award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...
When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
Gah, the dreadmill. [both laugh]
Oh... okay.  Were you saving it?
The old one two. Let's do it.
Thought I'd catch a show.
She was so innocent.
Cool!
I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
Oh, honey, here's Stanley.
Oh, my god!
Oh!
Oh, boy.
You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.
I didn't say it to him. I said it about him.
That's not gonna happen.
He is.
The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she's not our customer anymore.
I'm glad you told me.
Okay.
Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.
The Electric City. Scranton!
If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.
When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
Alright.
I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
What? No, she didn't say that.
Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
No.
Perfect crime.
Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.
Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.
Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.
Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
Okay.
We have to have done something wrong.
Well they notice it.  Don't you?  You notice it.  It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?
[still on phone with Holly] Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?
We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!
What is October feast?
Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
Not classy at all.
Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...
Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]
I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.
Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
We take separate cars.
Yes.
Huh?
And to King Angela! [hands her a lead] Because today we are all kings. And queens [pats Oscar's shoulder].
It's not amazing... at all.  It's sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.
Hi, I am well, how are you?
No!
Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this.
No, I insist. After me.
Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.
And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.
How long till we get to Mexico?
Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!
To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
Really?
Oh this is a good one.
[over PA] This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. [snickering] I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. [wheezing laughing, starts coughing] Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.
Wanna come over Friday?
Alright who wants to party?
Yeah, baby!
Ok.
Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man.
We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, [Michael is seen whispering to Jim, then Pam] that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.
Insult.
You... oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.
No.
No, nothing happened.  I-I swear, nothing happened.  What, I'm, totally being serious.  A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. [laughs] No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all.  It's off limits.  Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.  It was great.  I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.  So.
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...
[voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend.
Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
Would you look at that? [Hugs Ryan] [Dwight attempts hug] Damn it, Dwight! Come on.
Hey, if there's anything else I can do, just let me know.
Thanks, Kevin. Um... [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan's pregnant belly]
It is.
[grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay.
Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we've learned this, let's continue.  See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.  'You need to do something about your coffee breath'-
[whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
[Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
Do you want to talk about it anymore?
All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say 'Boo' because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!
Kevin, do you accept the apology?
No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
... he cried at the end of it. He did.
I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?
Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
Well-
[hands Kelly a receipt from his wallet] From the mall. That...
I am a bank teller.
Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.
I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
This is it. What do you think?
[while in his reeking office]  I am a big Fear Factor fan.  I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um... [clearing throat]   I can't stand it [gets up to leave], I can't stay in here another second.  No!
Well?
Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
[same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
[to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
That is not the way I heard it.
Let go, let go of me!
I'M TRYING! GOD!
That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
Nnnngah!
Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?
Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
[imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio!  ...Chris Tucker.
Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you.
Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
And that her butt refuses to quit!
[laughs] Which one is that again?
No, no, no....
The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
Well, I call it fun!
Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it?
So what did I miss?
We should come up with a signal of some sort.
Yes.
Ji.. why not? C'mon.
But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
[standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!
Come on. Okay, um... [draws a circle around 'Don't' with a line through it] That's as clear as I can make it.
I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. 'Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself.'  That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me.
You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...
Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
Dwight...
You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
How do I not make any more of it?
Guys, guys!
Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.
Because that's all it takes.
That's what I said. That's what she said.
Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
Stanley Hudson, you are fired.
Yes.
And I used to say 'Hey, got latte?' And she'd say, that's not funny.
Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]
Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show's just getting started.
Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building.
It's complicated with Jan.  And I don't know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
I'm not wearing a wire, so...
Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.
Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.
Why don't you tell us?
Really?
Yeah, good job. Well done.
Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.
[knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...
I'm gonna walk away.
Oh come on.
Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
Good night.
Why on earth would we give you a raise?
What's going on?
[sings] It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
It is a tough one.
Hmm?
There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.
[stops dance] Nothing.
...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
Okay.
Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-
There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.
Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.
Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.
No, no, really not necessary.
Okay.
Dwight. Hey!
Yeah?
Pam.
Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
Yes.
I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
Stand clear.
Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss]
Hey!
You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job!  Rapport!
Okay! Alright, okay.
Oh.  Hello!
Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
Dwight, little help with the bags, please.
You're the best.
Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
Hey, what about Angela?   She's hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.
I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?
I'll take care of that for you. [crumples receipt and throws it in trash] Thanks.
Okay, sounds great.
You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. [entering conference room] [as Mikanos] What is taking that guy so long?
I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
I've been told that I'm a tactile learner.
Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
- since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?
I think he is.
No, you lost those clients.
Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.
No one's even going to notice.
I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.
Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.
I want to see it.
Is there another option?
What is it?
I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, 'Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?'
Hi, Oscar its Michael.
Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
Okay, I have more of them.
[on phone] It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. [hangs up phone, blows train whistle] I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called 'Curves.' I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!
Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
You get to look at her.  Why don't you hold out your hand. [hands Brad paper] Tell me what you feel.
Uh, wh-why would she say that?
We did it!
Look, my clothes are so wet!
[Dwight and Stanley are in sumo suits] Ready! Go!
Dwight, you gotta move!
Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
[pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
Oh, shiii...
When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
This is plenty complicated.
I've never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.
He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.
Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
Any nuns?
I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
Be respectful, Dwight.
Second bedroom for the ladies. I mean, the extra ladies who aren't in my bed, or for friends or family, whoever wants to pop on by to casa de Scott. And right in here... What, what's in here? Uh-oh, bedroom number three. What are we gonna do in there? Limitless possibilities.
I don't care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
How can you be sure?
Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.
Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
Yeah?
Ok, I am going to count down from five.
How's everybody doing today?
Never...
Yup.
They're good, huh?
The what?
All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
I always do.
Anything?
Trouble.  Okay, alright.
And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
Yes, sir.
We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. [imitating Sean Connery] The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow! [camera pans down to Angela pinning Michael's pants]
We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?
Hey let me escort you to your desk.
Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---
Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.
You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?
That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.
Okay, okay, okay.
Just. I need your urine.
Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
M-hmm.
Okay, who said that?
I did not, not, not use those words.
Kevin, stay.
Alright, have fun.
Hamster.
Just sell it.
It's ok, they're with me.
Okay.
I mean, you just come in and you're just negative...
Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
Oh, so that's what they are saying?
No...
Excellent!  Good job.
Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.
Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
You're welcome. Thank you.  Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
Please, not at a time like this. [sighs]
Grass, weed?
Watch out, Pam. You're next!
People have been filtering in and out.
Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
No.
I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?
Oh.
Hello, Rolando, how are you?
[In Horshack voice from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'] Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
Alright! Here we go!
No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?
I really, I don't want to get panty liners, please...
What's the problem?
[laughing] Right!  [serious] And I take that as a compliment.
To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
I'm not saying that's what he said.
Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.
Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight?
[knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
But you said you liked it.  You've always admired it.
Well, let's...
I think you're doing a great job.
There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
Dwight--
This is where the magic happens.
[picks up a basketball and dribbles it away from the basket] Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip. [throws the ball behind him and misses the basket, tries and misses several more times]
[hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]
It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
[points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
Wha- what?
Okay.
How did this happen, how did I get this?
Well, you didn't even hear it.
Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.
That's all, you didn't mean it?
I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]
[helping Ryan out of the taxi] Come on, come on.
Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
Okay.
Well...
Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.
You just said 'part of your duties are to' something.
That's, that's a pirate movie. [Jim stares at Michael] That's annoyed. Well, he doesn't do very well under pressure.
[to Pam's mom] Hey.  Hi.  Do you--would you have a snack in your purse?  You're a mom.  I just figured you might have--
OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesn't even need to be good.  Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins.
Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
Perfect. [starts closing the door]
Excuse me. Yes?
Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
Hey.
Hey.
Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
You know what Erin you do have to.
Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
Good, what's funny?
Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I'll leave right away.
[reaching to open door] I'm gonna do it.
Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
[sitting on the roof of the office building] Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.
Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. [laughs] No, uh,  seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. [looks at Pam] Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.
Excellent!
Wow.
That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
[singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter...
She's foreign.  I am--
I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
What part of 'I need to pee' do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
Jan.
PSST! PSST!
You are? What bar?
So it's a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  It's not anything you would have ever done.
Okay! Excellent. Oh...
I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
What?
That's what you're going to do, Luke!
Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is?
Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
No Michael here, my name is-
Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow.
Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
Ah.
Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
Hey, Stanley.
What are you doing?
Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
Internet.
[in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
Here ya go. [throws laundry]
Um, yeah.  Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
And?
Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
All right.
Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually.
Ohhh, great.  Well, now I'm in a terrible mood.  Let's do your performance review-
Pam, you're trustworthy-
[embracing Oscar]You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  [awkwardly kissing Oscar]  I did it.  See.  I'm still here.  We're all still here. [everyone claps]
Phyllis?
Ah, what? Which memo?
Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.
Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
Oh, god, Darryl!
Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.
Perfect.
[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?
So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?
Yes!  Yeah!
I'll call back.
Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.
That's right, let's do this.
OK, use your imaginations.
Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.
Pammy?
Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
[next house] Congratulations!
But it was not a fair fight.
No, it's Michael Scott.
Bye.
I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin? [clip montage over Daryl's Dunder Mifflin jingle]
Well...
Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
Okay.
Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.
[holding up knife] What is this called again?
Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid.  Where am I gonna go?
All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.
Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?  Like I begged you to?  Pam would have understood.  Heck, Pam would have done it.
I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.
I have been saying the word 'manager' a lot, so whenever Jo thinks 'manager' she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.
To jump start a car, first pop the hood.  Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.  Then you take these and clip them wherever.
Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life. [whispers to camera] saved it.
Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A 'Michael-idea' folder?
No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.
No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' [they all laugh] I won't say that. I'll something like that.
Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.
Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
We start on a single blank sheet of paper.
The Electric City. Scranton!
Oh, God! [chokes on food] Oh. Wow.
Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
[crying] I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. [picks World's Best Boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk] I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. [dials on his phone]
What?
Yes. Count to three, please.
Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm  against violence in the workplace.
I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.]
Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  [Kevin groans]
Oh...
Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!
I changed it.  To Chili's.
Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
I don't know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
Well.
Hi Ben, Michael Scott.
No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!
Put it down.
Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
Nothing.
My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would....fall down. But then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He...stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don't want that to happen to you guys. I'm not gonna let it happen.
Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.
Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.
Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. 'Home Alone,' 'Risky Business.' Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
I'm looking for the toy drive box.
What're you wearing?
You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.
You are.
Don't sl-', ok, that's blank [Dwight picks up note] Don't, just put it-
Do the monkey face.
Yeah. Do you have any ice?
You got it?
I'm sorry. [puts food in his mouth] Ugh.  Apricot.  Made of real apes.
Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.
Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples.  Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
[still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
Oh, do we? Do 'We?' Is that what 'we' want? Why don't 'we' take a vote on it?
Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
Wait a second.  You're not into her?  Are you kidding me?
Wait a minute.
Mm hm.
Hi.
About what?
No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
Uh, I'll drive.
I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.
No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.
I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
[leaving his office, hurrying to Jim's office]
We want the same things.
It was not, it sucked.
No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it.
Hawkman.
[leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
Then I will name your team the Red team.
That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
You know what? I don't think it's in...
What?
[in Ryan's office, which is illuminated blue] She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
Hmm.
I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.
Have you ever seen Santa?
I'd like to make a wish.
[on Youtube video] There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. [phone rings, Michael picks it up] Michael Scott, as seen on TV.
You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
I do.
So Bernie's, huh?  We're all going to Bernie's? [to camera]  Go to Bernie's?
Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?
Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
Smells good.
You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.
I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?
That is the way Southern people talk.
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
In business school, Kevin. Business school.
Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
Divorce. Um... OK, 'Meredith is so old...'
I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids.
You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin! [turning up volume]
How, would you stop interrupting please?
[sitting in Holly's lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
You're welcome.
Oh! [to the theme of 'Jaws'] Dun-der. Dun-der...
He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
AH! Guh-oood.
My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...
Exactly!
No, just get me a case. [Dwight looks at the camera, lifts his leg onto the desk, removes the sheath from his ankle, and gives it to Michael]  All right.
500
Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
Okay.
Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee]
Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything?
Oh- She's not here?
Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
Nah, he's an ass.
[singing] ...since the world was turning.
[howls like a wolf] Oww whoo whoo! The Answer was on fire!
Yeah.
Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, [cut to Dwight standing on a box with 'LIAR' written on a piece of paper hung around his neck, Dwight's head hung in shame] and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.
Yes.
No, you don't.
No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.
Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
Yes?
Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
Oh, no.
I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.
I just saw this baby daddy-
Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.
This was Jim's idea?
Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk.
Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...
Mm-hmm.
No, no. I celebrate privately.
What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.
Well... [exhales] OK, well...  Um, wasn't really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
Mm-mm.  Todd Packer.
Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
Ryan.
You're all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly. [phone rings, Phyllis reaches to answer]  No.  NO!  [phone continues to ring]
Okay, okay.  I'll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley.  All right.
Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!
[seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn't see it at home, I didn't see it in the bathroom, I didn't see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light...
Ah, you do. So...
Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
Thanks.
[sighs] Fine.
Shh!
It's the best.  It's the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.
All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right.
The CFO? Ohh...
Stan the man.
Oh, you have your own entrance. That's nice.
Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
Mmm-hmm.
Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.
Yes I was. Yes I was.
[interrupting] Okay okay okay.
Yes.
It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?
Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.
Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
Yeah!
Okay... that's...
Which one is that again?
How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
Yes.
Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.
No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!
Maybe they are shrinking.
Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, 'I have cancer.'
I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
[whispers] Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave]
But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
[chasing Meredith] Come on. Shh...
He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? [pause] Three hours. We're half way done.
That is a very, very funny story.
Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
Yes.  Join me please, won't you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office]  I am going to give you a raise.
A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
Push it.
Ok. Thank you.
Yeah, can I point something out to you?
I'm just getting hardcore with him.
I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.
Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.
Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
I need more time.
Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out.
Try 80.
Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.
Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it]
Smell that. Do you smell that?
It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.
Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
What?
Yes.
Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time... Yes.
Woooah! Wow!
It's true.
Oh, OK.
What a disaster, this whole thing.
Okay... [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!
I want to make fun of you right now.
Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.
If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That's how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.
This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?
Blue's not a flavor.
Tonight's so...
Hey Dwight, he found it.
Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
No.
Just... try to be cool.
There. I'm doing it. Right there. Great.
[gestures the YMCA dance] Mmm, mm mm mm. [Dwight smirks, leaves]
All right, see you at one.
Pam's mom.
Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
It's... it's one of those two. [points at both]
Ok.
Okay, be my guest.
Thank you.
Very cool.
Like the witness protection program.
Here we go.  Alright!
Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don't.
I can't hear you! [less applause]  Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be...
Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
No, no, that doesn't make any sense.
We're okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?
Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.
Maybe.
Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.
We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
So how are things going with Andy?
Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]
No, not at all.  Nope, come on.
Are you kidding me?
It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
I do okay.
Yeah, well duh.  Where ya headed?
Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Can I have everyone's attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it's like to be disabled?  Oscar?
Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
What?
These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
[rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
God.
Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.
Kevin, stay.
Yep.
What do I write under 'reason for visit'?
[on phone] Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!
That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Why? I'm not your father. [Erin looks sad] All right.
You're right. That's good.
Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?
Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?
Other than me.
You don't have all the facts.
Go buy some watermelons.
Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  It'll cure all of your 'Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother' and fixes all occurrences of 'I don't really see them together'.  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.
[Dwight looks confused to the camera] Were they in the missionary position? [Holly laughs]
Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh! [Clutches chest and falls to the floor]
Thank you. [groaning ceases]
I don't think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.
Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?
Ok, it's done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now it's done.
Oh, good.
Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
What is that... word?
This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]
I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.
I owe you an apology.
There's... a name.
Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.
I'm putting my bed right over here.
[returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.
Holdin' down the fort.
Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch]
[points at camera] They're gonna have... You can't say that, all right?
No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.
Erin?
Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like... [singing] Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah...
All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.
As I was saying it.
I know.
When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
Mmm hmm. I like 'em.
Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
What?
Oh! [rips open cardboard box] Wow. Awesome. [distributing items] For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.
Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! [everyone claps]
Yeah.
Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
Yeah.
Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
Thank you very much.
Yes. I kind of arranged it.
Thank you!  Wish me luck!
What?
That's it, that's it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
[laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.
[accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection.  We still don't know who the murderer is.  [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can't do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?
Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two.
Hmm?
Where are the yams?
- follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. [Toby's chair spins around to reveal Dwight filling in for Toby]
I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
Why?
[knocks] Hey, what's going on?
[kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.
[music playing] It's a pretty lame party.
Whatever.
In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.' [laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that. Doh! Hogan! Not again, Hogan! Get Col. Burkhalter on the phone! [laughing] I'm kind of a Hogan around here. And kind of, Jan is kind of Col. Burkhalter, then Dwight is Schultz. But, it's... Oh, God. We have fun. We have fun. 'Cause he's gonna be pissed. [making voice] No doubt about it.
Okay.
Alright. Hi. Any messages?
Okay. Alright.
You sent him cards? You never met him.
Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.
Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.
Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.
Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh...
Maybe neither.
[Toby running to get on the cruise] Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat.
All right, yes.
Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one.
Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]
Good.
Yeah!
My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
[ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
No, no you're wrong about this.
Why?
On your left!
Learn by touching.
So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
You talking to me?
Hey.
How did you...
NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked.  Thank you.
Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
What, are you talking about me and Holly?
Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.
Yeah...
[approaches Dwight's desk] You'll never guess what I know.
Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
We are?
OK.
[climbs under desk] Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from 'Look Who's Talking.' What am I thinking? [Laughs] Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
Shut up. Shut up.
Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I don't think so.  Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions.  I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.
I can't tell you.
I don't know, I don't know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression---
Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
I could have helped.
Hello, hello.  Hey!  Your face is almost back to normal.
These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?
Ummm-hmmm...
[to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey!
When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--
I don't need to cheat.
Yes.
Okay! I'm sorry.
The Electric City. Scranton!
Thank you.
[in video]...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
Thank you.
[in Michael's car] Okay, just throw out all the empties.
Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
No, you wanna leave.
I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That's the life.
I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
Now you ruined it. [gets up and leaves]
That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.
That's... I, I think that...
It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. [points to Pam's' pregnant tummy]
Moon each other.
Why would I do that?
[in line to fill up water bottle behind Kevin and Toby] Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?
Nothing. Cocoa.
Are you kidding?
... Okay.
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: 'May your hats fly as high as your dreams.' ... That was a pretty good line.
Yeah, that got a little out of control. Jan's taking a break, which is fine. I'm doing the same, just chilling. Getting my mind off of us. She's right. I need to be more professional at the office. When I'm at work, I need to focus on work. I should call her ex-husband.
I just think that HERO? It's cute, but it's... It's empty, you know? It's easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind...
[Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
Carol?
[runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
Alright...
What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
No, it's not. Just shut up.
Pam! It's Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.
Forget the question...
Dwight... [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight]  Give me the bottle or you're fired.
Just give it!
Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.
Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter]
Your nose?
This way to the party bus. Good.
An Indian Halloween. Okay, great. [to phone] Pam, could you put Jan on, please?
Oh, oh, oh!  We'll get somebody to clean that up.
Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.
I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.
Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
Your dentist's name is Crentist.
Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They're lithium.
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?
Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go!  OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke.  OK, let's do it.
...and you just walk negatively.
What?
[clears throat] Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted.
Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
Canada.
It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.'
Thank you, Al Gore... for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn't do that ten years ago?
Oh, I still have more.
What!?
I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
Oh, my God, what happened?
Oh! OK!
What do you know about management, Dwight?
Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
[accidentally into his microphone] We're going bankrupt, you think? [angry jeering from the crowd] They are really angry.
Ok.
[in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.
You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you're not doing your job. Why don't you just resign?
Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting's not over.
Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.
I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
OK, I am really going to do this.
Yes.
Jan, you... complete... me.
Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?
Me too.
Okay, well, I really think that... [dial tone beeping]
No. No.
Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.
Yes. Thank you.
Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?
Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.
Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.
I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.
[over phone]  Is that Pam?  Hey, have her come out!  Have her come out!  It would be like Coyote Ugly.
Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.
You know what this is? This is a stinger.
Good luck.
Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I don't care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.
Well, I'm writing a message.
Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
I don't know, actually.
What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
...wall-to-wall carpets...
I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.
Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
No sales topic per se.
What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
Uh huh. Yup. That last thing they did was great.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
Federal and State. [no one bids]
Oh, it smells good in here.
No...
[enters office, somersaults onto couch, kicks over painting and lamp] Parkour!
Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
What do you say, Jan?
Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.
Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
Okay, okay, what's better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
But you just said 15.
No, I've seen the video.
You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where 'Dunder Mifflin' is listed right above 'Michael Scott Pap']
Big...
Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?
Bull[censored] man!
What?
Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.
Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?
I will allow that.
Oh my God!
Hey. How's everybody doing?
Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad.
Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
That's not how I taught you, right? [singing] My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out [Dwight imitating drumbeat]
Oh, my God.
Booty call.
No. I don't want to do any of that.
Who is Dr. Perry? I...
Are people watching?
No.
Let's go.
You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
You writing your memoirs over there?
Can I hold her?
Did you know I used to be in HR?
[coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you?
No.
I'll just throw out some suggestions.
What?
Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
English?
[hangs up phone and walks back into conference room] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.
[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]
I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
Aw, it's alright.
Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard!
I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]
Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
[quietly] No.
Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.
No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
A hat.
Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit -
I had a great idea until you ruined it.
No.
Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.
Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?
No, they're just hotties.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
[talking to an attractive woman] Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.
Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]
Mm hmm.
Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So...
Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. [to cameras] Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok.
I hadn't planned on including him.
But I got all the foot off of it.
Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! [snickers] So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That's how I want every day to be.
Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about.
For a CD mix tape...
How?
Here's the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That's what happened to O.J.
No, nothing like that at all.
All right.
Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
Absolutely but not really.
We tell them the plan, right?
What?! That would've solved all my problems.
Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]
Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
Nothing, I just...
No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.
No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
[obviously faking being serious the whole time] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh]
Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
Are you kidding?
OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
Michael Scott.
I need him gone.
Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.
It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
Hey
Nope.
Oscar, paint ball pellets.
Yesh.
Tell me if I'm smiling or not. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling?
Really?
You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have?
Explain that.
Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...
Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.
[slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?
Yes.
No.
Yeah.
Oh, big time.
People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
Doctor David Friendly's Egg Yolk Diet.  It's, it's kind of unique.  It's just, my diet the last couple months has consisted mostly of eggs yolks and cottage cheese.  And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing.  You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers [shot of Michael peeling boiled egg] and I, it's just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.  I don't even, I don't even use a plate anymore.  Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg [Jenna breaks as Pam and laughs] I know, I know!  But you know what?  It's perfect.  I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?  Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing.  The guy, I think he was like four hundred pounds when he started, and he started with this... I, well, the melon baller was my idea.
That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
Shut up, Dwight.
Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider.
Ryan.
Oh my God!
[knock on door] Yeah.
Sure.
[tea bags on eyes] Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to?  Not at all.  Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.  Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.  What are you gonna do?
Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
Just crunch 'em.  Just crunch 'em please.
People are always coming to me. 'Michael, I have a secret.  Your the only one I trust.' No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend.  This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?
What if they made out? In front of everybody?
I'm right in your crack!
OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
Okay.
I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
People say I am the best boss. They go, 'God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious.' 'And you get the best out of us.' [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.
Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
Okay.
[from his office] That's what she said.
I don't know.
No you ahh.
Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah!
This is Michael.
There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.
I am going to throw you this ball.  When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
I can't change anything. This is the way...
And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
So what was rule two?
Herpes duplex.
Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
That's not a baby.
Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-
Don't mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk]
Wait a second.  That's Weekend at Bernie's. [upset] Do you think that this is a game?
I know. Ugh, that is so annoying. [makes fart noise] Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I've forgotten about? Just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, 'Brr, brr.' And I went, 'Argh, Argh.' You know? Anything? [shakes her head 'no'] Well, if you think of something, let me know. 'Cause I like to know. 'Cause I'm going crazy.
She suckered you too.
Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It's not like gay... shame festival.
David!
Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?
Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.
You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie]
Great, the magic of the gift basket.
Is that good?
Oh, she is hot. ['Hillary Swank is hot' supporters cheer]
No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit]
I'm not changing that, it's the best one.
[watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK?
Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
I know, I know you're angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
Everyone is going to end up dying someday.  And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with.
[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?
And they had no yams?
Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
I have recently taken a lover.
Hey, mon!
Ghosts. Lots of ghosts in this old Radisson. There it is, Rosebud Room. Memories. Wow, this turnout is pathetic. I packed the house, you know.
Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
[whispers] Ask him his name.
We got it.
[talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
Really?
Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?
Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.
Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?
Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
Ohhhh.  Arrrgggh!
Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.
Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
Vikram doesn't have my people skills.
You look great! And you're a princess?
Yeah.
I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks...
No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.
Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
Oh, yeah. [clapping and chanting] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Erin]
I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.
I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay? [exhales]
Oh man.  It's not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.
Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
[hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll kill you.
You don't know that.
Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]
So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
Okay.  Um, her.
You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. [Charles steps towards Michael] Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.
...Jan. Kay.
What?
Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?
Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.
Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
THAT'S MY CAR.
We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.
Oh wow another living room!
Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?
O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.
Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
Oh, great, put her through.
Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.
Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?
Uh, they look that good? Wow. [Mike Myers voice] Oh, Pam please behave. Mike Myers, genius. Um, no actually I got them at a fancier place. Target.
[sighs] Could I?
Two minutes apart.
Yeah, I don't even know why I said booze cruise. I don't even think there's booze on the boat.
It is?
Good. Good. Good!
No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about?  You're... you're worried about the cop's time?  You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
Well, I am heading down there.
Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Okay.  Alright, I'll do it.  Yeah.  Lets do it.  Lets do this thing.  Yeah.  What do I?
Heed. Heed.
No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.
Alright, bye.
MmMmm.  All I need...
Hey.
Of course.
[stammers] Uh... Yes.
I am in.
I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
Oh, wow!
Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You'd better try it on, make sure it fits.
Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
We could go there, sure.
I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Oh, no you di-int.
How about Thursday?
Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?
You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh]
It's true. I did.
[grimacing] That's what she said. [leaves]
Come on, come on.
I am going to run three possible date ideas by you and I want you to tell me which one gets your blood percolating.
I like that, so manager and co-manager.
Oh...
They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
You are my producer, you are a suit.  I am the creative genius.  You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.
Hey, Oscar!  Come on, let's go!
Oh, there's Gill.  Oscar's roommate.  I wonder if he knows?
Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
Oh, Okay.  Okay.  Just...[Michael takes down banner, clears throat]  Well, our old friend Ryan Howard is back, and we're going to give a little presentation about the future of our company.  So please listen up. [awkward pause] All right.
...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
[going up escalator in the hotel] This is nice.  This is nice.  Move in here.  Very sweet... ah.
Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.
I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.
I love this woman!
Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.
How did we do it?
That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
I don't think so, no.
[on phone, leaving a message] Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning. [hangs up] I am going to be... kind of a daddy.
That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...
So I'll know where---
I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
I have rights.
Um...
Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
Ok, alright.
Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?
I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, 'Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason.' I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil.
You're an idiot.
Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right. [throws up hands] Pull it over. Here we go.
Mm-hmm.
Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
Jim, Jim....
David, how much did this house cost?
I just saw him.
Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
Shoot, shoot it.  [Roy hits Jim in the mouth with his elbow] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression!  Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up.
Hey!
Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said.
It's okay.  It's okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.
Do your worst. [they shake hands]
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
You're better. You're better than my best.
That's rude.
I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success.
There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. [DeAngelo laughs]
...Where did you get that information.
And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.
Well I have interviews.
Yeah, yeah he is the worst.
Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]
Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.
What's going on?
Cancel it! Are you still here? [to Erin]
Aw. Well, hang in there, okay?  You know what? You should get one of this big body pillows. That way you wouldn't miss you-know-who so much.
Ahh, wow. That's dangerous.
Mm-do... Dwight would not-
Take a sip of that. [hands Andy his mimosa]
You all right Ryan?
And, ditto.
Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
Oh really? Was anyone killed?
I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.
Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. [in Oscar's ear] Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on.
Mm-hmm?
I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
[sighs loudly] Does it feel good?
Yes.
Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
[Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
[laughs] I'll save you! I'm Superman! Scooperman!
I don't understand- [phone rings] Hold on.  Sorry. [answers]  Yes, Pam.
Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...
Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power.
Well, you're not a romantic.
How can you do that to me?
Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
Follow me, come here.  Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
Nobody thanked me.
Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?
I have a new place.
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
Save yourself!
No, no...
Very good [Jan nods]
I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character 'Mikanos', is just a little added flava. 'Mikanos' is loosely based on another character I do, 'Spiros', who is more about the ladies.
Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.'
What are you doing? ['Goodbye My Lover' by James Blunt plays]
Oh, really?
Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay.
What?
He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.
I don't understand?
Is it?
Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four: Failure is not an option.
These meetings are useless.
Erin, can you give us a second?
[turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]
[thinks a moment] Sounds great.
[mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?
...Chunky. Do you want half?
Yes.
Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.
Yeah!
Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael.
Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.
Okay.
[covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it's done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did?
No. Absolutely not.
[laughing] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.
[screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Yeah, no... [hurries to get up from chair]
Yes, it is.
Yep.
Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?
No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...
If you lay a finger...
No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didn't want hers.  Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.
Okay.
Yes.
Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck.  'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.  I think it's because they respect me.  A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone.  That's respect.
So much for sex without consequences.
Ah, thank you sir.
Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
Shotgun!
You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
[running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
[Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar]  Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!
You say yes, and we go out.
Hey, Merry Christmas.
Yes.
He sounded sick.
No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?
Close the door.  This is your fault.
That is not constructive.
Ok?
Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.
No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
Pam, come on. 'I like your food.' Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
OK, good.
Uh huh.
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
That's a really pretty song.
Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
[laughs] Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a...
Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
Yes.
Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
[driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
[shaking head disgustedly] Okay... okay. [leaves room]
I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
Except driving.
No. Oh, all right.
[nodding] So stupid!
I thought I did. So...
What was that, Kevin?
It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.
They have a TCBY booth.
Don't fold it, though.
Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
No, it is not.
[accent] Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
[clears throat] Hey, what's up?
[Toby knocks on door] Yeah?
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
[on phone] Yes. Well... we can... [Sasha walks in, begins playing with Michael's toy train] uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. [Sasha moves the train to Michael's desk] Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?
Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.
Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!
I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
Well, don't do that. Where are your glasses?
[hugs Toby, who smiles big] You're a good, good guy.
Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend.
Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!
Oh, hey guys. [thumbs up]
[imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.  [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses]  Sorry!  You know what?  Let's go out!  Dunder Mifflin's treat.  Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it?  Ethical.
Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That's... You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
You ready to give me my discount now?
You were lying.
Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up]
Oh that I plagiarized I think.
Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah.
May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
Well...
Every morning.
Dwight!  Stop it!  [moans]  Can you help me please, I'm being crushed.
Good morning.
Isn't it?
Yes.
I would love that.
Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.
The problem is that when people hear the term 'big brother', they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.
Stop...
I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
I already have wine.
Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.
That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.
Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?
No. No, no. There was wind.
You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.
You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
Good to see you.
My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room.
Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.
No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon.
That's right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.
Back to work.
Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
Dwight, can you get those please?
Almost quittin' time.
[walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now.  I will... I love you too.  Bye.
[to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
[watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No.
Clearly that's what you wanted.
Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.
And tolerance.
Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?
No it's not.
No, no, I don't, but---
Maybe.
Here we go.
Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
No. We just talked. He's very nice.
They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
OK, I will play guy listening.
No, for one thing, he's not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.
Well, then I will get a warrantee.
No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.
Because he's afraid to fly.
Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?
Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  I'd really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?
[grinning] Ohhh, God.
Heh, okay, weirdo.
The waving?
In front of me.
Nah, I'm almost done.
Yes.
Worse than that.
Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?
We will?  I can't.  I don't have an idea in my head.
Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.
Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.
...calendar.
No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
Oh, my god. This is it.
Bob, how old are you?
[Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
There he goes. There he goes. [Stanley gets up from his desk, walks into kitchen area]
Well, yeah...
Okay. [Jan hangs up. Toby opens the office door.]
Oh, that is gross.
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!  No deal.  Not with Michael Scarn, FBI.  Michael Scarn doesn't make deals.  Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later. [blows on his fake gun]
Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
Oooo. Catcher or in field?
It is your problem.  That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.
Get me Armani.
Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts.
Stanley, I got you some ganja. I'm just kidding. It's coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.
All right, our next award... ah, yes, this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies' room wall, and the winner is... Who is it? Who wants to claim it? Shiny Dundie. Who wrote it? Great idea, Dwight.
[through the car window] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
Yeah.  What?
Strike while the iron's hot. A joke always works.
No, we are not.
It doesn't have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
[makes squeaking sounds]
[on cell phone] NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... [hangs up phone, sighs] This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. [Karen raises her hand] Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
Okay, the opposite of that?
Wanna head back?
Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight]
Mmm.
Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.
[on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?
Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can't go through with this.
[passes Isabel] Hey, good morning.  [to Dwight] It's about damn time.  I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.  [walks into hotel room]  Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.
But we're bonding down there!
Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.
You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
I don't need to be friends with Pam.  I have plenty of female friends.  My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.
Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
Wait. What day is today?
That's my wife you're talking about, man.
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.
And she took a bite, started to choke. So what do I do? I have CPR training. Go around, start doing the Heimlich.
No, I'm not trying to trick him. I'm trying to be a good mentor. So...
You don't want me to help?
Oooooh, my life!
Abso-fruit-ly.
I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
Must be hackers.
I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.
Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.
Yeah.
The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
How's the party coming along?
[whispering] Dwight.
My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.
Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound...  The air-conditioning leaking or something?
Really?
I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]
No I'm staying.
I can't do the presentation, I can't- [voice cracks] ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! [starts crying, covers his face]
Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright.  It's alright. Here we go.
Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn't even about what Ryan thinks. It's about you. It's about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it.
Yup.
Go!
And laughter... also.
Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
Yes.
I won't.
That's what I said.
[hangs up]
Oh, no, my God.
Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs]
She's kind of a rube.
Any of em?  So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the 'P' situation?
Just make that copy okay?
Yeah?
Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
[barging through office door] Alright. Here we go.
It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don't dial Carol before I get drunk.
Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers]
Who?
Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?
Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
He's right there.  There he is.
[singing] Yeah, all the homies
Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines 'wedding' as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride 'Mawige...
No problem. [doesn't turn off speakerphone]
Are you wearing a new perfume today?
Home, sweet home.
Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.
Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
Okay.
Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
Oh.
Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.
I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
[looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam?
Well, it says here that it's a 300ft drop.
What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
Thank you.
Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
Nope.
So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
Yep.
That's it?
Good night guys. [staff leaves the office]
Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
No, this is completely the time, this is perfect time.  This is just guys gently ribbing each other, it's what it's all about, just hangin' out.  Enjoying friends, all being the same.  Worker bees.
Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.
You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.
Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.
Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree.
... customer service is a Hindu person.
What's going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
Yeah, no, it's nobody.
Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
Hey there.
Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don't want to go by myself.
This is bull****!
No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.
Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
Maybe.
Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
350 and one penny.
So you think you know a lot about business?
Thanks a bunch.
Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.
Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.
I got gum in my hair.
Okay.  From the top.  Ready?  Three-
Oh, here we go. This... um, here's the deal.
Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
Um, oh, thinking about business school?
I'm not gonna be okay.
Yes.
Did you get the yams?
I know.
Why'd you come back?  Why didn't you stay?
Is Packer here?
They're cool.
Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. [opens phone] And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
Finish your cake, Helene.
I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
[eating the watermelon] It is going to be the happiest day of my life. [Dwight gets dressed behind Michael and zips his fly]
Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we're gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn't matter, it's an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.  [to Oscar] Adios!
Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
Yeah, right here. It is right there. [holds up magazine] Anybody read the news any more?
Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
Yes.
This is so stupid.
Yeah, it's routine.  I'm just a little bit scared.
You're right.  It will blow over.  But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?
It's from James Bond.
No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.
Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?
That's a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.
[chuckles, sighs]
Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. [applause]
[speaking with a different voice] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
[imitating E.T.] Holly Flax.
Yup, I'm good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch.
Bye.
MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
Oh, place around the corner. Nice. All right. See you later.
No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...
[whisper] Hey... guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
Why?
My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. [a couple of sounds play on the computer] That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...
That's like...
No, no.  I need two men on this.  That's what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
OK, ready?
How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. [takes back the info flyer Justin holds] Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
Okay, I don't have time for this. I need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration. [imitating Native chant] Me Chief Michael Scott. Here to trade...
So do I sign?
I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
Who else here is single?
Dwight, what is your middle name.
After work you guys...
Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! [Pam grabs the microphone from him] Oh, here we go.
I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
I have to fire someone today, okay?
Take heed of.
Okay.
Hey!  Why don't you just sit down, please?
Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
Bend It Like Beckham.'
No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.
Uh, he's a small client. They don't really buy much.
So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.
You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well.  We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?
That's stupid.
Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
Dwight. [to Kelly] I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
Okay.
Uh, I have a pajama party.  At the Playboy Mansion.  With the bunnies.
Two fifteenths.
What difference does it make whether your here?
Think of it as part of your training.
Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
[sad] Ohh...
This is all mine. All the way down around the corner. It's a shared space, but I can use it whenever I want to,
I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
It's Jim, Okay? Yes.
Yeah that sounds good.
Um, how many people are you interviewing?
Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.
That's what I do, steal my trick.
No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
[to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game...
It is the 'Whitest Sneakers' award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
Nice outfit.
No! You idiot! [hangs up] Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.  [redials]
Pam.
I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
Do you want some coffee?
Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
No, no, no. That's his punishment for not being here on time. Too bad, anchor!
Well you don't need two of you to do that.
Okay.
Okay.
Exactly!
What a horrible day.
No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...
And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]
Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
No, I got it.
Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
Talkin' bout, uh, what?
Oh, you idiot.
Oh, well.
When in Rome.
Hello, everyone.
Yep, never been used.
Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.
Okay, no, I am not.  Dwight! [Dwight runs into Michael's office]  I want you to take Jim's chair.  No!  No!  His chair at his desk.  He gets it back on Friday.
Having fun?
There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.
Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.
I humbly accept the management position.
What're you talking about?
Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping...
Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
[laughing] Come on.
Wow, terminator, terminator.
The best.
Well, I'll be in my office.
Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]
[laughs] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]
All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
What!?
This place is like sexy pre-school.
No, you may not.
[ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
No... way.
Oh my God.
Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
Oh, you know. Nohting. She's  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...
Okay. I'll see you in a bit. [whispering] She's pretty cute isn't she? See you in a bit.
Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend! [sings] Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
It's just a really important day for me.
I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
Titanic?
Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
NO!
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
Oh. Wow. 'Michael Scott Paper Company.' Okay. Very official. 'Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.'
Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!
I'm just gonna call her.
That was the worst joke ever.
Hmm, hmm.
It's totally impossible!
Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.
Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
Hey!  Hunter!  Wha's up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
And then another--
You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
Oh, okay. [nods to him]
Hey.
I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
Alright.
Oh.
Maybe that--
Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
I grab this [grabs a chain saw], and I turn it on and I say, 'Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre.'
We don't know if it's dead.
[gets up to shake David's hand] I quit.
You use your brain too much.
Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?
Never get's any of my jokes.
Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?
You're welcome.
I'll call her later.
Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
Yeah.
Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life.
Oh, what did you do today?
You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
I don't need a representative.
I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
But I'm the first in the office?
And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it.
MACGRUBER!
Forget that.
Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.
It's too late.
Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.
It was the warehouse guys...
Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?
Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...
325, 325.
So? I've beaten up black belts.
Just forget it.
Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver's seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you're dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman's clothes.
[imitating E.T.] Not Michael, E.T.
The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don't act fast, you will lose customers.
Ayyyy!
Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He...
Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.
Mmhmm!
That look?
You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.
Okay. Thanks for coming.
Ok, let's do this thing.  [to Pam] Wish us luck.
It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.
Thank you very much.
I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?
[laughs] I'll be over there.
I'm hearing you, meeting confirmed.
Dwight, just...
Yeah.
Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?
See you later.
No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The 'Hottest in the Office' award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
[sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...
Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.
Dwight.
Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.
Wow, man. That -
Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.
What?
So Phyllis is basically saying, 'Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth.' I gave Ryan an iPod.
Don't talk-
Yes.
What's that?
A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
I went through Holly's things.
She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
Oscar, I'm ready for you.
Happy.
Hey.
[walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?
No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.
OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
Ahem.  What's up?
When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad.  And that's   hard.  And it's making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.
Are we all set?
Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it.
Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
Okay, are you cool, really?
Dwight, what are you drinking?
Jim? Pam?
That's right.
It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- [phone rings]
She has a boyfriend.
I was breathing.
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
All right.
What did you get tonight?
Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.
Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.
Oh, great.
Hello, Jan.
Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.
I'll work on that-
That was a bunt.
Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela]
[entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.
Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
[on phonne] I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not... [Ryan is dancing feverishly and falls over] Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.
You should've told me.
You're welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.
Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]
Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
[laughs uncontrollably]
Why don't you go with him?
What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary]
Oh... ok.
Yup.
Yeah.
I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
No.
All right, don't break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?
The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things.
Pam? Knock, knock.
Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
Evan, this is Jim.
Let me getcha.
Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face]
[cleaing throat] You're a jerk. Dwight's a jerk!
That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
Me too, me too. Is this wine?
[struggling to speak] Mmm--- mmm...  Um...
No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
Good in bed.
Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been...  Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
it was fun. We had a good time.
[overdramatically] Acting!
Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]
That is how you do it.
I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
I would love a place where we could meet older
Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.
Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
Where?
Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh]
I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
It's okay. It's all right.
By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'
No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...
Oh my God, oh my God.
Yeah.
You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.
[shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up?  [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.
Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.
[singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us...
It's not... Nevermind. Nothing. [arguing voices]
... Oh, God is that today?
Nothing.  Just hangin'.  Chillin'.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?
That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.
No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
Mmm, yeah.
I love you.
I'm a smart guy.  I'll figure it out.
You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
That's a good deal.
That sounds like it was hilarious.
Thanks.
Yeah, you should see her naked.
Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
What about...
The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant.
No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.
[walks up] Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.  How do I look?
Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me.
Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!
Jerk.
Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...
Why do you have a diary?
Make the party.  Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis. [Phyllis starts inflating a balloon with a pump] Pump it!
It's better than I imagined it!
I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
[Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this.
That is ridiculous.
Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.
How?
What are you gonna call him?
I lied to myself too.  I'm not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don't know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.
Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!
Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up!
Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese.
OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
Take hedded of.
Do you understand, you forced my hand?
Excellent.
No.  I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting 'Back to the Future.'  'Back' because it's on my back and 'Future' because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie.
Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
...you just gots to get your freak on.
Thank you very much.
Fantastic!
Yeah, Drew.
You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...
[standing for a while, sighs, turns to walk out] Oh, okay.
Oh my God.
Is it a bird?
[calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.
Milk and sugar.
We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
Wow.  If you wanna cry, that's okay.
No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.
Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. [shows off computer screen scenery] I can also make it the sky.
It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.
Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting!
[board of directors has started to exit] Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. [a few murmurs from the crowd of 'What answers?'] I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -
[Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down]
Pam?
Wow. Really terrific.
Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the 'Amazing Race.' [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?
No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.
Ok, I'll stand near you.
Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. [exclaiming] Oh, stretchin'. I like to stay tight. Compact. [Dwight screaming]
[slightly drunk] What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I gonna stay up all day.  Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO!  And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.
That's what she said!
Okay, go back to the annex.
Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
Uh-huh?
That is neat.
Pam, stand up.
Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]
If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
Stop crying.
Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?
What about our truce?
Yes it is.
Yes.
Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays.
I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.
And do your worst.
Oh no?
Oh...
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
Okay, all right.
Yes.  My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault.  [To Toby] Tell Meredith I said it another time [Toby nods].
Hello, how are you?
Who?
Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
I got thirsty.
Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
No, he's not.
Too expensive.
[Ryan scores] Nice! Come here! [gives Ryan a chest bump]
[on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there?
Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?
Cool.
Of course not.
Yeah.
Right. What?
Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.
[pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...
About what?
Helene?
Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.
No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
Okay.
I'm sorry. [doorbell rings] What now?
Say it with an accent!
Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
Attention, all problem sales persons. Jim Halpert... Dwight Schrute...
It blows. It blows, man. Gah...
Oscar's a douche.
What? Shut up.
This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
I'll be down in just a second. [into house] Holly?
What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
Well...
The pressures of my office are insane.
Do you feel it?
It's all connected. Shut up. [to A.J.] Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'
You are-
I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
Sabre is changing everything. [Michael and David sitting in hot tub] Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?
Not a native speaker.
Michael Scarn.
Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -
Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys. [exclaims] Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?
Up and over.
Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I'd like you to smile. I'd like to see a big smile.
I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?
Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
Are you calling Karen?
[to Jim] What are you doing?
[walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]
I love you, Jan.
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
What?
Do you really mean that?
Who's next?
That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
Don't sell your implants please.
No.
Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.
Do you think I'll get any new ones?  I could... [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight]
No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.
Ahoy. So, how you doin'?
Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag.
Get out.
You cannot say 'I was raped' and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.
May God guide you in your quest.
Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um... she demoted me.
Mmhmm.
[arriving at a dumpy looking, unkempt house] I've never seen this place in the daylight.
Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...
Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
Ohh... OK.
Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
Okay, fine.  Hurry back.
Like it.
Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you...
I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there.
[covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who-- who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  I've never-- I don't know him.  There's another woman.  And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
I think we could. [Donna giggles]
You know what.  I had a great time at prom.  And no one said 'Yes' to that either.
No, the country.
Erin, do we have the journal?
Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I'm not going anywhere.
...you were at the dentist?
Wh-Why not?
Thank you, Kevin.
I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?
This is Scott.
Yeah.
I am going to scare these kids so bad.
Sure. Thanks for asking.
You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!
So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]
Slept like a baby.
You be cool.
Yes, yes.
Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am...
Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.
This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Not.  Good.  Enough!
Do I look okay?
Yes, I am.
Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
I'm...
Here, shake. No!
Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
That got a big laugh.
Well get on it.  And make it happen.
No.  You have to just push it out!
Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
[rapping] I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? [laughs]
Dunder-Mifflin.  It's okay.  [he throws the keys into bushes across the street]  I just did.
Jim.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
Right here.
Okay.
OK. Did everybody get one of these?
In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
Electricity.
I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
Yes, you did.
Probably get soup or something light.
How old are you?
I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.
[whispering] Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away.
I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.
No.  Just ...
I know, I know. You're right, you're right.
You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.
What?
Thank you, Andy.
I got his pants.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
Well-
I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. [Erin laughs] I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
[on microphone] Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.
For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
Stanley, we're havin a little...
Oooh!
No, I want you to pick me up.
No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. [Jan on recording] 'Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.  I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.'  First impressions?
Mmhmm, I'm sorry.
... I asked for trick candles.
Ok.
Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin' tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
OK.
No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
Sure? Might be a good idea.
I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
[laughing] No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?
Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?
Yes I am.
Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
Have a seat.
Boom! Boom!
That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there.
No, I'm sure that's not.  Na...
Why?
Sure we do.
Music...
I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
[in the cheese cart] Be my eyes.
Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
It's the only time he can do it.  2:30 to 3:15.  It's going to be great.  We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.
Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.
Hm?
Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well... [to Brenda] Tell you about Toby later, he's awful.
No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
If it's me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, 'Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?'
We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love...  anyway?  Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar... and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
[Michael answers phone] Yeah.
Expectations....
Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
No.
It's cheaper.
My heart says...
Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
Old fashioned meet market --
Good for him.
Aha! [crashing]
What a tool. [Dwight and Andy exchange looks] What?
Give me the phone.
Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?
Really?
We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.
I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
Some people need dozens of friends to say, 'Hey, look at me, I'm popular.' But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.
Beauty. Thank you sir!
Here.
Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?
Uh oh.
Mmhmm.
Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.
That's good.
And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
Ok. [tries to kiss Jan's hand] Ok, why don't we just step into my office?  We're gonna go in here.
Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?
I am not budging on the hat issue.
Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]
Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, 'That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole...' I dunno, it's a good feeling.
You got that?
No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
[in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
You know.
There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?
This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
Stay-
So we should get the check?
What the hell are you reading to them?
No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?
Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
[laughing] Oh, oh!
Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.'  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
We got beat today, Dwight.
And I was about to take her bra off...
Okay! Calm down.
I'm... what? I didn't
Go bag! Where's my go bag?  Where's my go bag?
I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
[breathing heavy over intercom, starts laughing]
I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
How often can you actually donate blood?
Alright, I'm gonna, uhh, get a cup of coffee.  Do you want some coffee er-
Okay.
Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
[Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael's shoulders] Don't do that.
[singing] Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise...
Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that's it. Keep it in your pants.
WOO!  Alright!
You're the bait for Toby?
OK, yup.
[Grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat] Oh, great.
OK.
Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy's arm with a black marker]
Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem?
So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
Oh...
Yes.
Wow.
Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.
Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.
Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
Don't you work here full-time?
Well.
It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.
[singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
I want you to get the panty liners.
And we are going to straighten this out.
Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
What's that?
I thought your name was Pudge?
Right.
[sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.
[sighing] It was unanimous, Toby.
Say what you said.
Okay.
And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.
[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
You know me very well, Dwight.
It's like a time bomb...
Coat! [throws coat at Pam]
I don't kn--
Good.
Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]
Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside.  Don't... please...
Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!
Hey, what's up.
On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
Keep it up. And there's Stanley. No costume? Well, no, not trying to fit in. I wish I had your confidence, I really do.
Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer]
[nervous laughter] Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?
Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
Yes?
Great work tonight.
I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.
Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. [All groaning]
Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more... than just salaries.  It's about perks.  Like having sex with Jan--
You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
No!
But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
Ah! Ha ha ha!
Okay.
Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. [hangs up] Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...
Keep.
Yes.
No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
Huge?
Yep. [drives off]
A horse.
Go.  Any questions?
Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I'll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That's how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.
Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
Yes.
Yes?
So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
He is I.
[to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want.
They're men, Dwight.
Okay, Okay, we don't have much time.  Just act normal.  Don't look at me people. Stop.  Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me.  Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.  You're older, and you are very happy now.  Because you went with Michael Scott.  Right.  So everybody come on down.  Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright?  Come on!  Are you, are you doing your best here?  Are you being the best that you can be?  [Pam is thinking hard] Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot.  Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me.  Come on Phyllis.  Here we go, here we go!
[phone rings, hits speaker button]
I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
Yes.
Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
It's a heart.
All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.
Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.
OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
There you go.
[answering phone] Yeah?
Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
Both sad.
Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.
You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
Hey, sport.
All right.
Well, kids today have a very short attention span.  They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.  And today they're being distracted by the other booths.
Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.
This is the last
Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -
I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.
[in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.
Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
Okay... Sherri?
Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...
Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
Just making conversation.
Yeah, I do. My word against yours.
Uh, ow.  Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael's behavior]
Is that all you have to say to me?
Ok, ok...
I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
You know, I don't care what he did to me.  He's mean to other people, that's what gets me.  He's just...
Mmm-hmm.  I know.
Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
Your stupid friend zone.
Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
[on video] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles]
I. Understand. Nothing.
He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.
Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
[annoyed] How do you know this?
Why don't you run them again?
I had um, one of those danishes.
[walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
And oh, Jim...
Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
Are you kidding me?  That's my salad.
No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Really?  I don't know.  It's a big third date, Jim.
Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts...
You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. [dials phone]
It was insensitive and I am sorry.
OK. [walks away]
Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth]
Do you see it?
Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
[laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.
You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.
I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right?  I don't know.
Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!
Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.
Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?
Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.
Well...
Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right]
What? Come on. It's time for grapes. [regular voice] Real fun day.
You love it. There ya go.
[Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it's go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?
Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.
They sound great.
Oh. He did? What did he say?
I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured...
It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I don't expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people.  We have fun. [giggles] We just have fun!  Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out.
Yeah.
You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
Very nice.
[laughs] That is awesome.
That's his profit.
Are you kidding me?
Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right!
[voiceover] I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
Well...
I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
Count the last one.
Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
[in video] To Oscar Martinez it's the 'Show Me the Money' award! Yeah!
Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
No is not an option.
Toward the sun.
Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um... Then someone who knows the truth.
Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
Go to your room young lady!
Type O-Ocean Spray.
Ok.
You know what, guys?  It's none of your concern.  It was official business, so just...
So, the copier.
I know.
All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble... jerk stand.
I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.
Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.
It's okay.
[interrupting] No.
What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...
[As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie?
Really? [everybody signifies their agreement, and Kelly gives Michael a piece of cake]  Oh, thanks.
Hey, don't touch him, please!
No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.
What?
No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'
The man has a point.
Oh my God! [sprays champagne on Erin]
What is that?
Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
Pretty nice.
Uh... that I have not decided yet.
... What?
Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
I'm in.
Beat it!
Ugh, forget it.  I'll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!
Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.
NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.
That's great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  [laughs] See?  Everybody has a chance!
Alright. Excuse me. [slides past Eric to close the door to Ryan's closet office before Eric can see Ryan in there] If you will -
The Electric City. Scranton.
[laughing] Ohh, I miss you.
[laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
Oh, that's red eye.
[long exhale]
You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
[misses another shot] What is wrong with me today?!
I am telling Andy.
I started a fire, I started a fire.
Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.
Where's the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.
All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
Charley horse!
All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
I know.
Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
No do it, do it.  I dare you.
[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
I have to hear it from her.
Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.
David?
Who is it? Who's the birthday?
Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
Well...
You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates.
It's gonna be fun.
Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?
...make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don't know. It is a defective ax, my friend.
Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.
There are copies in the bathroom?
Did you pee on a stick?
I-- mmm-- I'm good.
Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing]
Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]
I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop.
No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
[laughing]
Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
Alright, that's the way you want it.
I, uh... [to camera] I let her win.
[singing] Chili's baby back ribs...
Allergies?
Ok, alright, where is Dwight?
In your face
Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.
What is your problem?!
Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.
What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
[mug falls off Michel's desk and smashes on the floor] God... damn it, Dwight! That's great.
Here we go.
Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.
Andy Bernard.
I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
No, it... Yes, okay, right. [erases don't] All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. [writes 'Don't'  in front of symbol]
Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
That's, whatever stupid show you want-
Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.
Oh. [scoffs] Come on.  Be serious.
[staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin'?
Ah, look at me. I'm huge in Wilkes-Barre. Performing nightly, Michael Scott. Not comedy fans here, which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one. Questions? Comment? Can't see you, but I know that you're not breathing. I know you're breathing. Is this on? Hello? 'Well, isn't that... Well, isn't that special?' 'Jell-O pudding.' Bill Cosby. I think Bill Cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he... All the great things they did together as kids. And there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer, and it... And he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it... He would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn't throw it. So... Bill Cosby is smoking! And now some race car. [imitating race car engine] That brings me to my... Brings me to a point that you should always have a list of your clients. It's important to because a client list is next to godliness... List. [baby crying] Could you shut him up, please? I mean, who brings a baby to a sales conference? Really rude.
Yes, it's mine.
Okay.
Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on.
Oh!
OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but...
[as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
[holding broccoli in front of Kevin] Eat it.
You want me to be happy?
Ryan come here!
You sure?
Like... I don't... I don't know.
Excellent!
I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.
Oh.
Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.
[sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.
Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.
You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs]
Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.
Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. [starts singing] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.
It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.
Oh, so you're not gonna play?  She's not playing.
Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
Ah...
Well...
Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.
Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
This smells of fraud to me. This whole thing just kind of stinks.
Andrew, what about you?
I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.
Welcome.
Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
It had to be done, it had to be done.
And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
Yes, Toby?
It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.
Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?
Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic
Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'
...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.
Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat]
That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
Ah.
You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
We're really close.
Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.
I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.
Lethal Weapon?
Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.
Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly?
Meh, exactly.  Eh.
No.
I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can.
Yes, thank you for seeing that.
[English accent] Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.
I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.
Yeah. Quiz me.
What? What?
And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.
[reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'
Because, Dwight... never lies.
Hey, buddy.
Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.
Stop it.
What punch?
Hmm.
Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. 'Too soon for Arabs.' Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court.
No, I am the King bee,
Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
What?
Give it to me.
Jim is her husband.
That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff]
And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
Yeah.
No, no, turn it around.
Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
Do I look like I am joking?
I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house.  Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few.  Very soothing.  [to the interviewer] Want to try?
It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...
I went medieval on his heinie.
[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let's get this movin'. [Dwight goes back to his seat, embarrassed]
Do not talk like that, Stanley.
[sighs] All right.
Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  I'm scared I'm gonna love it.  [claps hands] Let's do this.
You know what? I'll help. I will...
Don't...
Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]
Whatever David wants.
Hey Jo.
Thank you.
Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]
Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I don't know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.  Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.  And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.  I hate her.
[someone coughs] What?
Yeah.
Sorry, my meeting ran late.
Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]
Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
No.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you this, it is
Jim, could you come in here please?
Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
Hello.
Ok. I love it. I love it.
Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
Don't be shy, shy boy. Don't be shy. Get up there.
All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.
Give me the details of how that happened.
Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:
[mouths 'Wow' to the camera]
Oh, god!
No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
This is where we first kissed.
All right, next suggestion.
Yeah--
And it's all inclusive.
[sighs]
I don't feel bad.
Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.
Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
It'll take like two seconds.
Andy?
You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved.
She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing]
Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there.
I can do that.
Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!
Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jim's tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be... .[scrolls down list] No.
Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
We're totally alone.
You may be right. I may be crazy.
Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!
No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
I know.
All right.
Yes!
No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?
Okay!
...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.
Come on, everybody.
But it is already three o'clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names.  If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
Thank you! [gets into his car]
[upset] I don't get it!
Just...
Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five's Stanley]. That's right.
Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
I did it! [exhales]
Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
No. [laughs]
I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted.
Noon.
Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. [looks toward computer] It's trying to stand up... [choking up] there it goes.
Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password.  So...
Going into nuclear something; that's not where the scene was going.
What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
What?
That's possible.
Shh.
No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?
I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.'
Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum]
Here we go.
I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
So, what about you, Angela?  Do you have any single friends?
Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo...
A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
I cannot wait to contact your clients.
China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.  [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.
I had rebound? Yeah.
Good work. [clapping]
That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
[still talking like a robot] I... was just learning... to... love.
There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -
This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
Okay.
Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.
It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!
Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh... Do you have laser tag down there or something?
Oh, already.
Thank you.
Yeah?
I'm creative, Ryan.
Good-bye!
[over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.  Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?
Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
I'm going with Pam's group.
I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
What are you doing?
Come on. A little bit.
[someone knocks] Just pretend we're not here.
Could I be a part of the meeting also?
Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
[sighs] Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what... Why do you care?
A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
Okay!
[imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces.
Ah.  All right.  I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.  But you know what's invaluable is intuition.  You know what that is?  That is the ability to know when something is about to happen.  Does anybody out there have intuition?  Know what's gonna happen next?  Nobody?  Okay, you're going to make me say it.  All right, I am so proud of all of you.  Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?
Ah... .is that all you have to say?
Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
I don't need your permission.
Yes.
Because that is how my mind works.
[on phone] Hello.
You're welcome.
[watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that?
How do you make depression sexy? How do you... How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon... the conun... the conumbery
Look-
Sorry, too busy can't even come to the door.
Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...
[folding his pants on top of the ice machine, man walks in with ice bucket] Why don't you take a picture.  It'll last longer.  God.  Can't I get a little privacy?
Mm, nope. Don't like that.
No. I'm sure.
All right! Cool!
My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much?
When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, 'Michael, I love you, but I can't do this.' But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
I don't need to tell you that.
I will call him later with that message.
It's all... [Pam walks away.] OK.
Pow pow pow... [hands making gunshot impression, sporadic clapping]
[goes up to concierge from the hotel] Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott.  Good to see you again.
And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
[gasps]
Dwight, don't, don't be a suck up.
Here's the door. Here's the door.
No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
No, no, no, no. I have the long sleeve. And actually, you know what we should do? We should wear them tomorrow to work, it'll be hysterical.
I know.
No, no, no.  I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
Uh...
You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.
[from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell.
Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.
Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.
Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one: 'What should we do to prepare for Y2K?'
Oh, okay.
Hi. How are you?
Yes.  'Which can contribute to heart disease.'  Heart disease kills more people that balers.
Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?
What? Really? That stinks!
Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
Look at all them out there, my little worker bees buzzing away.
Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did.
Set!
Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
Ok.
I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
Martin Nash. Okay.
[Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
What?!
Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.
And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!
Well...
I'm asking Pam to do it, please.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
OK, here are your character cards.  Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.  Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.  Everything else is up to your imagination.  So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
I have not found that to be the case.
Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
Wow.  Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.
European offices are naked all the time.
That was a really sucky thing to do.
Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.
OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...
I like, uh...
Very nice.
Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
All-in. [Other players fold their hands]
No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Is there no way we can get rid of him?
Excited to talk ideas.
Uuf, well...
Do you want to hear a lie?
As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.
Gin. [toast, sip]
Yes, big if.
She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You're  lucky you're so darn cute.
You embarrassed us.
Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?
Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-
I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
Brain food. Thank you very much.
Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
Well, I find it beautiful.
He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
Oscar, homosexual accountant.
Weird...
Mmm-hmm.
Is she not going to like that?
[takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie]
Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently]
Thank you.
Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.
Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
Um, no, no. Come on. No. Don't comfort... don't comfort her, that's not... She doesn't need comforting. We're just joking around. I think she's... No that's very unprofessional. I think she's being very unprofessional over there.
That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay? [playing badly] Okay... I'm hearing a little too much reverb. [feedback echoing] Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead. [playing Smoke on the Water] Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?
Da  na na na na.
Love you, as a friend.
Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.
Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.
Yes. God. They're awesome.
Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. [Angela claps] Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget.
Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?
Just-what's going on?
W-why did you...
All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
Yes?
Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  ...  Only on the rarest of occasions...
I agree. He'd land on his feet.
Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.
Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
OK, what else?
Yeah. But one would be good.
You get something good this year?
No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?
I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
All right.
Just do it, okay?
Hey!
OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
David, I did not tell her.
You're so lucky! Good one... [clapping]
An electric car dealership. [Oscar gets up and starts leaving]
Yeah.
OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
And over here..
Really? [Jim shakes his head no]
She washes dogs.
What I want all of you [points at Scranton branch] to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them. Who wants to start? Who wants to give it a shot?
Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
...it happens once every billion years.
Thank you! [Pam hands him blank paper] What, what is this?
No! God! [Jim looks at him oddly]
Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.
Ahhh! Excellent.
So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.
Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
Woo!
[laughs] Um... yes, I'll be right back!
Give me the pointer.
Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
How?
Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl.  I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish]
Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!
Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
[laughs]
And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
Okay.
I think you're right.
Oh, thank you.
Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...
OK.
Sure.
Questions?
Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay. [walking into office] Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.
I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
I don't either.
I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?
I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.
That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.
I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. [turns to reach for pretzel while Second Cindy turns other direction] And... my question to you [points and pulls away other waitress] is do you agree?
Liar!
Love.  Marriage.  Baby carriage.  Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song.  Jan and I had love.  We did not have marriage.  We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.
[the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.
[quietly leaves room]
Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
Oh, good.
I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
Am I too short?
Any questions?
Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
Oh, wow!  Whoa!
Thank you, Stanley.
That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
Oh, ok. Alright.
You kind of have.
Yeah.
How do I explain this to Jan?
Yeah.
[laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly.
Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
They act like I have no power.
The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
No. The monkey!
Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray.
Yes.
[next house] Hey Toby! You suck! [throwing eggs at his house]
Whatever you say babe.
You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!
Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
Mmm... nah, that's too young.
Wow, really?
Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
Toga!
Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
[Elvis voice] Well, thank you... thank you a lot.  And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.
What's the pink?
All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
[knocking] Yeah.
No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
Andy, what time's the show?
Well...
Oh, John Belushi. What a crazy guy. Phew, freaked myself out this morning.
Maybe, I don't know.
I love it more!
Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.  This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.  And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.  Just what the doctor ordered.
Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.
Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.
I'm just kidding. Coconuts for your coconuts!
DEAD.
Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy.
Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
You did?
Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
Well?
Okay
They call it Scranton!
Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
Really? Is she OK?
Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
[nods and shakes hands with David Wallace] Hey, David?
[wearing Ryan's glasses] I'm Facebook.
Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
I don't see a... price.
Nice, Stanley!
Try 'Control P'.
... with coffee but without the haunted.
It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
Dinkin' flicka.
Kevin?
You know what the problem is?
That's very rude.
...between us.
No he did not. I don't need his permission.
So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
Well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction.
Please?
It is always a treat when
Ohh, God!
Check it out.
I can do that, it is my office.
Please?
Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
Absolutely.
Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
[points at Jim] Arrogance.
Ok.
I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn't even me. It's so not fair that they want me to resign.
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
Hey, hey, hey
[on microphone] I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up.
I did?
Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
If the salad is on top, I send it back.
What is Jim telling him?  That I can't handle this job?  That 's bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.
First got priorities.
Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
I, I need something to wipe my hand.
[chuckles] Okay.
All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.
Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
[walking in] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Okay. Alright. Cool.  See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby's desk] Oh, she's cute.  Cutie-pie. Back to work.
I mean you can tell.
Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. [gets jacket] I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. [pushes chair as he leaves]
Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
It's been opened.
Jim, we're getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.
I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don't think that's too much to ask.
Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
Ugh.
[shouts from behind the trees] Uh, it's a sketch now.
Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?
Do you remember Ed Truck?
So you wanna? Thanks.
You shouldn't have been, 'cause you were dealing with Michael Scarn.  That was exactly what I was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that's a compliment.
What?
Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.
Why do you think that? You just immediately go to that, Dwight? Why are you so negative? Why...
Like, with who?
Oh, what are you usually?
Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
Very perfect. [girl walks away, Michael laughs] Oh my [notices Dwight making out with Tall Girl #1] This needs to be shared. [takes a picture with his camera phone] [Cut to the office - All Office co-workers cell phones go off. They notice the picture Michael has sent and all groan]
Yep.
Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
You are.  You are.
I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...
How so, specifically?
Could I count myself down please, Dwight. Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested. [pounds the elevator button] Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?
You look great.
Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?
Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let's get this started.
Really?
Where is my cornbread?
Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
Do you want the raise or what?
Why are you helping her?  You're not even dating.'  She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...
Ohh..
Hmm.
Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.
No, you don't have to do that.
When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
Do you love him now?
Stanley! Bo banley.
I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.
Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, 'only the best and the brightest.'
I could go for an appeteaser.
[shouting] Toby, just do it! God!
[just hugs her, and she hugs him back and smiles] You wanna go out?
I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.
Well-
No, no, not real bombs.
Hey. Wow.
Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
Ok, I have an announcement.
Well...
Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
No.
[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
Don't ape me.
Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. [laughs] Okay.
Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight. You're... it's, it's bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one.
Yeah.
Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?
All right, well, go find some.  Get outa here, please. [Dwight sighs and leaves]
Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
Acrimonious.
All right, um... sorry.
Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
[on Jo's jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.
Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.
She's Pam's best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?
Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
Nobody cares what you think.
I just want you know, you've been a big disappointment to me today, okay.
Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
Ryan is causing some problems.  And you were always good at handling him.  What should I do to control him?
If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?
Really? What did they say? 'For a good time, call Michael Scott'?
[holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time.
Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
Yeah, she does all that.
This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
Yes.
O-kay. Hello Jan.
Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like 'What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.'
Uh-huh.
Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?
Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.
These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
Oh, hi.
Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
Mmmhmm. Yes.
Just don't say no.
[reluctantly] Yeah ...
Ahhh.
[deep sigh] There could be others...  I need to know.  I don't want to offend anybody else.
Of course. You're always working hard.
What am I supposed to do here?
Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...
Why didn't you just say that, Pam?
Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.
You might take something.
[removing tie] Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything. [puts on backwards golf cap]
Oh, after you.
Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry.
Ah. A ten inch black and white?
Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies
Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?
With that I can buy... half the menu.
Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Yep. Yeah, she's up front.
[reading off piece of paper] Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison.  But we zoom back further---
There's no way I'm gonna do that.
Apollo Creed.
...Or biologically.
No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.
You are a liar.
Cooper's.
We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.
Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
Yeah, do it!
We have a history...
Eh.
Can you send Dwight in here?
Okay.
O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?
You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]
Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.
Oh!
You've got it, you've got it.
Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. 'You can't be on the team', 'You can't move on to second grade'. Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
[deeper] Da  na na na na.
So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
What... can I do, for you?
I will grab you here anyway. [laughs]
Very nice.
Dwight, they called your name.
[unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
[as Mikanos] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you. [exits conference room] [normal voice] All, you have to close right now.
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive [Andy joins in] Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
They are correct, sir.
Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is...
I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
What?
Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?
Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that?
Everybody, except Stanley.
Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
What is a sales department? Oscar, what do you think?
Let go, please. Just gimmee -
Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
That's it!
No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...
No--- We're all unstable.
Well, what should I do?
I... That was just...
[points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little 'Good Will Hunting' situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.
[enters] [in a gruff voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not...
What?
What did I say?
You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
I got you... jade earrings.
All right, Andy, please.
...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
Where'd you eat?
Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...
The office.
Um, come on.
Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
[outside opening Gabe's cable hookup box] Okay... Alright.
What if she makes me?
[answers cell] What do you want?
Hey...
Yes it was.
Wow!
Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
You can get up.  Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, bitch.  [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace]
That's so spicy.
Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
No.  There's a lot I haven't done.
God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
Who's there?
What about her looks?
Nice to meet you.
She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.'
[pats face] Oh that feels better.
Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
And - [Jim seals box with tape, rips covered with stickers] Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. [cell phone starts ringing from inside box]
Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
HR stuff? [pulls up a chair] HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley. [pointing to Eric's notes] What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.
Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
Kind of in the middle of something here.
...contemporary townhouse. Two car parking...
Hey Mer. How ya doing?
Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
Woo hoo! [climbs on desk, stage dives into crowd of employees]
I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  [throws money at Phyllis] There you go.  There's some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.
I don't know about that.
Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of 'em.
When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-
Hello.
Mhhmm! We would be married.
Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.
Who?
yeah!
Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate...
No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy.  Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing.  I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words.  That's her fault.
I have my per diem. [holds up money] I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater.
Thank you.
Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.
Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.
Yes...
Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.
I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs]
Hey, you. Big Jim. And Phyllis. Working hard, Phyllis?
He's going to swallow is tongue.
They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
Oh, yuck. [spits out food]
I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
Yes, I do.
Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
[at same time as Pam] 4-9-1-7-4-5-1
OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what...
Oh.
[singsong] Just-in time.
Ouchy.
Roy said the first one didn't count.
Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! [giggles]
As my associate.
Oh, that looks good.
Yeah.
The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.
Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?
You can't have it.
I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.
Okay.
I'm going in for a procedure today.
I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
I just went out for a walk.
That was hilarious. The foam ...
Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.
MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
[getting off his stomach] Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. [picking up a portable tape player] Let's try this. Put these on. [DeAngelo puts the headphones in] I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- [DeAngelo winces] That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, [gives him a card] and make it sound perfect.
You're kidding.
You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Jan called me about your little meeting!
Push free play til tomorrow morning. [to Grotti] Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.
I... won't.   I won't.
We could do a movie... sort of thing.
AHHHH!
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
You're thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?
Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
Thank you.
I... will skip a turn.
Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
OK.
Alright.
I don't know that.
Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision.
There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it---  And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.
I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart.' I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, 'Mr. Brown,' he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.
No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about?
Hey, look! I'm king of the world!
Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
[Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!
I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?
You still don't know.
You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, 'How could they do this to us?'
I think I know where he is.
Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
Thanks.
Yes, what else?
Oh, okay.
Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
Just something I have to do first.
Ok.
Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
Here we go.
Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?
Sure you don't want to come?
[shakes head] Can't stop.
is a guy that...
Oh, hey, do you still work here?
No.
Exactly.  Here, here are my sure things.  I blindfold her.  I take her to the Houdini Museum.  She chains me up...
I will go first.  When I discovered
Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.' This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
We're making love!
[sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?
It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.
Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.
I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?
Yeeesh.
Pssh, kay.
Uh, [in a nerdy voice] 'I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.'
What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
Work it out amongst your selves!
Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?
Yes.
Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
Yes?
[handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.
You suck!
Show time! It's show time!
I don't know, same old stuff.  Same old.  Boss just been ridin' my ass.
Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
Oh.
I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!
OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
Cool. What next? [Dwight puts his face on scanner]
I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?
What are you doing?
Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?
No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
Billy, your nurse is hot.
I do understand it.
Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
People work faster after...
No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]
What's a Nazi?
Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn't go in there.  I'm pretty busy, I should just...
[follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That's insane.
OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...
How many is that?
Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael's phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales.
Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
No, I'm first mate. You're second mate. I'm first mate, as the captain.
I  love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.
All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...
I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.
Da  na na na na.
[sitting on Oscar's desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...
Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so...
Alright!
What are you talking about?
Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
I'm his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
Oh, my God. Dwight.
Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
What shape?
No problem. Worth a try.
It is not your business, Dwight.
Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
That's good.
Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?
Close them.
Did you see Holly's butt?
Yup.
It's frontward's.
We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!
Let's go!
Hi Donna. It's Michael.
Umm, nacho chips.
Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.
Nice to have Oscar back.
Um...
My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.
T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame.
Hey.
Ok.
And Cinco de Mayo.
I don't know about that.
What is that smaller stripper holding?
And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.
OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
[to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
I will call you when it is time. [Jim and Dwight leave]
How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger.
It was an accident.
That's-
You... are... kidding me.
Paper money. [clears throat] Yeah. The company's doing fine.
That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
No. No. That's not how it works.
There's gonna be a free room?
Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles]
That's over several months, Ryan.
[holding up a Dundie and pretending it is talking] Hello. I'm Michael Scott. I'm the best boss in the world.
Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.
Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.
What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?
La la la, hello Oscar!
Do you know anybody in the mob?
I can't get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.
Toaster Oven 101?
No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.
Uh huh...
After breakfast.
Shhh... just calm down.
Sound good. Sounds fun.
Or Ryan Stiles, something like that.
Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don't believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.
No... you're crazy.
Just sit down Kelly.
She will have a greekaccino.
Well, yeah.
Which will be fine. I am off!
Yes.
No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.
Hey, Jan. How you doing?
Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
I thought that you were engaged?
Find out whose car that is.  If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
...all fixtures included. Yes, this is... This is looking good.
I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
I Braveheart.  I am.
[standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
[normal voice] I'm not the godfather.
It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
No.  Not a giant net.
Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...
Where did you get your outfit?
Oh, good. Okay. Don't tell me, tell them.
Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
OH GOD!
...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You're going to know them for the rest of your life.
It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!'
When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone.
You're back. What happened?
Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?
Hey.
No, no no.
Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
Oh, I know your hero. Yeah, saving you from Animal Planet Jack over there. [laughs]
No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
Okey doke.
Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?
And you think that'd be sexy?
Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch.
Yes.
Don't patronize me, Pam.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.
If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably 'freedom.' At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.
No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. [turns around, takes bandanna off] So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?
[in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
I could not have agreed with you more.
Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
What do we know about him? He's an accountant.
Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
Ignore him.  You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...
It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  [sees man in a turban outside] Oh my God. Ohhh. [dials phone number] Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.  Oh, we have a serious problem here. [goes out onto office floor] Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.  Pretend you're not here.
Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
[accent] Oh, you startled me.  My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can I do you for?
Yehhhehh.
Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
Any emails today?
Yeah, yeah.
I don't like that story babe.
Rock and roll. [they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone]
Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]
Just...
You bet your fat ass we are.
Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-
Do what?
What do I do?
Yes, yes.  But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
Okay.
Okay.
Hey! Hi, good to see you.
Good to see you.  Where's your saxaphone?
They're in a whorehouse.
Sure you can't stay a little longer?
Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
[singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back [Christian laughs]
No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'
Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
No, you don't even know what stupid is.  It's about to get all stupid up in here.
Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why don't you have a seat?  [Phyllis sits] Let's all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok!  [in Michael Clump voice]  When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.  [kneels down in front of Kelly, Dwight tries to help him down, Michael shouts gibberish at him]  Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair.  Come on, stand up on your chair.  Stand up, stand up, stand up.  Somebody help her.  Here we go. [Kelly stands up on her chair] Ok, I want you to look at her.  She's a beautiful Indian woman.  Why?  What makes her beautiful?
So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
Well, I think I can get through the door.
I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.
Uh, duh.
Pop quiz.
So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
Babe alert! [to the redhead]  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
Yes?
You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
I know.
Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.
Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
No, no no no no.
[puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.
I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don't have to convince me.
Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.'  It's code.  She'll know what it means.
What?
No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...
Shhhh! Keep it down.
Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
Oh, alright, yeah.
No, King is higher. Then Ace. I am the Ace bee.
I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible.
All right. All right. Bye.
Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
Drinks are on me!
We did?
Ok, alright I gotta go.
You need the big guns, yes?
Find a key.
Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?
I don't understand.
You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..
So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.
All right.
Oh, no, no, no.  You're good.  It was clerical.  You're good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
[lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.
Yeah.
No.
No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
I can just continue to run it myself.
Oh, umm... [looks at Post-It on computer]
What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
No. Dwight. I'm fine.
Sure. You like Cosmos?
[misses a half court shot] Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. [Dwight scores] Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go.
Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, 'Hey, did you get an award?' And the neighbor will say, 'No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me.' Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...
This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
No, no, no, I finished all of that.  I'm very fast.  I'm not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am.  But I do say thank ya ma'am.  But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam.  Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam.  If it's consensual.  [cold Jan stare]  We're talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?
Yeah. I am.
Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
I'll see you later.
What do you race cars?
Uh, nine.
Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
Pretty weird. [Dwight and tall girl run out of club]
Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.
Yeah.
There they are. What's up? Hey hey.
Kill me... right now.
Something is wrong with you.
Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri.
OK.
[walks into Toby's office] Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?
[holding up his 'World's Best Boss Mug'] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.
Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.
Well, this is a work related matter.
Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.
Yep.
Hi.
So that's it.
That's what I'm talking about!
...And products!
Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.
There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. [Dwight leaves] Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.
About dressing your best today?
Yes we do.
Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
I don't understand why you're so upset.
Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
Really? [cheers, applause] Thank you. All right.
Pam, please clear my phone lines.
[on microphone] Andy had Erin.
I don't know.
Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that...
You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
I have a special assignment for you.
Don't...
Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.
Your kidding?!
And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
[in his car with Erin driving to lunch] Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
[very excited] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.
Dwight does not play a robot.
It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?
Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
$645.00
Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them.
Really?  Would you do that?
Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
Did Darryl touch you?
Well...
What?
I'm not.  It's solitaire.  See?
Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
...Jim.
Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates]
Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it's time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?
Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]
I have a laundry machine!
The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.
Well then I won't get a warrantee.
[sighs] It's not ready yet.
Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can't do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.
[exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
I can't even say it. H-I...
So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
What's that, pipsqueak?
Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
I am a grown-up, Jim.
Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.
I know where this is goin'.
No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
Yes.
How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.
Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.
No!  No-- no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
Twenty years.
I said 'was'.
That's my joke, damnit Dwight.
What are you doing?
I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. [covers Meredith's face with his jacket] You are now sexy in your culture.
...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]
Yes, for dramatic affect.
Okay.
You guys excited about the party?
She already has a stroller.
That's the whole point, dummy.
Yes, I am.  It's very sad.  Because he was my boss.
Yes... just go--
[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?
I spy?
Good. Good, good, good. That's good. Now see, that's not so hard, right? All right. Who's next? Who are we going to... Ryan. Ryan's next.
Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!
Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah?
Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.
Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
Ok, what kinda machine is that?
Why did you do that?
Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.
There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. [spinning in chair] He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
Mmhmm.
Can't we all get along?  No, we can't. But here's the thing: yes, we can. Well, why not? Because of differeneces. Well, can we overcome these differences?  No. Can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences? No, we can't. But, we have to try and that is why I created the Integration Celebration.
Waa... what? What are you talking about?
I will divide and then count to it.
That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
Kahlua Sombrero, please.
Excuse me, everyone... SEX! Now that I have your attention...
Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business.
You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
In terms of land, not population.
[on karaoke microphone] Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
All of us?
If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
Stanley, gotta play hurt.
Good luck.
Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.
1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. [applause] Nicely done.
Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.
Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?
I made it with my cheese pita.
You would not believe what happened here.
I don't know what I'm gonna do!
And they are having problems, so sh...
Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!
One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar...
I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...
Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
Stupid.
No.
You gotta crack these things open.
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
Mm-hmm.
It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
We did it!
Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.
What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
What?
What? What?
[makes grunt in attempt to stop Dwight. Dwight hangs up]
Christ Almighty.
Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...
What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
Are you talking to me?
No, no no no... No, no.
I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
I am not paying for that membership.
Oh, and I'm not?  Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun?  You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you?  I'm workin' for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what we're gonna do.  I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good?
Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? 'Raging Bull.' Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. [Michael opens his blinds and looks at Ryan in the parking lot] There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. [Calls Ryan on the phone, Ryan doesn't pick up after seeing that Michael is calling] Oh, we're playing phone tag.
Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
How long is it?
Beep! Bop!
I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.
The 'Spicy Curry' award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go.
Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. 'Old School'.
Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We're going now!
Really?
Do you fast food?
Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?
[walking into Darryl's office] Darryl!
Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
That is a good point.
Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.
What?
Sounds good. OK, alright.
Okay. Okay. 'Achey Breaky Fart.'
Hello. [comes in carrying 4 gallons of orange juice and his water bottle] Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.
Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table]
What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
Okay, I believe you, I believe you.
Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
So, you will?
Don't drink all of it.  Give some to Oscar.
Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?
Ahhhh...
Why quick?
And now, presenting...
I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: 'Holly, you and I are soup snakes.' The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!
Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
Yeah.
Yes. Homelessness. What?
Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
It's whoever, not whomever.
[on speakerphone] David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
Who's Michael?  I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.
Cake? Who suggested cake? [Angela points to Phyllis]
...awesome.
Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...
I can do this.
[into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
What's up-dog?
I'll call him. I'll call David.
You know you did.
I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
[scoofs] I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
Still not seeing the problem here.
I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
Everybody enjoying their meal?
You listen to me. You listen good. You are are
David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
That's true.  People say it's icky.
Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
Why?
I'm not just a middle... man...
I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
Oh, you're sorry?
So I think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be [starts to fan out the rest of his cards facing the group showing kings of hearts] a king of hearts.
[hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them.
Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us. [in a Mexican accent] Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
That's true.
I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
[laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... 'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'
On. Just put it on.
What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...
Why are you here?
Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.
Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
You're welcome.
You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]
Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.
Oh okay.  I don't know how those got on there...
You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
[laughing] What was that?
It was a good idea, though.
That's what faggie means!
What old days? What are you talking about?
Alright, everybody here?  Yes.
Oh, no, no. No. Don't-
Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.
That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
... Dwight, they embarrassed us...
Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
Who is this?  How did you get this number?
I do. Both of them.
No... [they kiss again]
What?  Part of your duties are to what?
[sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
[to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.
And the sequel, 'Woman Stands at Desk and Works.' So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that.
Who quits?
Here we go. Everybody on.
No. OK. Um, the last word is 'seagulls.'
No.  It doesn't.  I'll find out tonight.
What?
Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.
Well, thats...
[interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
You have big plans for tonight?
[in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big]: AIDS.
Beard.
What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
Yeah, I know when it's from, Ryan.
Per-diem. [singing as he signs] Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm! [shows off $100 bill to Ryan] You know, Ryan, it's all about the Benjamins.
Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.
Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.
Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
Kevin, I have something for you.
Could you send her in?
New York.  Wanna go?
Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! [gets in backseat] Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
Nothing.  I wrote 'bringing someone to the hospital'.
Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
Ok yes, I would never do that.
Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed. [slams on breaks, camera turns, Meredith rolls off the hood]
How about this weekend?
...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!
Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?
You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
Really? What happened?
[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?
You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---
Whassup!
Blech.
Hello, Holly.
All right!  Martha Stewart!  You can be Martha Stewart's receptionist!  Very good!  I will be tea baggin' it.  Nn... no.
Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  [knock on the door]  Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We're going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
Agreed?
Don't touch me this time.
[Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who's Pat?
Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?
Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes.
Who's gonna start. How about Phyllis? You kick us off and then we'll move around. Go ahead.
Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]
Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse.
[on the phone] Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he's a little... Little dim. He's the janitor's brother, so...
Years!
What did you just thought?
Yes.
Exactly that.
Nuhh...
Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?
[throws the sack of garbage onto the floor] Eight Years.
Aw, my car.
I think so.
I want you to get your ass out of my face.
For you, job well done.
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
Now is really not the time, Meredith.
Ok, alright.
Get in here... everybody.
I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]
You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
It's a fish.
Well, I'm texting him, so.
Hi.
How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
Thanks Jim.
Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
Or sooner.
Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge]
[counting cash] Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... [moves money after seeing workmen walk by] ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
So this is our sales staff. They are the ones who are making calls and making us lots of money. [comes to a screeching halt and laughs] This is accounting. The numbers dudes. Do not let the job description fool you, they are all completely crazy. Especially that guy, he is a mental patient. [camera zooms in on Kevin] Not literally of course, that wouldn't work. The last place you'd want somebody like that is accounting. [hides behind office plant] 'Very interesting, but stupid.' Artie Johnson. It's a crazy place.
You never know about the press.
No, you are.
Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? [classical piano playing] [violin playing]
I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed.
Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
Very nice! [Borat voice]
So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
Okay, yeah.
Yeah.
In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.
They are not.  Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up]  That's my girlfriend.
Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
Anything your heart desires.
Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
Oh, wow. He...
Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
...who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
It looks cute though.
[pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
Y-You can-Michael.
No. I said I hate the, the style.
Okay.  I promise.  [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps]
I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, that's for sure.  It'll probably be on a boat.
No, I'm whipping them.
You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
[loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt. [Phyllis gets up and leaves the party]
Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
That's just an arbitrary title.
Oh, OK.
Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'
Kelly?
Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.
Don't let us down.
I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.
Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.
Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
That was embarrassing.
No!! Come on, gimme something good!
But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
Pam, really, they're back?
Just keep pushing...
Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six. [later in his office, places a band-aid over his cold sore]
I'm taking one for my lady friend.
Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.
[leaving his office with his rum] Night everyone.  Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.
I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...
Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot.
Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
Okay.
[turns to address Jim and Pam] No way.
No, You're not going to collect them.
Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
-- I don't think it is.
You called Bob?
You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
Yes you do.
Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?
I know, it's very, very personal...
They did this up in Albany...
He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.
Any messages for 308? All right.
Oh. You were forbidden.
Is it?
Oh, there we go.
Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Alright.
I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible. [slams phone on desk, phone breaks]
January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this.
Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
Well that goes without saying.
Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. [Kevin sits on his lap. It's a struggle] Oh my God.
[others  start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm... whoa.
Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.
Crystal.
[opening blinds as Stanley walks past] Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?
I'll just wave and introduce myself.
Hey, doc?  You forgetting something? [pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to Michael]  Thank you.
Well it sounds right, but is it?
Hi.
[Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you?
Where?
No, it's just us.
All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.
No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
Awesome.
Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?
No, we know. Texas!
Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
Well...
Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I'm okay. No, I'm not.
Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.
It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
Morning Dwight.
Okay shut up.
I didn't say it, I declared it.
Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
Hey, you know what?  Coincidence - I am going to go for a little stroll myself.  Are you psyched about the summer?
When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
[while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families.
Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.
I think you're a nice guy too.
Hmm...
Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
Are you all afwaid?
Hmm.
Yes, I am.
What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.
Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
[Michael is singing to the tune of 'Tiny Dancer' by Elton John] 'You have won a tiny Dundie.'
Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]
I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
No, no, ridiculous.
Your body only has a certain amount.
Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. [camera shows Devon sitting outside with West Nile]
Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.
Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.
Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
I'm in. I'm in. Here we go. [Lonny gets around Michael to score and he ends up in front of Phyllis] Zone, Phyllis! We're playing zone!
Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that's...
All right.
Rock n' roll!
What the hell is that?
Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it.
No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.
[imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs]
Wow. Things are really picking up.
Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
Wow.
Stop talking.
Hey.
And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
No, I don't!
Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
Come on!
Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
What are you?
They're good [Donna grabs mint]
Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...
Um.
I'm not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with.  Just fun, healthy young woman.
Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs]
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
400, 400 hey batter batter.
All right!
Sales.
One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--
I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.
Place is packed.
A woman spurned.
Yeeesh.
Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
Dwight, please, please.
I just... it's terrifying.
Oh, does he?
See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
Oh... kay.
W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
No it ain't.
At a gas station?
[standing way too close to Jim and Pam] Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. [Jim and Pam stop kissing]
That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot... [Jan glares at Michael] ...of water.
I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
All right, we're starting over.
Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'
Uhhgh.
I do too.
Yes, I will not be.
P-A-M. P-A
[long pause] Yes.
[sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Really loud.
So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo's phone vibrates]
Whoa. What are those stains?
Stanley, you don't need to answer that.
No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we --[Dwight counts the raised hands] Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
I understand. We're all friends.
[to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.
[teen approaches table] Hello there.
Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
Okay, okay.  Who could do music?
Mmm!  It's after midnight. [points at Jim]
Oh, yeah right.
Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant?  That's...
No. No. No.
Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
[singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
It's none of your business.
Okay.
Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
No? okay, fine.
You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.
Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.
Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.
Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
Hey guys.
Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
I know, I know.
I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
Top of the Sunday morning to you.
I am the fat accountant.
[on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry.
Cool, so maybe hook me up  with some Fleebulls and some Hive.
Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]
Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.
Is somebody there?
...kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
Damn it.
Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
Okay. All right.
That would be bad.
And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
I'm scared, too.
Good.
Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.
Oh, Pam with the dirty talk. [laughs]
I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.
I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. [throws pizza dough, hits the ceiling]
Wow!
I don't want Dwight!
We have been friends forever, right?
You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.
Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.
Okay, oh! All right.
I'm not your lover! I'm am not Michael Scott, I am Dr. Bergerstein. Your proctologist.
Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a 'Where's Waldo.' [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]
It's a sophisticated take.
Most do in the magazines.
You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.
Hello.
Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun.
Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.
Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]
Thank you.
And we are prepared to reject that offer.
I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?
Right? [laughs]
Not just because he said it?
Do some... do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
There is stink in there, my God!  What is... what is that?
Damn it.
Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
Why would we do that?
Okay. Well. Live strong.
I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
Okay.
I think maybe Hank should be here.
Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.
Pass.
Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance...
Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? [phone rings] Heh-woh you.
Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?
Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
I totally agree with you.  But I don't have money problems, I don't.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]
[Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how we're gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.
There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.
Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
Hold on, Holly's coming back here?
Just don't let him sit on you...  I'm kidding.  You'll have fun.  It'll be good.  It'll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.
[doing impression] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.
You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]
You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-'
To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
Ener-gize...
Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
Right there. The coach!
Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
Hello, Stanley.
Where do you wanna go?
9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE: log. Lost log. Found log.' '10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points.' That's on the wrong page.
What?
Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant.
Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
Hey, I'd rather kill myself.
That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.
I didn't say anything!
Hey, hey, hey.
[walks into park with Dwight] Hi stranger! Long time!
Get in there!
I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.
Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?
Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.
For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.
Okay, then I want Pam back.
Didn't move my lips.
[mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office]
Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
Yes! Yes! All right. We got game!
Great
I'm cool.
Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
I didn't mean me!
I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
Call a client right now.
Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.
Okay.
I don't think there's any stronger choice than being a really strong character.
He's in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
[to Holly] Can't set 'em up like that.
Stanley. [off camera]
I think this is going great.
Next-ish.
It's a big red trash compactor!
I... really want to keep you.
Well, we don't--
Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.
It rained.
...what?
Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
Stephanie could you hop off please?
Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other]
Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
Hello.  Scott.  Table for four.
First sentence is: 'I'm a proctologist'.
You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
Idiot.
[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
Oh my God! What if I did?
Hi, honey.  You holding up?
Ok.
Okay. Wait, what?
Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
That makes sense because he has elfish features.
...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
Let's do it!  Drop that sucker.
Yeah! [office erupts in cheers and applause and hugs] It's a Christmas miracle!
OK, I'll take it. [misses free throw] OK.
We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.
[sighs] Let's call him and get the website.
You mad? You mad at me?
I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.
Oh! I don't know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.
And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
[unwraps rum gift] Oh, wow.
Okay.
Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
Aww, really?
Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.
Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
Ugh.
Ronnie was bleh.  Things were at an all time sad here.  But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town.  And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard.  Give him to me.  I want him.  I need him.
[cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
So...
You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
[pulls Toby's pants down] Beow!
Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
Huh?  He might do it...
Jim? Are you?
Would someone just make the copy?
Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
[knocks on door] Hello, hello!
Well, yeah, but you don't need the brochure.  The brochure is up here [indicates head] and it's in here. [indicates heart]
Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Oh God!
Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
But before that, I have to do my presentation.
And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.
And still rockin', Oscar.  One of the greatest all-time oldies was a little Oriental guy named Confucius.  He literally invented the ancient Chinese secret.  Here's some of his quotes.  Confucius say, 'Man who farts in church must sit in his own pew.'  Confucius say, 'Man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day.'  Confucius also say, 'Virgin like balloon.  One prick, all gone!'
I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.
Thank you.
[after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?
Hilarious. Hey.
Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have.
Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.
A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?
No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke.
They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
Dammit, Oscar!
[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
Pam, everybody! [starts clapping]
OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.
Uh...
But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
And dental this time.
What was that?
Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.
Woo!  Shotgun!
Pro.
Hey.
Here's a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway. [Man steps back inside his house and shuts the front door] All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool.
I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.
What?
Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
Morning.
Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
Oh, wow, so quickly.
[holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable.
Kev...  Nice.  Going.
I will do all the talking.
I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, it's good for me.  It's the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it.  I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.
All right!
[on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
Yeah?
OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's]
I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
No, this is a power suit.
Mm hmm .
You know what?  I would love a slice of real New York style pizza.
[looking at Creed] Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go. [lifting the car seat high above his head] Lion King!
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
Damn it.
No. What is his name?
Hey, congrats on the bonus.
[laughs] What?
What are... That's insane.
Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
Really? We're good?
Ahh, ooh!
Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually. [pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them]  There you go.  Use it in good health.
Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know?  It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok.  Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
What does warm mean?
It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
Don't get hysterical.
Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!
Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.
What are you doing?
Pam?
Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.
Ah, fine.
So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don't care.
I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry.
Maybe.
Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.
Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.
Before we continue, I would like to make an opening statement.
[talking over Jim] He's fat. The fat accountant award.
What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?' Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.
Jan in yet?
Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
Here he is.
You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
Look...
Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam.  It's about attitude.
That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
[Kelly singing] Hey! Hey! Stop your mouth, please.
Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?
Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.
Well I believe in love at first sight.
Oh my God! That's it! That's it!
Yeah. Maybe next year.
This is an inflatable sumo suit. [blows] Now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.  Well, times have changed. [blows] And it's not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.  It's about who is the best boss.  And I don't even care who wins. [blows] It's how they wrestle in a blow-up suit... [breathes in] that will tell me all I need to know [blows] or how sumo... [collapses]
[performs magic-tricks while lip-syncing]
Oh. Bad boy. [to Ryan] Um... Ryan? [makes Donald Duck noise]
That's insane.  We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
[in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.
[on his cell phone] Hey, hey Craigers, my man! It is Michael Scott here. [silence] Dunder Mifflin, we supply your office paper.
[listening to his head] What?
[Angela enters Michael's office] Ah.
I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
Yeah.
Pam, please?  I have Country Crock.
Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face]
I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.
Yes, yes. Assistant to  the regional manager.
Is Gould dead?  What uh-
Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob]  You guys are going so slow...
What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  She's my ex-lover!  ...ish.
Yo soy Cancun.
[in an old man mobster voice] Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over.
I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
I said no.
Hey, you don't deserve her.
And here we have 'Mister Roger's Neighborhood.' Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.
It was a lot of snap decisions.
Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
An age or month?
Hey.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
Wow. High score?
Well we can do better than that.
What?
No.
I did!
And I've never gone hang-gliding.  And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]
Wow, that sounds so... warm.
Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Oh my God.
No.
Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.
Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
Now you sound like Kermit.
Yeah.
Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
[to Kelly] I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here.
You're welcome.
You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
Next person on the...
[sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding.
Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Men's Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  I'd like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make 'em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  'Hello, I'm Michael.  Welcome to Men's Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today.' ... This is one example.
No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.
Sum it up Darryl, sum it up.
My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international.  The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...
You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...
I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at-- [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that's... [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
So, you uh, see the Sixers game last night?
See you later!
Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!
Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vagina! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael]
Uh, just a few more items.
I don't have a girlfriend.
[through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
Thirty.
I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]
That's, yep a little flimsy. Umm... OK... Ahh... Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.
What up?
You should get out of them.
[grabs different remote from the table] Well I will turn up the volume.
Okay. What do you think?
It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don't remember in which direction.
[as Mikanos] Hello.
I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...
Okay.
[fumbling for words] Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
Yes, please.
[sighs] How can he still not know?
The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That's how  the game's played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
Wait, you still don't know...
[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]
[at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...
Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
What the hell is a terrarium?
No.
Answer the door.
It's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can...
Stop.
See you later. [hugs Wallace]
Oh!
Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.
And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
Good.
Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
Okay. [passes Jim some index cards]
Stop it! Stop it!
...Absolutely not.
I was thinking exactly the same thing.
Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.
Would you have sex with Meredith?
Let's see...
Yes, I am. Are you?
Just trying to be your friend.
Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
Hey, hey.
Like you're applying for a loan.
Don't. Please don't say anything. [sighs] Oh, God.
I have done things like um, 'Beers in Heaven.'
That... exists?
Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
Well, yeah, I mean, what is...
Leaving Pennsylvania.
[wandering around the room during his diversity exercise] I want you to push it. I want you to push 'cause breakthroughs are right around the corner. Something's going to pop here. Something's going to pop between a party. Feel what it's like to be in someone else's skin. What does it feel like to be a different race? It feels pretty bad doesn't it. So let that come out.
Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim's pass] Whoa!
Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And they're done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn't translate.
You're a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.
Hey, right?
Good. All right. [everyone leaves]
Well, please?  I won't tell anybody.
Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Threat neutralized.
Let's go mini-golfing.
We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.
See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
Don't... I...
He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
Thank you.
Hello.  I've seen you guys around.  I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?  [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here?  I need to purchase something.
Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
Yes, definitely.
It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
Yes.
Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?
Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.
Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
It's bad.
Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.
Well, this...
Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.
Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath - looks at camera] Yeah, okay.
And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.
Oh, well.
Friends fight. Friends fight.
Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'
No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]
I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun
Ach! Wuh---
You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
Well, you kept-
Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?
I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. [puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt] Berp.
And the neighbors blamed Jan.
Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.
Wow!  What happened in there?
Just amongst ourselves.
Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?
Did you?
Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
Ahh, that's mine.
Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
Uhhh... nothing.
Uh, that's what she said.  See, haven't lost my sense of humor.  No, no need, it was a non-stick grill.
Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time.  It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be torture for you.
Everyone, now [bleep] calm down!
Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
Yes, indeed.
Yes.
Ah, still early.
No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 2:30 to 3:15.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guy's night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.
Unbelievable! Unbelievable.
Hey, Julie! You having fun? [Julie leaves]
Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?
Strawberries?
Whatever, yeah.
No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
Not. I said, not that.
How's it going?
[Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your---
What?
Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
All right. That's looking good. Hey um, Ryan do you have any music I can borrow.
Yeah.
Okay...
I will seduce her.
You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
[clearing throat noise] Idiot. Dwight's an idiot! Did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it?
Uh, Jan, what happened?
What? What I'm saying...
Ok, be more specific.
That would be sublime.
Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
She's your wife, you idiot.
[wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.
He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.
With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.
No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.
No, we have to cancel the party.
Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.
Oh my God.
Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or...
So this is Astird.
[sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...
Not about taking credit.  Let's just say we all did it.
Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.
Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
This is Tito.
No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps]
Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
That sounds good. Thank you.
No, neither am I. We both look good.
Rock it!
Okay, bye bye.
No.
No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
Are you going to kill me?
Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme...
Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. [sighs]
Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]
Dwight, what is the traffic like?
Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. [Jim saves the ball from going out of bounds and passes to Michael] Here we go. Three! [Shoots and misses] Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!
Forget it! Forget it!
That's what she said.
Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.
Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
Pamela Beesly Halpert--
[to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
And I want kids.  And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
We're going to ...
[mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.
That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--
Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
Dwight?
I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?
Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.
Give me the bottle!!
Whatta we got?
Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin' for lunch?
Wow!  Who opened the morgue for this thing?  I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in.  [to Jim] There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it.  Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!  [sees Sadiq (IT guy)] Oh, come on! That guy?  He is a good guy, not a terrorist.  Karaoke, I love it!  I am a karaoke fiend.  I call dibs. I got next, I got next up.  Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok?  Where's that wine?
Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?  Where are you off to?
[looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
Hey Pack-man.
Mm-hmm.
You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that.
Have a seat.
Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
Dwight?
You're not going to.  You know where you're going?
Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
No? No! Jim! Come on!
I know, I know.
Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...[walks away back to his office]
Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
[on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Mmm!
If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
Oh ok. For how long?
Ok.
Da  na na na na.
It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
Here we go. [organizing his costumes] And that. [to waitress] Hey. How you doing?
Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?
We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?
Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.
Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
I don't know, it's just...
Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
I'm just walking around.
Was it the cleavage?
[walking around and greeting people] How are you? Good morning. Good morning.
It, you know what, it really is.
Really?
Okay. [leaves to get laptop]
I know.
OK, it stopped.
Woah, wow, who told you that?
Lay them on me. What?
We need to sell her an elevator pass.
Do I have any messages?
They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
No, they can't.
That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting.
You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon!  Come on! Come on.
And a woman-
[talking head] This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be awesome. I've decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
Come on, Ryan...
Ugh!
Oh God-
I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
[video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
I think it has a... Yeah, it has a deck. They call it a porch, but it has a deck.
I'm right.
[Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
David told me on the phone. David told me.
That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?
Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style.
I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
Uh, I don't need one.
Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin' off to?
Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
And I offer same day, free delivery.
Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
[angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.
Istn't it?  Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic.  So you're from Des Moines?
Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.
What? Problem solved.
Yeah.
[shouting] Louder!
Uh-huh. [comes out of office] Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. [shakes Charles' hand] At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. [leads round of applause] Here he is.
[laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him.
[follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...
So how do you search?
[accent] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.
Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
Say hi to the kids.
Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam's chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don't have copiers. They don't even- [struggles to get up from Pam's chair] Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?
Cool, cool. Box it up.
[on the phone] Okay, that quantity of cotton fiber will cost you... my screen disappeared. I know. I will click on the bottom and... Yes. I'm getting one of those little hourglass things. Used to have a price chart on the wall, now it's a little hourglass thing with an arrow next to it. Now it's just an hourglass thing. Uh-huh, yeah, well, or I can call you back. Okay.
How do you know?
Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.
[disappointed] Okay... [Jim is confused]
Alright.
No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. [Stanley laughs]
Sucks to be you.
Good. Yep.
Oh, God, I hope it's urine.
Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
This is perfect.
It worked.
She strong?
No, no. I know you didn't intend to, but I just I got the idea and I, uh, I just don't it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something. You know? And then prey on their emotions.
And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.
[to cashier at coffee shop] Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette [cut to a blonde woman in a skirt]. Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. [woman walks right by and doesn't respond]
Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he's doing now. He's a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the... [laughs] He doesn't even get to play in the game, I mean.
No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
What are your symptoms?
Okay, yes, sure, I will do that...
They were so happy down there.
Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
You're 58 years old?
Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
[while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?
Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
Awesome blossom.
Hi. [Michael sees Toby] No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?
[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.
Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
Very good.
Well, it's mostly made up. So...
I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
Who is he?
You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.
Thank you.
Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake.  But you can't just go right to the selling, you need 'small talk.'  What topics can you use for small talk?
Let's just push on, shall we?
Is it Stanley?
Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.
Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
[sigh]
That you are afraid.
You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
Okay. I'll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.
[imitating E.T.] Why?
No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
I don't.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub.
That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
All right, we need something for Kevin.
Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
I was never given a name. [hangs up, he and Dwight sigh in relief]
Dwight...
It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott.
I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
God. She left this here?
Uh, what the hell is happening?
She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
Oh, thanks. [Michael and Andy do a fist bump and explosion.]
Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.
I'm pretty sure we said slap.
Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.
Good news.
So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?
You knew about this all along, didn't you?
Alright. Movin' on.
No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
Okay.
Yes!  We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
BlackBerry.  Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit?  You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.  [drops BlackBerry on desk]  Excuse me while I type on my Banana.  I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.  [thinks] Apple. [nods]
There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?
How about some Splenda?
[after some encouragement] OK.
I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don't... You don't call retarded people 'retards'.  It's bad taste.  You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.
Oh, your face!  Oh!
I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.
I need somebody to pick a card. [Dwight raises hand] One of the new people, please? Tony? [Tony walks away]
MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word.
Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
Espresso?
Mmm. [Donna giggles]
Yeesh...
Why do I have to explain everything?
Well that is... because... I am a genius.
[sighs] Oh, my God.
People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
[points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it.
Five years old?
Just-in case. What's your last name?
[knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah?
I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
This office is cursed.  [sighs]  And we need to do something about it.
[as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um...
[to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal.
Yeah, baby, here we go!
[trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.
Wow. [walks over to the plant] What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
Oh thank God.
[Something flies by Michael] Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-
Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!
No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.
Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
Hey.
What?
It's fun to stay at the -'
Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I---
Yeh.
I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play.
It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
No, you are remembering it wrong.
I have listened to that song so many times and I still don't know what OPP stands for. Other people's... Something. I... [shakes head]
Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.
When we were going out?
Let's do that.
Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
Yes.
God, Dwight!
I'm just a bee, Dwight, ok, just a bee, just buzzin'.
It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.
So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like...
You're just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?
Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so...
Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
Grab you here.
Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
Okay.
Million dollars!
Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, 'Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it.' And 'Border-line harassment when you call me at home.' But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.
Good to see you.
The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
Uhh, I don't know.
I did.
What?
Kevin.
Well, that's really not the way I roll, because sometimes I'm in the zone, and sometimes I'm in the zoning out.
Alright, in my defense...
[reluctantly exits elevator]
[seeing bird] Oh, God!
Dwight! Jesus!
Haha, we struck the mother load!
Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.
Thank you.
I'm not worried.
What?
Meeting confirmed.  Would you like your confirmation number?  Please grab a pen, because I will only be repeating this once.
Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.
Oh, cr..., oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?
That's a drive!
OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
Really?
I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
Oh, thank you my dear.
David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? [writes 'Koi pond' on the list] Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
Uh...
We're watching it.
OK.
If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]
All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.
OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth]
That's not a joke.
No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said...
That is true.
A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]
Good.
Ok, ok, ok.
Pam... PAAAM!?
[sobbing] I'm sorry I called you faggie.  You're not faggie.  You're a a good guy.
Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.
Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, 'Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.'
You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
How did you get in your wheelchair?
I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
[standing outside hotel room... whispering] Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?
Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
I don't believe you.
Get lost.
Well, he's just mean.
I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly's Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]
Um, not personally, no.
[entering break room, to Maurie] You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
There's no downsizing.
One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.
Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
Thank you.
I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...
Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy.
That's my car.
There's no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell 'em that?
Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? [Angela raises her hand] Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... [Stanley is laughing] Oscar, you're gay.
You having fun?
Okay, okay. What kind of car games did you play in the 'hood?
These are shaped like paper.
No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.
I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
Come on.
I would like to see those please.
Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don't leave. Don't let him.
Kevin!
And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
I know what a flounder is.
Hello.
Good to see you. [they hug] AJ.
Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see.  'Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.'
[to stewardess] Hi.
Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
Yes.
Oh, okay.  Gah.
Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
Who wants candy?
[Pam knocks on his door] Go away.
Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day.
So, any questions?
I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
Okay.
Sad. To soak up my tears.
What?
Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.
Check it again. Hit refresh.
Okay, go, go, go, go!
You've got it.
Cow surfing?
I am well, sir, how are you?
It's a fake wheel, dummy.
[to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! [imitates vacuum cleaner] I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. [humming theme music] Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.
I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
Not now, not ever.
I know, I know, no, what... something else.
That was  us, right there.
[looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?
Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?
Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.
I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
I'm pretty good on politics. 'California is bankrupt, and California, California.' [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?
Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
Yeah! Oh ho ho [laughing]
Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. [Starts to leave office] And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
No it is not.
[Jim has the ball] Jim! Jim! Right here! [runs into the elbow of the guy guarding him] Ow! God! Hold it!
You have no clue why I've asked you in here?
My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
Which is it more of?
Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
Why, is there an untapped gay market?
Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
Yes.
Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.
Oh, she's great.
Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don't know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?
Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? [Andy laughs] My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
What's happening?
Yeah.
And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.
I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
Stuff. I love stuff.
Okay.
[Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad.
No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?
Is she crazy in bed?
Um... Me no get an agenda.
You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
You know what?  I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
No, I got that.
You're kidding me. Ahh!
You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?
Sorry. Corporate policy.
Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
It could be badass.  Yeah, it will.
So what?
No, did you?
Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined.
[singing] Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I'm never coming back.
Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.
All right. Good night.
I know, I know.
So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...
Merry Christmas!
I'm awful, aren't I?
No, no.
Uh, yes you are.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office]
That is just so disgusting!
I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone?
The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.
I didn't, you know, it was... It was dark, for one thing.
[to David] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...
Yeah.
We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Oh do not raise your voice to me!
I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
You find it?
What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
Can I have a word with you, Jim?
Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
No, that wouldn't be--
Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.
[stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.  There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor [Oscar vigorously shakes his head]  What?
No, it's not. It's lower.
No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
Yes.  Gooooo-tee!
That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
Ah, so when did you set up shop?
If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
[looking up from phones in unison] Sorry...
Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
[caught by camera crew dancing to 'At the Car Wash', but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
I don't get what you mean.
Um, my CDs.
Yeah, I hear ya.   It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you're hurting...
Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.
Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?
I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
Ok, alright.
I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.
Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!
All right.
No it's not.
What would you like for Christmas little boy?
It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.
Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?
[laughs]  Ohh...Nah.
Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.
After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
All right, just say 'some toys' please.
[touching and moving each amuse-bouche] They need to be presented... royally... anyone?
[sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
You did?
Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
I have to know whether you're serious or not.
A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
David? David?
Thanks. Today helped.
We're not supposed to PDA.
Ok, new idea.  We don't report it at all.  We just punish her.
Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?
Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay.
Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I
Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.
The Electric City. Scranton!
Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
[on video] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
He's a good mechanic.
We should invite them to the Christmas party.
That would never happen.
Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
[to the camera] Can you get her? She's right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, 'Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.' Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, 'Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael.' [pretends to vomit and laughs]
okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?
Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
You were charging me?  I'm your friend.
What?
This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
Bagel bites or something.
Messages?
[walks back in, on cell phone] What? Oh my God!  [everyone starts asking questions]  There has been a murder.  There's been a murder in Savannah. [runs back to his office]
Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.
I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin's open mouth]
Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
I don't think... I love it!
No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.
Really?
Wow, I don't want to hear... you talk.  Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?  [stumbling] Oh, oh, oh.  Alright.
Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
[mumbling softly] That was a very good point.
Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here?  Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?
Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why don't you just go... away?
Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
Mm. mm. Oh well.
Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?
I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
Oh shoot.
No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.
I'm gonna back out of the deal. Nothing personal, but I feel like I have been taken advantage of here.
Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
Yeah, I know.
It's next. Just keep it. 'Look on the supply shelf.' What? What is that? All right, Ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?
You're not gonna lose them.
Now you got it.
I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.
I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]
Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
That is full of soup.
Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
And next to your kids. What?
[on microphone] What? Was I not supposed to say it? [Jim unplugs mic] What? Turn it back on.
What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
Stop it! [smacks Dwight's arm]
An intervention.  It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.
I'm writing one, yeah.
Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
What's up?
Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?
We're party girls.
You know who used to sit at that desk?
Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
Oh my God...
This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will 'do' you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
[mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I...
[on the phone] What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.
Hey. What are you doing?
Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, let's listen to that again. [plays Jan's message] 'Michael, it's Jan.  I guess I missed you'.
Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her?  As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, 'Don't worry, be happy.'
Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!
Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. [Oscar stands there stunned]
Are you making a--
This is great.
Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.
[examines items on the reception desk] Mmhmm, China. China.
All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.
I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.
Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around]
Uh huh.
Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
Whassup!
I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...
Jim?!? [dial tone] Oh my God.
Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do.
So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.
[looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on.
Keep. I will finish that later.
What is up with you two, Holly?
Oh! Well...
Give it to me Dwight.
Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
But the branch is still mine?
[reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
Really?
What?  What does that even...
Maybe I'll stay.
No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?
Okay. Thank you.
The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?
You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
[on microphone] Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
That's called card stock.  That's what you're feeling.  Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, 'Am I good enough for this job?  Do I have what it takes?'  And I think we both know the answer.  We'll find that out together.  You can keep that.
You think she'd talk to you?
Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.
Yeah.
[comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard]  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?
Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
You can call. Can you call 'em?
I bet, for you.
Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  He'll call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, he'll call.  If he doesn't, he is loco.
[meeting Ed Truck in parking lot] Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin' back.
[crawls out of the cheese cart unseen] Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin'?
Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
N-
[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
You understand? You... you get this check.
I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.
You have plans.
[frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.
Yep.
Yes!
Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
Yes.
[Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What's the matter?
Shut it...
No, I will seduce her.
Hello.
Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
Two are for souvenirs.
Monkey see, monkey do.
Because it's very scary stuff.
Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.
No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry.
Okay. [waits for call]
Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? 'Oscar. I am the Count.' Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.
No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
What are you talking about--
Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.
Yeah-es.
If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
No it's not, not like penis-wise. [as Santa] Hello little boy, what's your name?
Yup.
It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.
Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
[zipping through the hall while texting]
That's her?
No.  No it's not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people 'faggie' since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
Yeah?
[mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
I can't take it anymore.
We're not doing anything.
You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better.  My body's literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.
Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
You do?
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
Assistant to the managed him -
Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, 'I don't respect you!' Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. [as Borat] Respect is niiice. Borat. [as Rodney Dangerfield] What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!
Hey.
All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
So that's what that means.
I'll get some punch. That looks delicious. [shoves Santa hat into punch]
OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.
Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
Awesome!
I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.
Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good?
On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.
No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
I...
Nice to meet you.
I need you to do something for me.
I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
Really?
No, never heard of it.  No, a
We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
I'm not firing anyone.
Yeah?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
Hey Jim-bag.
Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.
Ehhhh....
What do I have to live for?
Okay. Sure.
Andy.
I'm not going get a brain-
Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch 'Lazy Scranton'.
Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
[in parking lot, blocking path of Stanley's car] Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. [Stanley honks horn repeatedly] Stanley, are you having an affair?
Okay. Uh...
You can do it, just say it.
[Michael storms into office] Wow.
I think it's going to be any minute now.
Hey!
Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
No, I mean this apartment building, it's fantastic.
Oh, don't start,
Yeah!
We will demonstrate on Pam.
I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, 'Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.'
Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
Sandwich platters.
Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
Sure!
You'll figure it out.
And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.
Who's got Roy? [Jim does a behind the back move around Roy for the basket]
Are we ready?
Six years and two months.
Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - [Jan leans over and kisses Michael passionately]
Ok. Yeah, what, what?
Wow.
I'm goin 'in!
I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...
Uh, nope.
God, this is gonna be fun.
[points to door] Right there.
At least.
Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
Pam!
Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
Okay! So...
Could I talk to you for a second?
I don't want her to get away.
...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
You know what?  I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
Yes.
Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
Okay.
Oh, you do?
What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. 'I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy'. Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
Helene?
I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh---  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!
I don't... remember.
[on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.
I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?
Hey, hey!
Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!
[clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--
No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
Don't run.
That's still going on?
All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes']
I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.
Can we have a moment?  [whispering] Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.
Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh?
That's nice though.
Mm, the Big Apple.
Pam, could you come get me?!
Midnight, Oscar!
Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!
Bathroom.
Oh... It's ...
No, no, no... no, no...
Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.
Did you see Oprah yesterday?
What are our plans for tonight? Umm...
Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
[clapping] Beautiful. Very good, nice.
She's nice.
That's... What do you mean, 'Michael'? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
Okay, Dwight.
Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-
Jefferson.
Yeah, me, too.
Aaaaaand, go!
He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
I actually wrote a movie.
Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]
Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?
Hello son.  If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead.  Life is a road---
All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.
This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.
Thank you! That's really nice.
Do you really wanna know?
What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes?
Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
Oh, can you imagine?
Jim.  Lots of e-mails to Amazon, lots of wasted computer space.  Alright, let's get back to work.
Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
Ah, just the stupid leads.
Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
Pizza by Alfredo.
...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.
Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
Yes, it is true.
She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.
Um, yup, wait, yes.
But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
Is this the tape of me falling?
Yes! Thank you. God. She gets it. [laughs] We just picked the best one right? Just had it.
No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!
Okay, alright.
[to camera] Could you...?
Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
What?
So, what do you do?
No... cleaning... up.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
[grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay.
How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?
Well, that is probably from the test drive.
You know what I might do, I might make this into a kids' room.
Yeah. Oh... oh!
[after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us...
A DSi?
Please.
What are you guys talking about?
Exactly that.
Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. [Creed gets in his car and drives away]
This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall]  used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.
[choking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
Oh, man. How much time do you have?
So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.
Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.
Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
[on phone] No, no, no, I'll talk to her.  I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes.  Alright, by pickle.
Come on, no, no, no.
Mmhm.
No it's not.
Alright... One more time around the block.
No, no, no, no. I don't want to chip my mug. Please get that off the floor. [sets mug on the edge of Michael's desk]
Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  [Pam sighs]  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
I could have helped.
I guess this could be the one, huh?
Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
All right.
No, no, obviously older.
I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?
Okay, I will think about it.
I bet.
What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]
Easy no.
That's not in tune. I don't know if you can...
I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
I would love that.
It's... That's...
Okay.
[runs down to parking lot, sighs]
Because you think he's black.
So check out how we live
Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.
Ah, yes. Ah. [laughs]
What...
Take it from Toby.
Get out.
What a douche bag!
Hannah?
[flashback to Phyllis' birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis' car] Happy Birthday!
I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?
Jim?
What is taking someone from behind?
Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read:
Well, okay...
Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?
[seated] Ok. Ok. How 'bout this? [rises, waves, sits back down]
Disruptive.
I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
Just let me know who the winner is.
Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I... you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done . [no one comes forward]  Very well.  Then you are all punished.
...business meeting --
Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
Pam, are you my friend?
[pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]
For instance, why don't you go to business...
We are a law firm.
Umm, hmm?
Hmm..
Oh, thank you.
You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.
Well-
Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
Yeah.
OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
Okay.
I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand]
I'm just going to put this over there.
I love you guys.  Now I'm getting her voicemail.
Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?
Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!
Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
Uh... Ten year.
Yeah?
We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.
Oh, wow.
[talking over Jan] You're glad?
The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
No.
So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
Would you stop it, please?
I didn't ask.
[shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.
Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.
[tossing pizza dough in the air]
Right.
[on sidewalk] There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! [all groan]
Well, I am starting it again!
Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
[thoughtfully] A statue.
Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like 'Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.' It's very dramatic.  Although, I can't say I was a big fan of  'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.
No, don't!
I'm between specialists right now.
Alright.
Yes, thank you.
Well, then, Gould wasn't kidding.
Yeah.  I withdrew too.
Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
Oh.
Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
Good, it's good.  Good work, everybody.
Who should it come from, then?
No. Don't like that.
Above and beyond.
I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
Hey! [walks up to Oscar and Darryl tossing basketballs, grabs Oscar's ball] Game over. [kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling]
Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. [Continues with cod German]
Yes.
Open your mouth.  Come on. Don't swallow it.
I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
That
And that Angela's a midget, and that [indicates Jim] your chin is too big.
[kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.
Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
Why don't... hey.
I got shotgun.  Damn it.
Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.
Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
Did everybody know about this but me?
No.
Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
That'a girl.
[to Maurie, the Asian intern] Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said 'The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.'
[holding a chainsaw] And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.'
David, wait.
A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
Yes.
Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment.  Like... the moon landing.  Or Vietnam.  Rolling Stones.  Greatest band ever.
That will not go over well.
