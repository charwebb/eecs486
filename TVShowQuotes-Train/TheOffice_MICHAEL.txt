I don't know about that.
Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
I've never met anyone who does that. You wash dogs? Very cool.
[on microphone] No!
[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.
Ok. See you soon.
It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.
[shouting] Louder!
All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?
Hey.
Yessh.
I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
Yeah.
Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
And she took a bite, started to choke. So what do I do? I have CPR training. Go around, start doing the Heimlich.
Good.
Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. [reveals hidden broccoli, spits it out] Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.
[Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping]
Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing]
Whassup!
Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.
Ugh, what?
Hey.
So...
Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. 'Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority.' Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
I've put having a family on hold.
Yeah.  I just sort've had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.
All right.
What am I supposed to do here?
Okay. [waits for call]
Stop.
Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
Because I wanted you to come to me and say, 'Wow, he is so great.' And I was gonna say, 'Well, it's in the genes.' And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
It's true. I did.
Yeah.
[slams palms on desk] Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
Stanley.
Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...
He's up there.'
Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?
Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
What you don't know... Well, it can hurt you, but if you don't know it won't hurt you. Then, you can just be happy for a little while at least.
You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
That's what she said. Pam?
Yes, I am, Charles.
I could manage my way around that.
Oh, man. How much time do you have?
Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...
Hi.
Jefferson.
Years!
Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not.
Yeah!
It's next. Just keep it. 'Look on the supply shelf.' What? What is that? All right, Ryan, look on the supply shelf, would you?
Maybe I'll stay.
One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
No... [they kiss again]
Stop...
Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?
[examines items on the reception desk] Mmhmm, China. China.
That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Thank you.
Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?
I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.
What's a Nazi?
All right, Andy, please.
Thank you.
You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
Well that is... because... I am a genius.
You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.
Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.
Hmm?
It's whoever, not whomever.
So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
Andy.
[slurping] Oh, wow. How long have you worked here? How many years, Creed?
Oh yeah, you'd better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.  [kissing noise, kissing noise]  I love ya Pam... okay.  [singing]  I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow I'll be back.  I'll be back.  Tomorrow.  Um... yeah.  So you know what?  Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
You are a liar.
Potential, lots of potential. yes.
[walking past bodyguards at the door] Officers. Thank you.
That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.
You... are... kidding me.
[laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
Your nose?
No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
Keep. I will finish that later.
I might.
I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
I got thirsty.
No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
[looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
No, I'm a regional manager---
Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?
No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time.
Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door]
Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office.  Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead]
Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
Right... Executive assistant.
I don't know.
I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.
She strong?
[sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey!
You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick?
Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
For what?
See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
Maybe, I don't know.
Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
Okay.
Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
Yes.
All right. What's the scoop, how far?
[Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
Okay, so killing yourself. [laughs] I was just thinking about snot.
I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?
Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?
Im not a shark.
This is you we're talking about.
Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents' divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.
Okay. Uh...
Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
Oh, queer... [realizes he is on camera] eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs]
Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey!
You know what, guys?  It's none of your concern.  It was official business, so just...
I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
[rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
Me too, me too. Is this wine?
Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.
Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let's get this started.
That's rude.
Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.
Oh, every man's dream.
I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?
Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.
Let me ask you-
Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?
Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry.
[on microphone] Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.
Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
Um...
No!
You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
[speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -
[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can't help but feel partially responsible.
We didn't break up.
No.
All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.
Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]
I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
When did this happen?
Uh...
[walks over to Kelly] Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
Arrr, dooby dooby do. 'You need to do something about your B.O.'
OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
Wallace is going to freak.
For a CD mix tape...
How long is it?
[sighs]
OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...
No, don't!
And I will be taking questions.
Friends fight. Friends fight.
[laughing] I don't know what he's doing.
It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
You know what?  This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people.  I don't care if it's pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.
I'm in. I'm in. Here we go. [Lonny gets around Michael to score and he ends up in front of Phyllis] Zone, Phyllis! We're playing zone!
[Pokes Ryan with a sex toy.] Gotcha, oh! [Phone rings.] Yes?
No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
Yeah.
Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.
Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
On. Just put it on.
The CFO? Ohh...
I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.
No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
[hands Kelly a receipt from his wallet] From the mall. That...
I had to do that.
You know what I might do, I might make this into a kids' room.
Oh, boy.
So you don't want to end our relationship?
Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
The what?
Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
No, I got that.
Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
[in video] The Dundie award for 'Longest Engagement' goes to Pam Beesley.
Okay. [passes Jim some index cards]
No.
No, no, not real bombs.
Sure.
MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
[smiles, sighs, chuckles] Okay.
What?
She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
Do you love him now?
[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?
Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot. [hurries out]
I can't go back to that.
You did uh... okay.
Ok, ok, ok.
[sitting at Jim's desk]  Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
Listen to me. I like you so much.
I could have helped.
Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK.
I didn't hear you. [laughs]
May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
Ah. Well. That's not true.
Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.
This is all we need.
No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
You didn't know it was my birthday.
Well, Roy is dead, and I ask you out.
Just amongst ourselves.
No.
Aaaaaaaa!
That's what I said. That's what she said.
It's a celebrity tournament.
No you ahh.
Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
What the hell is going on here?!
Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
[howls like a wolf] Oww whoo whoo! The Answer was on fire!
No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon!  Come on! Come on.
No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.
I'm not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with.  Just fun, healthy young woman.
As my associate.
Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.
You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? [manager looks up, angrily at Michael] Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! [Erin looks thrilled and walks up to the stage]
I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
What's the matter?
Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
[singing] Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I'm never coming back.
[quietly leaves room]
Sure.
Keep the change. Here you go buddy, happy birthday.
Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.
I don't know. Maybe.
Great marks, Phyllis. [Phyllis walks out of Michael's office smiling]
No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]
Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them.
It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
What? No, she didn't say that.
Good for him.
That's his profit.
Uh, what the hell is happening?
I know, I know.
You...
Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.
[turns to address Jim and Pam] No way.
[very excited] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.
I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.
Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
[knocks on Pam's hotel door] Hello, good morning.
No.
[also in a poor Australian accent] The Dundies!
Well, I am starting it again!
Oh, my God, Dwight.
Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
Lynn was as hot as Erin.
We're not.
I have recently taken a lover.
Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
No, I will ex-squeeze you.
Thank you. You remember Ryan [Stanley laughs deeply] And Pam is around here somewhere.
It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.
Mmm. [Donna giggles]
Aha! [crashing]
[gasps]
No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.
Let's get down to business.  Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
Toby, come on.  Let's go.
What about Oscar?
And here we have 'Mister Roger's Neighborhood.' Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.
Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
Cruise control.
Oh, okay. I'll tell you. Let's see here. Three bedroom, two bath...
Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh... I check the jewels every month. This time... You know, it's a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So... What's, um... What you eating?
Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
Morning Dwight.
He's the longest baby in this room.
Hey.
No.
He's hot, all right? What do you want me to do about it?
All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
You are also on record as saying 'wittle-ittle,' 'footy-wutties,' 'nummies,' 'jammies,' 'make boom-boom,' 'widiculous,' and 'wode iwand.'
Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
Yeah, I know when it's from, Ryan.
Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. [camera shows Devon sitting outside with West Nile]
What old days? What are you talking about?
Oh, Okay.  Okay.  Just...[Michael takes down banner, clears throat]  Well, our old friend Ryan Howard is back, and we're going to give a little presentation about the future of our company.  So please listen up. [awkward pause] All right.
Yes.
Mm hmm .
Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
Divorce. Um... Okay, 'Meredith is so old...'
Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?
Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
Ok.
You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, 'Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?' 'High-five, Donna.' 'Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?' 'Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit.'
All right.
I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?
There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.
Which one is that again?
I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?
That's my joke, damnit Dwight.
I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...
They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.
Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
Hi, Oscar its Michael.
Yes.
This is you. How much do you charge?
Yes, yes! Okay!
Alright...
-- I don't think it is.
That's my car.
I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That's the life.
Eight months?
Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
You're welcome.
I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?
And oh, Jim...
Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.
You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
I don't... okay, just listen.
You know what?  I deserve a bump.
No, you may not.
Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.
I have my passport. [pats jacket pocket]
Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?
No, no. What could possibly be wrong? Everything's great. Just keep living your lives. Everything's gonna be fine. [sighing] You are all such wonderful, innocent people.
Good.
Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.
Well, I'm writing a message.
[sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.
What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
How old are you?
Wow. High score?
Okay.
Yes!
Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
Phyllis?
Yeah?
Shut up!
We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.
I don't like that story babe.
[behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning]
I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
Mmhmm.
[angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.
I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
I didn't get any agenda.
I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so...
No, I think you're cutting in line.
[laughs] Try it on.
I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. [in British cockney accent] It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.
[clears throat] Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted.
I know, I know, I know.
Oh, big time.
Hey.
Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  [Kevin groans]
Good.
Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did.
There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]
Twenty years.
I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. [hands him a thin black folder] Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
[annoyed] How do you know this?
No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
Okay.  I promise.  [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps]
Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that?
Nope, nope, nope.
[on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
Mm hm.
Yeah, do you?
What are our plans for tonight? Umm...
I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
That is how you do it.
Oh!
I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?
It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.
You need the big guns, yes?
We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.
We're not fired?
When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
Good. Here come the sharks. [they imitate jaws theme sounds and Dwight makes shark fin on his forehead]
Oh, you know. Nohting. She's  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...
Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
Uh, huh.
No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
I know. [sighs] Okay.  Alright.  [Pam goes to punch him again] Oh-- God!
And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.
Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.
Just do it, okay?
Office romance. For example, Pam and I are dating, do we have to disclose that?
You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.
Because it's better. Because it's more special.
And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
It's for your trouble.
All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael]
Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.
Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
Okay.
After breakfast.
Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.
I don't think you froze.
Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].
Yes.
No? Um... Check your spam folder.
Pammy?
We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
Dwight...
Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
Ok.
I know, I know you're angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?
[in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.
Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo...
Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
No, of course  you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.
Irrelevant.
Wikipedia.
[Dwight knocks on door] Yeah.
Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates.
Ahem.  What's up?
Oh, my God.
No, whomever is never actually right.
Yeah, I hear ya.   It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you're hurting...
Ah, the volunteer Sheriff station.
Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read:
Blah-di-blah!
Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met.
What is it?  No, just tell me what it is.
Mmwa.  Mmwa.
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
It's Jim, Okay? Yes.
If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
Yeah.
Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
Umm, hmm?
Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
Okay, be my guest.
You guys! Yes! Yes!
The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant.
I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.
As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
[Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.
Oh, did not!
Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
[stopping Manager] DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!  Let's keep it moving!  Let's keep it moving!  Toby, everybody!
Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
Mmhmm.
Yeah.
No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
Oh my God.
You know, I don't care what he did to me.  He's mean to other people, that's what gets me.  He's just...
[Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your---
Welcome.
Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?
Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
Oh, hi.
Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys. [exclaims] Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.
What?
It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.
There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
Dwight, you ignorant slut.
I just want you know, you've been a big disappointment to me today, okay.
No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
Because I would kick his ass.
Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, 'Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.'
Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
Will they throw their hats, you think?
Really?
That's-
Hell, yeah.
Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
[clears throat] What's the difference between Meredith and Michael Jackson? Michael Jackson's surgery was unnecessary.
I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
Okay. There you go.
[singing] ...since the world was turning.
Toby, can I really tell you anything?
Wow!
Oh, the Wall.
I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, 'I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.' Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball.
Aw. Well, hang in there, okay?  You know what? You should get one of this big body pillows. That way you wouldn't miss you-know-who so much.
This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]
We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
I will try to manage my excitement!
For what?
I have two sure things, one wildcard.
You did?
Pam, please?  I have Country Crock.
No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...
Yes.
So what's going on? What I miss?
Yeh.
Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
That's insane.  We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
La la la, hello Oscar!
Thank you. All right, when we get a call I'll come back and you'll do the smile.
I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
Fine.
I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.
No! It was like four years ago!
[singsong] Just-in time.
Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
This is going on the outside.  The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner.  Do not tape those on.
What?
Hey.
OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
It'll take like two seconds.
NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.
Mmm-hmm.  Saunas.
A siesta!
Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
Dwight?
That was embarrassing.
Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?
No Gould?
Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
No.
Yes it is!
Yoko shack.
Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
No. Don't like that.
There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
[Something flies by Michael] Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-
Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.
Ok.
Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
Erin, look. [holds up parrot rum bottle]
Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don't cash that till Friday, OK?
Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
Here's a helpful suggestion for Jim.  Jim, instead of e-mailing Amazon, to try and get that CD that you didn't receive, I suggest that you go to Visa and tell them to cancel the charge.
Just sit down!
Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?
Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?
Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says 'Creed.'
Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? [Angela raises her hand] Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... [Stanley is laughing] Oscar, you're gay.
I-- mmm-- I'm good.
Yeah, that's smart.
Here we go.
Oh, yeah.
[sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...
I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
She's Pam's best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?
I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
You know who used to sit at that desk?
Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
It's okay. It's all right.
Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry.
[runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
I know where this is goin'.
Don't. Please don't say anything. [sighs] Oh, God.
Yeah, well duh.  Where ya headed?
Both sad.
Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
I... this is Creed.
Exactly!
This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.
Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he's doing now. He's a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the... [laughs] He doesn't even get to play in the game, I mean.
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car]
Take it easy.
Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
Wow.
I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
You might take something.
[walking in] What's going on?
No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where 'Dunder Mifflin' is listed right above 'Michael Scott Pap']
Oh, really? Ok.
[whistles poorly] Whoo.
I'm not a master bee.
Okay.
What does what mean?
Oh don't. That's disgusting.
Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'
I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.
I really appreciate it.
Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
Really? [Jim shakes his head no]
Thank you! That's really nice.
Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.'
I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
All right, I'll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs]
That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.
No, no. I get it, I get it, I get it. A child is born, 'Oh, oh-hum.' A beautiful sunset, 'No, I'll catch the next one.' Right? Unicorn walks into the office, 'Oh, do you have an appointment?' [laughs] Okay, look Pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you're doing wrong. You are the voice of this company, right? And when clients call and you're not smiling they can hear that in your voice. It is a real turnoff.
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
And I want Charles gone.
Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so...
Two minutes apart.
Alright.  Alright!  [tears up tickets]  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...
Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
Um.
Okay, I'm out of here, [pretends to leave] see you later guys...
[hold up barrette] Well...
Who is Dr. Perry? I...
Easy no.
That was deer!? Gross, oh!
Please.
Okay, all right.
It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...
Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
Yeah, yeah.
Nah.
Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.
Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
[As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie?
I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.
Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
Oh no?
Mmmhmmm.
Plus perks, yes.
And you think that'd be sexy?
[pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]
Let's go.
Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
No, no you're not going anywhere.  You're staying here until we figure this out.
Ok.
Oh, man! Man I tell ya. Iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches. [makes 'pop' noise with his mouth]
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
No, nothing like that at all.
I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
No, I insist. After me.
[coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils.
Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay? [playing badly] Okay... I'm hearing a little too much reverb. [feedback echoing] Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead. [playing Smoke on the Water] Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?
Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?
Frien..sss...yes, you're friends with a hobbit, and... look where you live.  I mean, you've got it all.
What do I have to live for?
No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.
I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
Music...
No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.
[coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you?
[imitating E.T.] Bummer.
You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?
Whatever.
Dwight, I asked him.
[in the limo with Dwight, Andy and Oscar] I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.
Yes.
No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
What did I say?
Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying 'He's talking about you!']
Ok, good.
Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...
[walks into Toby's office] Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?
BFD. Engaged ain't married.
Yeah, we locked him up for two years.
Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?
[deep sigh] There could be others...  I need to know.  I don't want to offend anybody else.
Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up!
You forged them! You forged the forms!
It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I don't expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people.  We have fun. [giggles] We just have fun!  Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out.
What is that?
Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all.
Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?
Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
Well, no no no no no...
So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
Bye.
Andy's afwaid?
Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?
Yes, I do!
Ye-- No.  Alright.  I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.
Well, okay.  Different management styles.
Oh thank God.
Ah, fine.
Yes. Thank you.
Did you get lucky?  Oh!  Boink!
Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking]
Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
I have to fire someone today, okay?
Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
I don't get what you mean.
Let's go mini-golfing.
Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
Let go, please. Just gimmee -
Right.
Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. [sighs]
Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]
Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.
Alright. Movin' on.
All right.
He sounded sick.
Just bragging rights.
This place is so cursed.
No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.
...awesome.
Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
Are you kidding?
Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah. [clapping and chanting] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Erin]
No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying 'Dwight did it!!'] You?
Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.
You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
Did somebody say 'baby back ribs'?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs]
She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
Tell him. Tell him that your supervisor is on the line.
Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
[in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]
OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
Yes, definitely.
Meh, exactly.  Eh.
Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth.  Why don't you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?
I haven't signed them, ok?
Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
[cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. 'Old School'.
I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, 'Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?' These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.
... What?
Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
How much? How many pounds is it?
All right, all right, I'm on a roll.
Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
That is just so disgusting!
Pam.
Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.
Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
Thank you very much.
All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between 'A' gym and 'B' gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm. [period bell rings] Should we go?
Saint Bernard.
Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
So that's the problem, is solved. What?
Would you like to help me with a special project?
Yeah, me too.
Hi.
If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]
You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
Hi, Carol. How you doing?
[to Jim] What are you doing?
I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
Don't drink all of it.  Give some to Oscar.
Okay.
Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation...
Come on, come on.
Really?
Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
Yes you are.  Oh, buckle up Jim.
Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
I'm going with Pam's group.
Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.
No, I don't.
This is bull[censored]!
You don't know what it is. [Laughs]
Yeah.
You know what.  I had a great time at prom.  And no one said 'Yes' to that either.
[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
Why?  Wha...
All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
[visibly shocked] What? Why?
No, I'm sure that's not.  Na...
[wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What's so funny?
There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.
Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!
This is a little character I like to do [places a green turban with a yellow feather on his head], it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. [puts an envelope to his head] Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. [tears open envelope and pulls out card] 'Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.'  Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.
Okay.  Hello.
Hello.  I've seen you guys around.  I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?  [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here?  I need to purchase something.
No. OK. Um, the last word is 'seagulls.'
No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
Rock it!
Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
Ok. All right.
This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!
Huh?
At least.
You are.  You are.
This is where we first kissed.
I think it has a... Yeah, it has a deck. They call it a porch, but it has a deck.
Oh, after you.
Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.
Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.
Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.
Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.
Yes!
Nice to meet you too.
Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
I have herpes.
Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
Well, he's just mean.
[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
Thanks.
Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
[grinning] Ohhh, God.
I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
Well...
Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
You can not, I have a thing tonight.
Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
And have a good elevator ride.
Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.
We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not...
[giddy] Yeah...
Alright, bye.
It's a deal.
Hello.
That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.
They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God...I better call.
Okay, okay, okay.
I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
Aw, my car.
You are doing it.
Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
Yeah?
You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.
[crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It���s every parent���s dream.
Wait.
Your stupid friend zone.
How can you give up my diary like that?
Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
So that's what that means.
[Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
Alright. Excuse me. [slides past Eric to close the door to Ryan's closet office before Eric can see Ryan in there] If you will -
People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.
No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?
Yes.
David told me on the phone. David told me.
[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
Yeah.
Stanley, we're havin a little...
Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
Hello, hello.  Hey!  Your face is almost back to normal.
Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good?
OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
[misses a half court shot] Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. [Dwight scores] Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go.
Yeah!
What?
[playing cat's cradle with Holly] Okay, am I grabbing this one?
[follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...
You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
It blows. It blows, man. Gah...
Alright, here we go.
No reason.
P-A-M. P-A
It's not very well written, but you get the gist.
Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
Um, yup, wait, yes.
Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
Okay, sounds great.
Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
Good to see you.
No, it's in like ten minutes.
Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays] Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. [music stops] And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. [clears throat] Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays]
Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.
Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
Ok.
Yep.
You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
That's not-
OK, I am really going to do this.
[nodding] So stupid!
I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
Oh, yes. [mimicking smoking] Doobie-doobie doo.
Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.
Let's do it!
Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is...
Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
Okay.
Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!
Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.
Oh, God! [chokes on food] Oh. Wow.
But I got all the foot off of it.
She will have a greekaccino.
Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?
Do you want the raise or what?
Okay shut up.
Hey there.
It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Ahh, wow. That's dangerous.
Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
I'll call you, too. [to Brenda] So. You are probably gonna get carded, so I can make you a fake ID. We have a laminating machine.
That's not a joke.
To the right?
Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.
I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn't even me. It's so not fair that they want me to resign.
No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.
That was hilarious. The foam ...
[panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?
Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I don't.  Yes, I do!  No, I don't mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this... call waiting.  [answers his phone] Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.
Ronnie was bleh.  Things were at an all time sad here.  But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town.  And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard.  Give him to me.  I want him.  I need him.
Yes. I said that yesterday.
What difference does it make whether your here?
No, no, no... no, no...
No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.
It's- that's different.
And I really really need to talk to David.
How about Thursday?
What a horrible day.
...Jim.
OK, OK.  Good.  I'll catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye. [hangs up phone]  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.
I don't know, same old stuff.  Same old.  Boss just been ridin' my ass.
I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
No... you're crazy.
Check please.
Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.
Umm... hey.  Ah, what's hanging?
Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
Okay, well, I really think that... [dial tone beeping]
I will have to answer.
Oh, that's red eye.
No! Better!
[Ten days later] Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
Just. I need your urine.
You... oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.
You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?'  Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, 'Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?'  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.'  But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  [Dwight nods]
Hey! [walks up to Oscar and Darryl tossing basketballs, grabs Oscar's ball] Game over. [kicks the ball up to the gymnasium ceiling]
...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!
No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don't dial Carol before I get drunk.
Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
I will do my job to the best of my abilities.
I was going to put that in my message, Toby. All right? So just cross it off. Cross it off, now. [Toby writes on birthday card] What are you doing? Oh come on, you're ruining it. Toby, come on.  Just, look at that. That's wrecked. Ass. Get some white out.
[muttering] Can't you?  That's so nice.
This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
What's wrong with me?
Okay, yeah.
Trick question!  Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer?
He's totally wrong, Pam. [to Justin] Hey.
Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
It's fun to stay at the -'
Come on, Andy, seriously.
Okay, yes, sure, I will do that...
Oh, OK! OK!
You are disgusting.
Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
Here's what I was thinking. The following weekend, I drive up.
Of course. You're always working hard.
Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
I mean you can tell.
That is not what Wallace told us.
I always do.
I will allow that.
Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
Fourteen years.
I color code all my info. I wrote 'gay son' in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means 'Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?' Most colors mean 'Don't say it.'
One, two, three.. [all scream]
Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
No, did you?
Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.
No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael's office] don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.
Do the boobs!
My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.
I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. [Jan sighs] ... I'm just kidding.
Oh, what's that out there?
Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.
Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
That's, whatever stupid show you want-
Alright.
Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.
Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
Are people watching?
[picks up a basketball and dribbles it away from the basket] Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip. [throws the ball behind him and misses the basket, tries and misses several more times]
[points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
[under his breath] I don't know about that.
Yeah, I'm busy right now. [hangs up]
Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
No, just bees, just bees hanging out, buzzing around.
Alright.
Thank you. [groaning ceases]
Surprise!
Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They're lithium.
The machine knows where it is going!
[sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
You're welcome.
No, you don't.
Back to the Future? [she shakes head] Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.
Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!
You would not believe what happened here.
I don't feel bad.
So which way are you leaning?
Exactly.
Yeah!
Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! [snickers] So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That's how I want every day to be.
[in line to fill up water bottle behind Kevin and Toby] Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?
I don't know about that.
Yeah, I get those every day after work.
Maybe!
Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.
Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?
Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.
I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
[quietly] No, no, no.
There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
Hey, have you seen Jim?
Exactly!
I did?
Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?
This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
So you wanna? Thanks.
Where?  I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let's go.
And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
[reading off piece of paper] Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison.  But we zoom back further---
Just making conversation.
Old fashioned meet market --
Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
Mmhmm, I'm sorry.
No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
Look...
Okay.
Alright who wants to party?
Very good [Jan nods]
In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?
Ok, you know what?  You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
You should've told me.
Oh, here we go. This... um, here's the deal.
Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
Above and beyond.
And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
Yes, I do.
That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.
Is Oscar around?
Alright... One more time around the block.
Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!
Okay.
No!! Come on, gimme something good!
Up and over.
No, no, no, no. I don't want to chip my mug. Please get that off the floor. [sets mug on the edge of Michael's desk]
I just got back from vacay. Come on. Give me a break, man. [holds up CD] Waves over Jamaica, $6.99.
Where do you wanna go?
Thanks.
Really?
Okay, who said that?
Ohhh, no.
Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
Hello son.  If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead.  Life is a road---
Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
There's gonna be a free room?
Wanna head back?
Hey!
I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi...  It's called Reginald Pooftah.
Yes.
By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?
Alright, after you.
You have big plans for tonight?
How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
I think this is going great.
Sad, something to break.
Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]
Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]
Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.
[singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back [Christian laughs]
Oh, that looks good.
Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.]
You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
And that her butt refuses to quit!
Don't drink and drive.
Thank you.
Why are you here?
Thank you.
Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?
[in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.
Oh!
In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.
And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
[sad] Ohh...
Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
I can't say.
Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us. [in a Mexican accent] Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
Because of all the good work you've done.
[while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families.
Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
Close the door.  This is your fault.
350
No it's okay, we're talking code.
Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on.
Thank you very much.
You never know about the press.
Yes.
Pam, would you smell my breath?
Awesome.
I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself.  Let's both.
Uh, yes you are.
What do we know about him? He's an accountant.
And I've dated four women in the last--
Yes you do.
Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
Yep.
No.
You're so lucky! Good one... [clapping]
Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  [Pam sighs]  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
Okay.
Good.
Those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I'm going to show them that we have nerfs of steel. [winks]
WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
[on phone] So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring.  Very good, nice doing business with you.  Thank you. [hangs up] Yes! [chuckles] Oh, yeah!  Read it and weep.  Oh!  Oh, look at that! [puts post-it on Phyllis' forehead]  Look at me, Phyllis!  Oh, what is that?  That's my sale! [humming then dancing victoriously]
I just think that HERO? It's cute, but it's... It's empty, you know? It's easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind...
Mmm-hmm.
Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
God.
Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.
Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?
Oh, okay.
[rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct?
You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, 'How could they do this to us?'
Yes they were.
[to Holly] Can't set 'em up like that.
[walks over to Erin's desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.
Who's got the hungry?
Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
No.
Best friends.
I'm braver than you?
We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it's sexy, it's sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?  The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom.  So.  [to Pam]  I've been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?  [Pam shakes head no]  So, sexy is fun...
[mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
So Phyllis is basically saying, 'Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth.' I gave Ryan an iPod.
Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
[extended Lazy Scranton video] Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash]
--that none of us can be a part of--
Charles is going to tell you.
You said butt.
Yes.
So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?
Put it down.
Place is packed.
Sorry. Corporate policy.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
I'm not going to make this call.
It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!
Really?
Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?
You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.
Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo's phone vibrates]
No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
All right, just...
it was fun. We had a good time.
Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!
[turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!
This'll be [with Dwight] the day that I died.
[next house] Hey Toby! You suck! [throwing eggs at his house]
I don't understand- [phone rings] Hold on.  Sorry. [answers]  Yes, Pam.
Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...
Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let's don't... Don't harsh my mellow, mon.
That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.
Paper money. [clears throat] Yeah. The company's doing fine.
No, that's not how I meant it.
Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
No.
What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. 'I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy'. Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
Cool!
Pam!
I'm sorry.
What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
I thought you had to pee.
[sitting on the roof of the office building] Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.
Erin, do we have the journal?
Yeesh...
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: 'May your hats fly as high as your dreams.' ... That was a pretty good line.
Well...
Yeah...
Thank you.
Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting's not over.
No, I don't!
That's ironic.
Any good headhunter knows I am available.
No.
Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave]
Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.
Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
No.
I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
Yep.
That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.
There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words.  That's her fault.
What about...
Well, that is probably from the test drive.
What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
You're kidding me. Ahh!
Would you like to dance?
Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
Send me a picture.
Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.
Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...
I have a new place.
Oh, can you imagine?
Yes, I am.  It's very sad.  Because he was my boss.
[laughs] I'll be over there.
OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.
No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]
You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!
Whoop! Okay, what?
English?
Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.
Yes it is!
I can't believe you're not going to be there.  It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man.
And.
No, no, no....
Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
Hey, I'd rather kill myself.
You're right.
Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
[yelling from Parking lot] Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!
Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.
Okay.
Hello, Dwight.
Shh shh shh shh.
Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!
Holdin' down the fort.
Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard!
Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money.
Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
Hey, you know what?  I can't do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. [flails his arms]
MACGRUBER!
Should have done this a long time ago.  Tons of personal e-mails, huge time wasters.  Uh, uh huh.  Wow, like Kevin, rating the best bars in Scranton?  Poor Richard's number seven?  Idiot.  Stupid load.  [phone rings]  Yeah.
What are you doing?
Yeah, they used to.
Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
[nervous laughter] Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?
It is.
Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder what's going on. [follows them]
Ahhhh...
Yes!
What was that, Kevin?
I know.
Hey Jo.
Nice to meet you.
How is that funny?
Okay.  It's going to be great.
[in his office playing with a Dunder Mifflin Truck when it drops and the 'head' of the Truck comes off]
First sentence is: 'I'm a proctologist'.
Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you.
All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
Toby Flenderson, come on up here.
Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.
Oh, no, my God.
Be my mo manley.
Oh! OK!
No, I'm not calling your weirdo cousin.  Twenty-seven years old, never left the beet farm.
Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend.
No, I won't even consider it.
[over phone] I love you! [laughs]
Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
This is Michael.
Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...
How are you doing?
Okay.
[sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.
Is anyone still at the church?
Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Mm! [gives Jim a high five] Yeah!
Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?
[standing with Holly next to 'Welcome to New Hampshire' sign] Oh, it's really cold here.
... with coffee but without the haunted.
And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
No. No. He's my nephew.
Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha.
[walking into Darryl's office] Darryl!
[laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
What do you need?
No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.
[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that says 'Good Morning'] Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.
We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said 'did I stutter,' and I said 'wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?' It was joking, Toby, alright?
Oh. Thank God.
Mmmhmm. Yes.
Oh really?
Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
Home owner. About to join an exclusive club, Dwight. Maybe some day these people out here will know what that feels like. Maybe not. Who knows? Not my problem. [groans]
[sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...
Tonight?
I'm not just a middle... man...
I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs]
Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right. [throws up hands] Pull it over. Here we go.
But Ed truck can't because he is---
Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.
... customer service is a Hindu person.
How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
my weekend was bad so far.
No, not at all.  Nope, come on.
So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.
You got that?
God, this is so disgusting.
I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Yes we do.
[opening a delivery envelope, takes out slice of pizza which appears to have a section off the end] Okay... don't ask me how I got it, let's just say that I have... connections. [folds it in two and takes a bite] Mmm.  Mmm.  [with a full mouth and an Italian accent] I'm the Godfather.  I'm gonna eat this whole pizza.  And then I'm gonna kill you. [digs around in envelope, pulls out the rest of the slice] [indistinct] some cheese.  You gotta fold it up.  That's the way you eat pizza.
Well then I won't get a warrantee.
Alright! Here we go!
Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
[carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst...
You have plans.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
It's complicated with Jan.  And I don't know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
You gotta crack these things open.
Yes. Homelessness. What?
That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.
Wait. What day is today?
I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
Okay, we're trapped.  Everyone for himself.
When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
I agree. He'd land on his feet.
Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
Go bag! Where's my go bag?  Where's my go bag?
Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
Ok. Thank you.
Look at that.
Oh, what are you usually?
Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.
I really thought these people were my friends. My best friend since kindergarten, Elliot, that's a friend. Best friend ever. I should call him. Wonder where he lives.
Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
Try 80.
Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps]
Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
No, no, no. That's his punishment for not being here on time. Too bad, anchor!
Oh, yeah...
All right.
Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
I, uh, hmm.
Rock n' roll!
[phone rings, hits speaker button]
Alright!
Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
Oscar, homosexual accountant.
Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right!
OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
[to Dwight] I vouched for you.
All right.
You're welcome.
Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
Who?
Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
[standing in a line saying goodbye to the kids going to Mexico] Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We're proud of you. [starts to walk down through the line and into the bus] Bye. Okay.
No, I did not.
Hi.
Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
Oh really.
OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!
Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
I don't know, I don't know about that.
I think we could. [Donna giggles]
AM or PM?
New York.  Wanna go?
Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
Hey!  Why don't you just sit down, please?
What the hell is that?
Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You.
I'm goin 'in!
You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do.
...uh, no.
Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.
Dwight...
I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, 'Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?'
Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.
I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.
Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
The Electric City. Scranton!
I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?
Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
These are shaped like paper.
Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.
Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.
You want more?
We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!
Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.
Yup.
Oh, look at that. [pushing bike]  Smooth roll.
Please?
Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees]
Phyllis?
Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.
Uhhh... nothing.
Thank you. Sharing...
Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri.
Yeah?
Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
No. Actually the trip sucked.
Hey, Julie! You having fun? [Julie leaves]
It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.
You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
[quietly shuts the door] Go.
They're good, huh?
Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?
Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
It's not my decision.  It's mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer--  [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] -- tility.
Okay, well... all settled, then.
No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
Okay.
Here, let me...
No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
Okay, Ready?
You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright.
No. God. You go talk to him.
Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]
But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
That's what you're going to do, Luke!
My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
Ohhh, great.  Well, now I'm in a terrible mood.  Let's do your performance review-
It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
[into mini recorder] The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...
[shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.
No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.
All right, get out. Get out.
I love you guys.  Now I'm getting her voicemail.
It did not.
Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend! [sings] Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
[grabs different remote from the table] Well I will turn up the volume.
Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate...
Keep simulating.
I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
What do you want me to do Jim?
Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn't much of a fight, actually.
For Kelly, that seems a bit much.
Okay, okay. What kind of car games did you play in the 'hood?
OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's]
You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I'm okay. No, I'm not.
Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
Ow! God!
[singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
Yes I do.
Cause he slept in the car a couple times.
Now you got it.
I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
Second bedroom for the ladies. I mean, the extra ladies who aren't in my bed, or for friends or family, whoever wants to pop on by to casa de Scott. And right in here... What, what's in here? Uh-oh, bedroom number three. What are we gonna do in there? Limitless possibilities.
Yes.
Well, it's, it's-
Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!  No deal.  Not with Michael Scarn, FBI.  Michael Scarn doesn't make deals.  Michael Scarn shoots and then asks questions later. [blows on his fake gun]
I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.
Hey, hey...
We're going to ...
Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. 'You can't be on the team', 'You can't move on to second grade'. Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.
They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
I'm not sick! I'm burned!
No, that's not it.
Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
Good. All right. [everyone leaves]
I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor. We need to find out what is blocking you. And that way, we'll be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored. May he rest in peace.
[on phone] It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. [hangs up phone, blows train whistle] I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called 'Curves.' I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!
Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.
Yep.
Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It's not like gay... shame festival.
Yeah?
Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.
Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?
Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?
It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.  [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser]
Shhh...
Regional manager.
Can we have a moment?  [whispering] Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
No.
When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls].  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that
[on microphone] That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.
Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.
You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch.
Did you get the yams?
Right there. The coach!
So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
Oh, good. My hooker's here. [laughs] Hi.
Uh, I don't know what you mean.
Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!
Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.
[clearing throat noise] Idiot. Dwight's an idiot! Did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it?
Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
I thought that you were engaged?
Should've had hindsight.
Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?
Oh.
There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
There you go.
Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
Hey let me escort you to your desk.
Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! [on phone] This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! [hangs up] Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
Oh, god, Darryl!
Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international.  The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...
Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
So maybe. See ya.
You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
Yes.
Yeah.
Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.
Ok. [tries to kiss Jan's hand] Ok, why don't we just step into my office?  We're gonna go in here.
Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
Yeah.
No, it's not.
Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. [Starts to leave office] And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.
It is your problem.  That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.
[thoughtfully] A statue.
We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
Uh oh.
[as Homer] D'oh!
So much for sex without consequences.
I'm not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college.  Okay, all right.
[puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]
Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about?
[to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
Good luck.
Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch]
No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
Yep, all right.
Heh, okay, weirdo.
Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.
[hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.
...for Phone. What?
[in nerdy voice] Con-- you look like a nerd.
Anybody else?  Who else has an idea?
You? You haven't made a sale.
Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him.
[yelling] All right, everybody in the conference room!  I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW!
For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
Wouldn't that be fun?
I know...
I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. [takes off sweater to reveal tuxedo] I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
I don't need to tell you that.
Entourage!
No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
[sighs] Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what... Why do you care?
Uh huh.
Pam, could you come get me?!
Thank you.
And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
Expectations....
That's my corner.
Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.
I can't.
Really? What did they say? 'For a good time, call Michael Scott'?
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.
Well I believe in love at first sight.
I don't like that at all.
I... uh, well, I don't know.
[sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?
Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.
Right.
Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
Really?
To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. [moving on] Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
It's not amazing... at all.  It's sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.
Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
You're just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?
Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
That's true.
Love you, as a friend.
Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.
Stand clear.
You never said anything.
It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
Come on. Okay, um... [draws a circle around 'Don't' with a line through it] That's as clear as I can make it.
It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
[getting off his stomach] Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. [picking up a portable tape player] Let's try this. Put these on. [DeAngelo puts the headphones in] I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- [DeAngelo winces] That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, [gives him a card] and make it sound perfect.
[trying to stuff balloons below the seats] This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.
Our biggest worry.
I know, somebody will. And we'll wait.
Did you?
Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.
No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.
Just know that if I could have fired you, I would have.
James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue]
Who else?
Because it's very scary stuff.
It's up to you to change his mind.
Yes.
Against who?
You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!
M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
Good morning, Pam.
Don't wanna forget that.
Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.
I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
Right here.
[nods uncomfortably] That--
There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one: You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play.
My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]
[from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is...
So we're good?
[honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied!
The two levels being, uh, 'Welcome to Scranton'...
Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
I have to buy another place.
[camera pans over, Michael is sitting in a chair] Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
Hey, that's good.
Oh! What's our receptionists name?
Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
[Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down]
Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!
Yes, yes.
Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake.  But you can't just go right to the selling, you need 'small talk.'  What topics can you use for small talk?
The Electric City. Scranton.
This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--
It is always a treat when
Mm-hmm.
[Angela enters Michael's office] Ah.
That is the way Southern people talk.
Cooper's.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
That's good.
[whispers] Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave]
You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.
What was that?
No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!
Hello.
[in his car with Erin driving to lunch] Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
Yeah... ugh. She's... [gets up and leaves] you don't deserve her. Alright.
Ready to do this?
It's surprise Meredith. One, two...
I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
On your left!
Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...
Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
Which is it more of?
I would love a place where we could meet older
Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. [Erin tosses open scissors across Jim and Pam]
Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.
I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.
Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.  I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.  But now, no.  I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did.  I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, 'Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends.  Go get yourself a monkey kidney.'
If you lay a finger...
[Outside of the restaurant, obviously sad] So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
Jim, Jim....
No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people's lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.
Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.
[mumbling softly] That was a very good point.
Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]
So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?
Let's hear it.
Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
That's what she sai [clears throat]  Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
[points at woman] What does that look like to you?
How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.
Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!
[to Pam's mom] Hey.  Hi.  Do you--would you have a snack in your purse?  You're a mom.  I just figured you might have--
Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
It's too late.
Huh. Well, maybe those will help. [puts bag of walnuts on his desk]
That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--
Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?
Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can't pay for your college.  But you don't have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. [students perk up] Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.
Oh, hey guys.
I tried, I tried.  I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail.  I feel like I'm dying inside.  I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II.  She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.  I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.
People are always coming to me. 'Michael, I have a secret.  Your the only one I trust.' No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend.  This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.
All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?
Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. [DeAngelo laughs]
[going up escalator in the hotel] This is nice.  This is nice.  Move in here.  Very sweet... ah.
...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
... Oh, God is that today?
Good work. [clapping]
Okay, well, we'll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office]
In my condo complex.
Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?
Stanley, gotta play hurt.
I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
Oh really? Was anyone killed?
Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...
Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.
In the dump.
Yeah.
Ok.
Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
Just let me know who the winner is.
[motioning to pad of paper with hangman game, spelling out  'S_an_ey is chea_in_ _n _eri] That and that are the same letter.
Ohh, god.
You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
I made it sterile.
Do I have a nickname on the court, um? Well, The Answer would be nice, but it's taken. So, uh, probably The Question. The Answer dishes to The Question. The Question back to The Answer. Answer over to The Question. The Answer, whew, [makes shooting motion] three points. The Question, whew, whew, [makes shooting motion] six points. Nothing but net. Question, who's the best player in the league? Answer, The Question. Or the Drunkmeister.
No, nothing happened.  I-I swear, nothing happened.  What, I'm, totally being serious.  A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. [laughs] No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all.  It's off limits.  Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.  It was great.  I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.  So.
PSST! PSST!
Manuel who?
But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
It's just a really important day for me.
Pam, really, they're back?
Six years and two months.
[Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan's attention] Pick up.
You bet your fat ass we are.
Who's Michael?  I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.
No. I don't want to do any of that.
It is.  I'm good.
Is that all you have to say to me?
Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
Yes, so, no thank you.
You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
Now that's going on?
Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!
Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
Umm, nacho chips.
Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
No. Not me, him.
The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...
No, we have to cancel the party.
Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! [Pam grabs the microphone from him] Oh, here we go.
I've written all of it... in my head.
About dressing your best today?
Just give it!
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
Hey Dwight.
Pam.
Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
He wears glasses. Did you know that?
I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
He is an organ donor.
A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!
Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt]  Okay, sorry, let's, who else?  Oscar.
Find a key.
What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
Ok, it's done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now it's done.
The man has a point.
My whole life, I have known two things: I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.
That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.
Business is like a jungle.  And I... am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  [smiling] Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head.  We don't have the technology.
...Absolutely not.
My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you. [clears throat] [shouting]
And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
No-- We don't have--
That's not a baby.
Yeah.  I withdrew too.
Well, it's mostly made up. So...
Well, why don't-
[mug falls off Michel's desk and smashes on the floor] God... damn it, Dwight! That's great.
Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?
See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
So check out how we live
Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
Guys, guys!
No, this is romantic.
Uh... it was like eight years ago?
Cancel. We're canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food]
Movie Monday!  The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
We're doing this because of you.  So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.  [to Ryan] Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
I'm pretty good on politics. 'California is bankrupt, and California, California.' [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?
That's, that's a pirate movie. [Jim stares at Michael] That's annoyed. Well, he doesn't do very well under pressure.
Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
Oh, no, no. No. Don't-
Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
Got it.
Because you think he's black.
Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
Here's the door. Here's the door.
Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
Yes?
Yes, I...
No. She's an alternate.
I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone]
Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
Any emails today?
What's a bad idea?
All right. This is gonna be good.
It's a surprise.
Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!
Oh. You were forbidden.
Type O-Ocean Spray.
See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.
Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]
At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Really? [cheers, applause] Thank you. All right.
[sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.
Phyllis, can you do this?
I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
That's what makes him classy.
Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
Pam, come on. 'I like your food.' Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
Erin, what about my keyboard? [Erin hits a button on an electronic keyboard, playing a beat] Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
Wow!
Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.
Ouchy.
It's ok, they're with me.
It is.
PB and J, my mom's recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis]
[entering on a Segway Scooter] I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
What is that? A squid's eye or...
You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
Here we go.
I do. Both of them.
What?!
So it's not a free fall?
You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
...business meeting --
Here, shake. No!
Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -
Okay.
I will open the door.
Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  [whispers to Jim]  What's this about?
What?
Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, [Michael is seen whispering to Jim, then Pam] that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.
Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?
An age or month?
I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?
I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.
Hello! How are you? I'm, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we're going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what's the vibe? What's the vibe of this place?
Pam, stand up.
OK, here are your character cards.  Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.  Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.  Everything else is up to your imagination.  So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
Eat it!
You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...
Kay.
Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
The 'Spicy Curry' award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go.
OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...
Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines 'wedding' as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride 'Mawige...
That's, yep a little flimsy. Umm... OK... Ahh... Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.
Well...
Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
Yes?
Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
You don't. No, no.
I don't...
Yeah.
You're 54 years old.
What are... That's insane.
Okay, fine.  Hurry back.
I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
No problem. [doesn't turn off speakerphone]
Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
Pam, you're trustworthy-
[nods and shakes hands with David Wallace] Hey, David?
What do you mean by 'these people'?
Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
That is not big picture.
It's better than I imagined it!
Hey, girls. What's happening? Startinng to blend? Well, before long, you guys keep hanging out, you guys you are gonna share the same menstrual cycle.
... I asked for trick candles.
Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem?
So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?
Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Here's the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.
Do some... do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
They call it Scranton.
May God guide you in your quest.
Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
Last gift. Kevin.
Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.
Yes.
That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this.
Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
Goin'. Ok.  Where we goin'?  Doesn't matter.  Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.
You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
Alright, everybody here?  Yes.
I'm scared, too.
You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
You leaked it?
That's funny.
Okay, I believe you, I believe you.
Roy.
Doubt it. [disconnects call]
You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
Uh, he's a small client. They don't really buy much.
Ok, feel better.
Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...
Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
I think you're over-thinking it.
Oh God, Rabies?
Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...
You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
Come on. A little bit.
Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
Guh-od.
No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?
A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.
No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke.
You know what?  I would love a slice of real New York style pizza.
Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?
It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
I didn't ask.
Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.
I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]
No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.
Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!
Uh, I have a pajama party.  At the Playboy Mansion.  With the bunnies.
All right.
Good, cut?
Okay, uh, well, one is taken.
Alright.
Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
Come in!
Tube City, you owe me one.
Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.
I have some, uh, experience.  I, um, once had to testify in a traffic accident case.
I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
Why on earth would we give you a raise?
Well...
Sure you don't want to come?
Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
Never, ever, ever give up.
Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.
I'm not...
No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-
NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked.  Thank you.
Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.
Oh, well.
Sorry about that.  What'd I miss?
No. No. That's not how it works.
Um, my CDs.
Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.
Oh, you move on.
Oh my God.
Good work.
I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar]
I'm not going to give it to you.
Oh really?
You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you.
THAT'S MY CAR.
Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! [dressed as Santa]
All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
He is in an all-out sprint.
Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.
Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
Ah.  All right.  I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.  But you know what's invaluable is intuition.  You know what that is?  That is the ability to know when something is about to happen.  Does anybody out there have intuition?  Know what's gonna happen next?  Nobody?  Okay, you're going to make me say it.  All right, I am so proud of all of you.  Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?
Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said...
Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Thanks.
[speaking with a different voice] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably 'freedom.' At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.
Don't patronize me, Pam.
Why privately?
And do your worst.
Oh, great.
Are we gonna do it?
Wonder what I would've been back home?
It...
Any messages for 308? All right.
Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
Don't... I...
You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.
Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.'
Thanks, Kevin. Um... [Kevin walks away, revealing Jan's pregnant belly]
OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.
Mmhmm.
Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]
It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.
What?
Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.
See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!
[Dwight looks confused to the camera] Were they in the missionary position? [Holly laughs]
It was a good idea, though.
You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
Hold down the fort, I have to do something. [walks up to microphone] Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
Hello.
Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, 'Man, I wish I got that.' I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.
Yeah... I could.
No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
Sorry Phyllis.
Oh my God.
I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.
OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Oh, does he?
Like, with who?
That... exists?
No, no, no, no. No, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, here's the deal. Um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.
Okay.
All right, all right...
Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
Bye.
No.  You have to just push it out!
Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah.
No. No! Are you sure?
Oh, wow.
Well, just shhhh... just just...
No, this is my quest.
We already have that. So...
Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.
Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.
We start on a single blank sheet of paper.
Don't...
Really? We're good?
I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there's prizes?
Ryan is causing some problems.  And you were always good at handling him.  What should I do to control him?
Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here.
No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.
No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
What?
Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!
My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.
I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
In business school, Kevin. Business school.
Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.
Shut it...
I did.
IHop.
So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
We tell them the plan, right?
And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.
Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?
Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
Most do in the magazines.
Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!
No, it's not. It's lower, so...
I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael's behavior]
So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
I am.
Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.
Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear 'Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la.' No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]
And then another--
Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.
I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts.
Yeah.  In all climates.  It's going to be worldwide.  And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That's where you come in.
Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.
Andy, what's the problem?
Excellent! Way to go! Nice! [Michael and granddaughter Prince exchange high fives]
Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
[Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.
No, today at work.
Do you remember Ed Truck?
Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision.
All right, don't break any lands-speed records getting back, okay, Stanley?
Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
[on cell phone] NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... [hangs up phone, sighs] This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. [Karen raises her hand] Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
[quietly] No.
Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.
Crisis Management Squad.
I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.
What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?' Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
Your dentist's name is Crentist.
Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
Um, I...
Nope.
Thank you.
[singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
Mmhmm, okay.
You bet.
Well, I think I can get through the door.
No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.
Not much, what's up with you?
[sighs] Could I?
Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
Okay. Pam, pros.
Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
Yes.
Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.
Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: 'Hey um, you're poor.' 'Well hey, you're mama's dead.' That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.
[sweaty and chugging water from a bottle] It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. [Music starts playing in the background] Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go.
Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.' This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
Every morning.
We're all gonna have a good time tonight!
Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out.
Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.
I came here hoping to meet somebody.  You know, as you do at weddings.  End up going to sleep by the vending machine.  It was loud, but it was warm.
Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.
Oh, come on.
Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.
Yeah.
Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
It's right here on the desk, yeah.
Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
[choked up] Yeah, okay. [pauses, then takes a deep breath] Well this is gonna hurt like a mother[bleep].
Who is he?
Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
I would love that.
Sure you don't want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem.
Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
[Strains, grunts] What?
I don't know, it's just...
[Michael finally breaks] Take it back.
Yes, you did.
Hey Martin, how's it going?
Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.
Have a good night.
Stop it! Stop it!
[at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David!
Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?
Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.
Yeah. Do you have any ice?
That was awesome. Thank you.
50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
Um, how many people are you interviewing?
Pam?
When you know, you just know.
And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
I don't understand why you're so upset.
I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
Just make that copy okay?
I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay. [walking into office] Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!
Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver's seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you're dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman's clothes.
Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
In front of me.
Well, yeah, I mean, what is...
Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. [turns around, takes bandanna off] So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?
Dar de dar.
Hello hello!
You suck!
Never.  About what?  A little-- what are you talking--
Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
In-grown hair.
[on airplane] Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
Let me get your stroller.
Okay, how do you feel?
Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
He's already paying for himself.
You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.
I saw you program it in.
Not. I said, not that.
I have done things like um, 'Beers in Heaven.'
Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
I don't need your permission.
Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much? [everyone starts laughing] Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.
It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
Devon, wait, please.
Yeah-es.
You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
Okay. You've just lost my business.
And Ryan.
You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie]
Jerk.
I'm not gonna be okay.
Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.
[on microphone] I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up.
Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
All right...
Morning, honey-pile.
Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. [Kevin sits on his lap. It's a struggle] Oh my God.
Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
Okay.
What's up-dog?
You all right Ryan?
Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
[points to door] Right there.
I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a 'Where's Waldo.' [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]
Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?
[the limo driver raises the divider window] Who's playing with the button?
His name was Devon.
Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to...
It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
Anything?
But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.
Why... why are you making this so hard?
Any questions?
[covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it's done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did?
Got it right here. [pulls out Karnak turban]
No. I cannot promise you that.
If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
I need clean urine for the lady.
Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
Well, we are running a business, so.
Who's the boy toy?
[entering kitchen area] Oh, that smells good.
No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...
Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy...
Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! [runs out of conference room.] Come on everybody! [all quickly follow]
[mocking voice] Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair.
Hawkman.
Great, the magic of the gift basket.
No.
Same sort of stuff in here.
So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre. [mispronounced 'sob-ray']  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.  Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses.
[on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
No, this is geological.
Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.
Okay. Am I shiny?
Smiles.
Really?
Why? I'm not your father. [Erin looks sad] All right.
Yes, good luck with that.
You know what this is like?  I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
Hey gang. Where you been?
Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?
Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest.  It's all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And I'm treating Ryan the same way.
Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid.  Where am I gonna go?
No, it will not be. I am on top of it.
Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
[Stanley straining and breathing heavily] Oh, wow, that is adorable!
Okay. Well. Live strong.
Oh.
It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.
Yeah, he is that good-looking.
What for?
Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
[seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  That'd be fun.  Friday?
[on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there?
What's that, pipsqueak?
[points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it.
Nope. Nope. Not yet.
Good morning.
Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.
No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.
All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God.  Okay, Toby?
Ok, I have an announcement.
Uh, yes, I am.
See ya.
Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.
Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
My lord my liege.
[still watching video of Ryan] Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.
Well, then he's not a senator.
Of course, I did. I always... Yes, I do.
Oh!
[shying away] Look, [sighs] It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.
I don't.
Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.
You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
[frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
I thought it might make me feel better.
Beauty. Thank you sir!
One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
Okay, well---
I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
Twice. ... Right?
Ho-oh!
[whisper] Hey... guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
I'll get some punch. That looks delicious. [shoves Santa hat into punch]
I am the guy who roused that crowd.
Come... Come on!
Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot! [Lots of yelling and flailing of arms by Michael and Dwight]
Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?
We can do this.
Okay.  Where is my translator?
You have no idea how high I can fly.
It was insensitive and I am sorry.
She can't talk to us that way.
Uh, well I'm afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.
[on phonne] I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not... [Ryan is dancing feverishly and falls over] Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.
No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard.
[turns around to see the woman from his description] Ugh.
Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.
We did?
And laughter... also.
I'm good, I'm good.
Thank you!  Wish me luck!
My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
Get up here, Dwight.
She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.
Yes!  Yeah!
[the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!
OK...
Why do I have to explain everything?
How do you know that?  What is it, then?
No, you get outta here.
[singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again]
I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back.
Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?  Like I begged you to?  Pam would have understood.  Heck, Pam would have done it.
Look at that.  Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
It's... it's one of those two. [points at both]
How did you get in your wheelchair?
...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.
Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
I'm Michael. We dated for a while.
Burger with cheese!
What?  Part of your duties are to what?
You're kidding.
No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]
Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.
No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
Oh, okay.
We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
Pam?
Let's go in here.
So, how you been?
I'm right here.
Erin?
Yes
I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.
She's-- okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in.  It-- it--
Must be hackers.
I'm trying!
Blowing up balloons I thought.
Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
Okay...  Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
Thank you to our hosts.
Yeah.
Big...
Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up]
Yeah?
You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.
I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. 'M' your name is Mark.
Here's the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That's what happened to O.J.
Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
Here we go. This is gonna be good.
I'm going to give Erin $15.
Its not just a van.
Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.
You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.
There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
These are our demands.
Did you see Holly's butt?
That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?
Nailed it.  Nailed it!  Come here.
Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?
Two ladies at once. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Okay, you heard something. Um, yeah, it's a booze cruise, but it... There's more to the story than that. It...
Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
Do you want to hear a lie?
Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.
Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
Yes.
Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide.
I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture]
Wow.  Thank you.
[sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding.
Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket]
Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this.
[low] No, damn it!
I don't.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub.
No, no, no, no.  We don't do that.  We don't do that.
You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well.  We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?
Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
That's what I've heard.
Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?
Why not?
Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real.
[laughing] Come on.
Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
No, no, no, no, no.
Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
You are welcome.
Okay.
How about this weekend?
Want some pie?
All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.
We have fun.
- follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. [Toby's chair spins around to reveal Dwight filling in for Toby]
An intervention.  It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.
Maybe they are shrinking.
Wait a second.  You're not into her?  Are you kidding me?
That's good.
No.
Hey, Oscar!  Come on, let's go!
The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
Do you want an M&M?
Just get in the car.
I'll stay off the grid.
Ok.
Okay Meredith, let's give it a shot.
[Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
Babe alert! [to the redhead]  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
I would love that.
So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog...
Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. [All groaning]
Hello?  Christian?
I  love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.
I heard a-
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
No, you don't even know what stupid is.  It's about to get all stupid up in here.
That is true.
And, um, one down.  Next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression'.  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression.
...and you just walk negatively.
I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...
All right.
[leaving his office with his rum] Night everyone.  Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.
That's from Superman?
Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.
It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
Oy vey... schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.]
Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
Yeah.
Okay.
Walking in the door...
Yes it is.
That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
Flash cards.
We are so rich.
You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Let's go!
Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---
Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
Hello.
[talking over Jan] Think I did a good job? Great. I feel good. I'm gonna give myself a pat on the back.
Kevin?
OH GOD!
Oh my God!
[laughing] Yes, you did.
Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I
Oh, do we? Do 'We?' Is that what 'we' want? Why don't 'we' take a vote on it?
I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?
It's okay.
Try 'Control P'.
I'm pretty much devastated.
This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.  [walking away]  Who else? [pointing] Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.
Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.
Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Yes, it is.
Boom! Boom!
Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about.
No, we can't.
Yeah, I've been sayin that.
That's a really pretty song.
Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.
Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] 'You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!'
Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...
What are you wearing?
What?
Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.
Yes. Actually, I have. I have been on a hunting trip. I shot a deer in the leg. I had to... I had to hit him, I had to hit him with a shovel for about an hour, so he... That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask?
I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.
What do you like Pam?
Jimbo, let's do this thang.
Dwight.
We have nowhere else Jan. This...
Watch out, Pam. You're next!
I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
AIDS.
Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.
The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.
I'll be six.
What do I do?
They are correct, sir.
Hey, you know what?  Coincidence - I am going to go for a little stroll myself.  Are you psyched about the summer?
You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
500
Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
Really?
O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?
He's in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
[knock on door] Yeah.
It's like a mock execution.
Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.
Thank God.
We like Cugino's
Really? [everybody signifies their agreement, and Kelly gives Michael a piece of cake]  Oh, thanks.
So... high five me. We're back. To a happy... [grabs Holly's hand] look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
I didn't do that. I... Maybe he called me.
And we have sex on it.
Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
At a gas station?
Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray.
That's what she said.
Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
What?
Forget that.
I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
Give him a guarantee.
I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe.
[approaches Dwight's desk] You'll never guess what I know.
I don't know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.
Give me the phone.
Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?
Well, then I will get a warrantee.
Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
With tolerance.
Agreed?
OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
My plan-- a man-- panama.
[phone rings] Yeah?
[pointing to group of young adults laughing] Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.
That's what she said!
Yeah, I'm betting one more.
Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.
You did?
I have...
Hi. [Michael sees Toby] No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.
No, I will seduce her.
Oh, Carol. Hello, how are you?
This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
Do your worst. [they shake hands]
[fumbles] Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
I went through Holly's things.
Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!
Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
Really?
Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
But you said you liked it.  You've always admired it.
Yes.
Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.
No, Dwight!  Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me.  You're gonna sit in the back left  where I don't have to see your ugly moongob.
It was a lot of snap decisions.
No. Oh, all right.
Yeah.
Hello.
Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs]
Uh, duh.
Why?
Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
Okay. Alright.
Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.
Okay get off, get off! [pushes Kevin off] Oh! Oh, God!
Good morning.
Let's go.
You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
Mmhm.
No, you know what we're gonna do?  We're gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.
What about a raise based on merit?
Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me. But don't tell anybody that I have anything to do with it because if they ask me, I will say that you are crazy.
Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
Right there. Ah.
Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
No.
No, okay... I've had enough of you.
Is that good?
Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?
[reluctantly exits elevator]
I got shotgun.  Damn it.
Shotgun!
Damnit, Phyllis!  I'm sorry.  [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.
Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.
Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
I love it.
Who's got Roy? [Jim does a behind the back move around Roy for the basket]
Where?
No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.
What the hell was that?
I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit.  I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go.  Feeling good.  Listen to some tunes.  Should've peed before I left.
[laughs] What?
Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
Andy, what time's the show?
Okay.
Okay.  Alright, I'll do it.  Yeah.  Lets do it.  Lets do this thing.  Yeah.  What do I?
OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
That's insane!
Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.
Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
What does that mean?
I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.
Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time... Yes.
Dwight, please, please.
He looks worse.
You want me to be happy?
[looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby]  Okay, not yet, not yet.  I'm going to go wash my eyes.
Sucks to be you.
Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
Dwight, just...
[to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I'll leave right away.
Yes, I don't...
No.
What?
Excellent.
When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so...
Not so much.
What
You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.
[smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think I'm going to be sick...
I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.
Yeah that sounds good.
Can I just stay here and never go back?
[groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
But, you will not tell anyone.
[turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
[accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection.  We still don't know who the murderer is.  [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can't do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?
[accidentally into his microphone] We're going bankrupt, you think? [angry jeering from the crowd] They are really angry.
Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?
Nothing.
Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles]
[touching and moving each amuse-bouche] They need to be presented... royally... anyone?
Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly.
Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car]
No, this is a power suit.
Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
No.
Ummm-hmmm...
My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would....fall down. But then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He...stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don't want that to happen to you guys. I'm not gonna let it happen.
No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.
Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come.  What's wrong with Dwight?
Hey, Merry Christmas.
Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!
That's my wife you're talking about, man.
That is not the way I heard it.
Come on out!
Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.
[wearing Ryan's glasses] I'm Facebook.
Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.
How do I not make any more of it?
Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
I grab this [grabs a chain saw], and I turn it on and I say, 'Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre.'
I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. [Stanley enters the room] Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
That is a good point.
Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]
Dwight! Jesus!
I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. [singing] Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.
I will go first.  When I discovered
[from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.
Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.
I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?
[on phone] Yes.
[enters, looks to Gabe] If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.
Alright.
You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
No kidding.
[fake coughing] Narc!
What, are you talking about me and Holly?
Hey, sport.
Yes.
I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. 'Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself.'  That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me.
Thought so too.
I can't tell you.
OK, yeah.
Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
Good night.
[on speakerphone] David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound...  The air-conditioning leaking or something?
Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
[crashes into Jim and Pam's parked car] Oh, my god!
Excellent.
I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it.
[to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around]
Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
Okay, we're done! That's it.
I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me. [Pam stares and nods]  Don't avoid this.  I know you're dying to say it, so just say it.
Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know?  It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok.  Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
Yep. [drives off]
Two fifteenths.
Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
Yeah, Drew.
Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
Mmhm.
That's what she said.
Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don't know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?
I'm right in your crack!
Ye-ohh.  Ye-no.
Alright. Bye.
Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it! [giggles]
No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
On a Friday? [Dwight nods]
Very perfect. [girl walks away, Michael laughs] Oh my [notices Dwight making out with Tall Girl #1] This needs to be shared. [takes a picture with his camera phone] [Cut to the office - All Office co-workers cell phones go off. They notice the picture Michael has sent and all groan]
Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
No, I am, it's all about the personality, Jim.
Thank you.
Thanks. [to Andy] Andy?
Carroll, how are you?
I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
What?
Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
No, they can't.
You guys gotta be kidding.
Yes.
Are you kidding?
I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away]
Are you going to kill me?
David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
MONEY!
How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in 'Raw,' and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in 'Daddy Daycare.' both great movies, but, still.
Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs]
No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.
[scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home?
You're breaking up.
I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
See that factory?
Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit -
When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone.
Ah. [bows] Your eminence.
Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
I'm not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And...
Yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on Pam.
Oooo. Catcher or in field?
Hey hey.
Erin... what are you doing?
Okay. I appreciate the feedback.
Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
... [whispers] It's a million-dollar sale.
Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
Alright.
After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level: Midnight.
Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
Strawberries?
Who?
Aw, come on Dwight.
No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
[exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I'll talk to her.
Let's do it!  Drop that sucker.
Come here please.
Nope, no. Guests only.
Ah.
This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
[seeing bird] Oh, God!
Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
Look at all them out there, my little worker bees buzzing away.
There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.
Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. [in Oscar's ear] Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on.
Oh.
And I'm very angry, and I want...
I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
Yes.  'Which can contribute to heart disease.'  Heart disease kills more people that balers.
Check it again. Hit refresh.
We will?  I can't.  I don't have an idea in my head.
Ahh.
What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
I have my per diem. [holds up money] I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater.
No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
Ok.
To Can-A-da.
It's complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.
Oh, shiii...
Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
Yes?
You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
Okay.  From the top.  Ready?  Three-
[sings] ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
I know, just sayin'.
Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
Really?
[zipping through the hall while texting]
No, what happened with Donna?
All right. Good night.
Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
We make a poster that says 'Happy Opposite Day!' and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...
Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
[collecting pebbles off the street into a jar] Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? [old man voice] Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And I'll tell you what. [shakes jar of pebbles] You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.
Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
This is Tito.
Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
Look-
Don't let us down.
I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
What about the rest of you? [complete silence]
Okay, the opposite of that?
It is. Ok.
Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.
Just don't say no.
Hmm.
[hugs Toby, who smiles big] You're a good, good guy.
You know what Erin you do have to.
Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
On whom's authority?
So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
Yes.
Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.
On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.
No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
Yes.
That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
What?
It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
Slept like a baby.
Okay, give it to me. You don't know what you're doing. All right. [Michael starts digging]
[still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.
By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'
Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.
Hey.
[on microphone] What? Was I not supposed to say it? [Jim unplugs mic] What? Turn it back on.
You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
Yeah, you took it too slow.
Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb
[whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
[annoyed] All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.
Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.
Good to see you.  Where's your saxaphone?
Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
People say I am the best boss. They go, 'God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious.' 'And you get the best out of us.' [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.
Next-ish.
Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.
I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.  [Michael hugs Kelly, his head in her chest] Mmmmmm.
[looks at Oscar who is using his phone, grabs it] Well, well, well.  What is this contraption, I do declare?
They sound great.
Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn't even about what Ryan thinks. It's about you. It's about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it.
The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.'
They sent a limo.
[counting cash] Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... [moves money after seeing workmen walk by] ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.
Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
Dwight!
No... way.
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.
Ok, alright.
But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'
[clears throat] Hey, what's up?
They call it Scranton!
I don't know.
[imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio!  ...Chris Tucker.
We have a monthly staff meeting
Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right]
Hey, hey, hey.
A check for the kids, and for the team.
Oh.
I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
No.  There's a lot I haven't done.
[standing outside hotel room... whispering] Do you want to get some breakfast or something?
Oh, hey what is this?
That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
Oh God. Get a room Santas!
Well, I... it could be either of us.
Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
With that I can buy... half the menu.
Yes, thank you for seeing that.
[video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.
Mmm...
Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
[after some encouragement] OK.
Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.
But it's cool, and it's-
You be cool.
Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested. [pounds the elevator button] Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?
Yes, it's mine.
Hmm...
Pointless.
Hello.
...you just gots to get your freak on.
Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.
You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
I know.  I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me.  You've been my most trusted ally.
Kind of, yeah. Over the shirt, my elbow, but...
Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.
How's the party coming along?
What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.
You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
I also stole something off of her computer. A document called 'Dear Michael.'
Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
Mmm, I'm telling you the best cure in the world is comfort food.  You know how they say 'stuff a cold'?  Well I don't care you've got, the flu, Lyme disease, emphysema, you eat an entire dark meat chicken, you can walk on the moon.
Yeah, I know.
Rolando, [clears throat] I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.
[giddy, whispering] Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?
Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
[getting his spirit back] Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
See ya, drive safely.
But I'm the Godfather.
And now, the chains.
Come on, everybody.
I think I do.
Newspapers for sale!
[starts to cry] Can we have another? I think I blinked.
[walking in] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]
Just do it, okay?
I think better to be a happy idiot then a, um... Then someone who knows the truth.
Pam?
I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
[throwing away food from the fridge] Not today, Kevin.  Cannot be around carbs today.  You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs?
Hey!  Hunter!  Wha's up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
Okay, Tuesday. Whenever. You'd better try it on, make sure it fits.
What?
Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
[looking up from phones in unison] Sorry...
Now you ruined it. [gets up and leaves]
Bye now.
Alright, so, teams forming.
Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business.
Hi Dwight.
Never get's any of my jokes.
Hello, how are you?
Follow me, come here.  Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?
Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.
Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!
Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...[walks away back to his office]
I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh.
Nope.
Woah, wow, who told you that?
You're actually talking a lot.
Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
We're so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her]
Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things.
That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.
He's going to absolutely freak.
Pam, are you my friend?
I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
What's this?
[mouths 'Wow' to the camera]
Yeah, Have a seat.
[at same time as Pam] 4-9-1-7-4-5-1
And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
Not classy at all.
Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles]
Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
Kahlua Sombrero, please.
OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
You look great too.
OK.
is a guy that...
Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Woooah! Wow!
Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
Karen Filip... [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.
Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.
No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
Hey.
Oh God!
[at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. [holding puppy] Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? [licks his nose] I'm being serious. Seriously.
Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
Well...
You embarrassed us.
What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...
I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!
Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
It would look good, on my mantle.
How often can you actually donate blood?
Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
If everybody... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...'
Hello hello. Top of the morning to you!  Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! [Grabs and pours Kevin-esque scoop of M&Ms into his coat pocket] Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.
Right.
So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
March 17th.
What... can I do, for you?
Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, 'Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.' Makes you feel good.
Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
All right. Jack Nicholson for birdie.
I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
Let me ask you something.
I don't know if I can do that.  I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
Shut up, Dwight.
No, I gotta go. Text me later.
Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.
Oh, I guess that job that I got you is working out for you well, then.
Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
All right.
Does your stupid husband have it?
More than a friend, a co-worker.
Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That I'm a robot? [robot voice]  I will destroy everything in my path-
Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
[makes grunt in attempt to stop Dwight. Dwight hangs up]
Okay.
Well, you said I looked thin, so what does... Does that mean I'm like thin weird or thin handsome or... [laughing]
I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?
This is great.
They're in a whorehouse.
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?
Okay.
This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character 'Mikanos', is just a little added flava. 'Mikanos' is loosely based on another character I do, 'Spiros', who is more about the ladies.
Toward the sun.
...Danny Glover. [Jim raises hand] Yeah.
I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
No, don't worry, the chain is off.
You can toss them.
That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?
Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?
Really?
Okay. Fine. No more PDA.
I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...
Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?
I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
[returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.
Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
No, it... Yes, okay, right. [erases don't] All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. [writes 'Don't'  in front of symbol]
And he's a proctologist. [to teacher] What?
Ok, let's take 15, again.
Yes.
Just trying to be your friend.
Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I---
[in warehouse] Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
What?
No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.
I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.'
We're totally alone.
Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
I know.
Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment.  Like... the moon landing.  Or Vietnam.  Rolling Stones.  Greatest band ever.
We are a law firm.
Hey
Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!
I. Understand. Nothing.
I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
[interrupting] Okay okay okay.
How can you do that to me?
Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
AH! Guh-oood.
Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.
I can't, I can't...
No, it's Michael Scott.
Well I think we're past that now.
And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of 'Serenity by Jan' What do you think about that?
Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss. [Dwight closes door, takes off glasses, kneels in front of Michael's desk]  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?
I love him.
Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
I can't wait to be a father.  I'm going to smother that baby.
Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
Just say you wanna get back together.
That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam.  It's about attitude.
Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
Hey.
Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
I could have paid for the pizza.
[on video] ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...
Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn't go in there.  I'm pretty busy, I should just...
We have a history...
I know.
Really sad.
Nowhere.
I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]
Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
The office.
I'm sorry. [doorbell rings] What now?
I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...
No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
You know what?  I should.
Aww, really?
I love that. I love that face.
Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.
As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.
I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
Hey, Jan. How you doing?
The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
We're not hiring, Jim.
Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
Let go, let go of me!
This way to the party bus. Good.
Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? [writes 'Koi pond' on the list] Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
Top 80 percent!
Am I too short?
[entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.
I think maybe Hank should be here.
Bagel bites or something.
Well that goes without saying.
No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. [Dwight leaves] Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.
I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
I'm asking Pam to do it, please.
OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.
Look, we want you back.
[to Kelly] I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here.
Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
That waitress was the one.
You were lying.
There's a guy, there's a guy.
Alright, have fun.
Brain food. Thank you very much.
[to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one. [quietly to Jim] I didn't really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious. [picks up amuse-bouche tray]
Okay.  What?  Um...
Wow.
Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?
No.
Okay, I have more of them.
Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
I'm not firing anyone.
Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
Hey, mon!
[clears throat] Hey, there!  Michael Scott, regional manager, Dunder Mifflin.
[through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.
I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it's go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
Uh, what flavor?
[sighs] Oh, my God.
Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!
Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That's not how business works, okay? [sighs] Okay.
[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?
I do, yeah. Big plans.
Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.
I'm not gonna answer it
So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.
Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
Hello.
Pretty good.
Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them.
Da  na na na na.
You have no clue why I've asked you in here?
Yep.
[outside opening Gabe's cable hookup box] Okay... Alright.
That's good. Pleasure to meet you.
That's... they always give an ultimatum.
Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?
If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.
Be respectful, Dwight.
Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Alright.
Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um... she demoted me.
Ach! Wuh---
Let's go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
Yes.
Forget the question...
[accent] Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
I drove.
We're going to have a baby.
It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  [sees man in a turban outside] Oh my God. Ohhh. [dials phone number] Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.  Oh, we have a serious problem here. [goes out onto office floor] Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights.  Pretend you're not here.
Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Dwight, you're handsome.  You're a very handsome man, get in the car.
Earlier today.
Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.
I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in]
Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?
Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let's just do what you were going to do.
I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
Well...
What?
I can, and I have.
They're men, Dwight.
Here we go. Everybody on.
Yep.
No.
Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken]
Jackson Five.
Who else? Who else? Ryan?
Ok.
[doing impression] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.
About what?
Mmhm!
I don't either.
All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
Hey, what's up.
So you think you know a lot about business?
Gay.
Oh god.
Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?
I am going to run three possible date ideas by you and I want you to tell me which one gets your blood percolating.
Yeah, so there you go.
[after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?
Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.
No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.
I, I need something to wipe my hand.
Not just because he said it?
Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
Well, it's, like, well, it's, you know, when refine it, refine a character down to its essence,  that's...
Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. [Creed gets in his car and drives away]
Oh my God! What if I did?
[after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us...
Happy.
Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.
You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job!  Rapport!
I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic. [Stanley stands to leave] See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.
Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
So we should get the check?
All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
[to the camera] This had better be terrible.
Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.
It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...
I cannot wait to contact your clients.
Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
[slightly drunk] What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I gonna stay up all day.  Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO!  And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.
I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power.
I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone]
That was a really good choice.
When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet.
Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
Okay.
I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]
That's right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.
Why don't... hey.
I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?
Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
yeah!
It's drying, it's drying...
Well, can't Alan protect you?
[heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
I...
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
It is the 'Whitest Sneakers' award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?
This is the party.
O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
...you were at the dentist?
I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren't enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--
Let's go!
That marriage would be a sham.
[chuckles, sighs]
I own a Chrysler.
It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.
Okay.
Good, we're all here, we can get started.
Who's gonna start. How about Phyllis? You kick us off and then we'll move around. Go ahead.
Oooooh, my life!
So it's a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  It's not anything you would have ever done.
Plenty of space in the parking lot.
I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
No. No. No.
We will demonstrate on Pam.
Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?
Pow pow pow... [hands making gunshot impression, sporadic clapping]
You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.
Moon each other.
Okay. Wait, what?
You are being too modest.
Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!
Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
Mm, that sounds great, actually.
Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?
That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
Liar!
Nah, I'm okay.
This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
I don't understand.
[embracing Oscar]You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  [awkwardly kissing Oscar]  I did it.  See.  I'm still here.  We're all still here. [everyone claps]
Okay.
Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
Well it can wait. It can wait.
I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
Could I stick it with a pin?
Crystal.
No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don't have a lot of time.  I'll get the pizza!
It's from 'Sob-ray', our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me. [Erin tosses Michael open scissors, Pam is appalled]
I want to make fun of you right now.
It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.
That is crooked on that side.
So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]
The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she's not our customer anymore.
Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm.
Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley's monitor now] Let's give this a shot.
Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model.  I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.  There's face models, hand models, body models [Jim raises hand] - yes.
So, any questions?
It is a tough one.
And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
What the hell are you reading to them?
Next person on the...
Thanks. Today helped.
I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]
It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
Thanks Dwight.
Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured...
I would love that.
You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
Here ya go. [throws laundry]
Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.
I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.
There you go.
[grunts]
You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now.
Yes you can.
May I enter the room?
The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider.
Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.
Spite her - ok [laughter]
Packer. Pac-man.
Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
Car starting. [makes car sounds]  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael's face, none on the neck]
No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
I actually wrote a movie.
We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?
So no?
Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.
Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.
Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael's office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.
Yes.
Wow.  Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.
Roy said the first one didn't count.
Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!
I bet, for you.
I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
I bet.
What? What?
You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.
Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.
Um, no, no. Come on. No. Don't comfort... don't comfort her, that's not... She doesn't need comforting. We're just joking around. I think she's... No that's very unprofessional. I think she's being very unprofessional over there.
[holds out arms to Pam]
What's the um, saying, 'once their laughing they're... that's... Once they're laughing that's 50 percent of them being horizontal. So, not that I'm just... Not that that's my... that's what I'm trying to do, but I think it helps kind of melts the ice. Breaks the ice, melts... Breaks the ice and melts them. Melts their hearts.
Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
You know what? I don't think it's in...
Not it's not, there's some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out.
So, let us consider this matter ended.
Okay.
...make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don't know. It is a defective ax, my friend.
Oh.
Hilarious. Hey.
Yeah.
Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That's... You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?
You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
I do.
Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are... [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
Okay.
I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.
I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. [puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt] Berp.
Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
They could be shrinking.
Watch this. Darryl, watch this.
No. I'm not going to...
Those glasses are super dark.
I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
Yeah, I hate that.
Pippity poppity.
To tell you or not.  And I'm glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
Uh...
Ok.
It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
I will grab you here anyway. [laughs]
Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
[sighs, walks back into office]
Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.
Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
I already have wine.
And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.
[whispers] Ask him his name.
I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
Oh!  Eww... apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
Shut up Oscar.  Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please?  What is so wrong about me?  I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual.  Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.
Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
[on karaoke microphone] Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
Kevin!
[overdramatically] Acting!
Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
Yeah. But one would be good.
All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.
Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
[shakes head] Can't stop.
And a woman-
Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die.  You knew that.
So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
Jim, we're getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin! [turning up volume]
Okay, I will think about it.
No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
[pulls Toby's pants down] Beow!
Well, no.
Oh, no, that's a male model.
These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.
I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?
Okay, okay.  Who could do music?
Let's see...
That's okay.
Hmm.
I know what a flounder is.
Well... That's my watch.
I think so.
And they are having problems, so sh...
Good to see you.
He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.
Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
Get the hell out of here, idiot.
Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
Oh, there we go.
Where the hell is that?
Come on.
That's it?
Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.
All right.
Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence]
Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.
I know.
Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge]
Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
I sorta like the old way.
Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
What?
Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.
Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision.
Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. [Meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup]
Yes.
[Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!
Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
Pam?
Yeah? Who did you have?
No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.
So my looks have nothing to do with it?
Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.
Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth]
I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.
Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  [holds up painting]  And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.
I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
Kill me... right now.
You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
Yes.
[over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.  Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?
Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
So...
And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.
I have an idea.  Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
All right.
I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. [rings doorbell] He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? [loud drumming as door opens] Hey. Hi, sorry.
Okay.
Here we go.
With us?
I just... it's terrifying.
Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.
You guys ever protect the president?
Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.
Good in bed.
What was that?
Come on in. Good to see you.
Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales.
Don't sl-', ok, that's blank [Dwight picks up note] Don't, just put it-
So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.
Well, don't let it happen again.
Been thinking about you.
Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...
Whoa, 'scuse me!  Oh!
Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.
[imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
Oh ho ho! What?
Really loud.
[as Elvis] You're welcome, baby.
Can I kiss you?
The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.
Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!
... and... we had sex, too.
[sighs] Feels good.
That is not current.
Who is D. Abramson?
All right.
Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun. [gasps]  That's why I always start with a gun, because you can't top it, you just can't.
[clears throat] Stop it.
It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.
Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
I... That was just...
What?
Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
Yes.  Gooooo-tee!
Pam.
What're you wearing?
Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. 'Schindler's List' parody. ... That's not appropriate, no.
To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping...
All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well.
Okay.  Okay, here's the straight... dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.
Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.
Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.
Nope, that's Tuesday.
Yes?
Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
Weird...
Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
Yes.
Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'...
Only one that I was kind of worried about.
No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--
Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or...
Drinks are on me!
Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
Boom! Boom!
If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!
I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.
Heed. Heed.
Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
Head table, where I belong.
No, no, that doesn't make any sense.
No, Really?
Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?
Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
No.
This smells of fraud to me. This whole thing just kind of stinks.
I think you are wrong.
You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
[standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!
All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
Really?
I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun
Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah? [writes Huge Gut] Meredith?
I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy.  Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing.  I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. [cheering]
Excellent!  Good job.
Who is it? Who's the birthday?
Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.
Stop talking.
Get out of here.
All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh]
Hey, hey how is Alan?  Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!
No, I will.
I think he is.
Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.
I know.
What?
Stanley. [off camera]
Ah, great. No further questions.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.
Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
Just do your best! I have faith in you.
All right.
Later guys. [leaves the office]
It's a fish.
No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.
Yes.  I have bags under my eyes, and I can't go to New York like this!  What do I do?  What do I do?
Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower.
Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.
Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
Kevin, stay.
Okay, I don't have time for this. I need to get on stage and you are breaking my concentration. [imitating Native chant] Me Chief Michael Scott. Here to trade...
[off camera] You just press the button.
[others  start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm... whoa.
[laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
Don't shave my lips.
No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face]
Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
Can I have a word with you, Jim?
[grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay.
Yes I am.
Oh...
She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
[mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I...
Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?
Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
No, no, I don't, but---
Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.
No... God.
But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
Why?
Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.
You excited? About the new company?
Dwight, you've hit a new low here.
Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
[Toby knocks on door] Yeah?
I'm going in for a procedure today.
Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
[sighs] Let's call him and get the website.
[under his breath] Um... kay. Uh, alright.
All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent.
That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
That's right! That's right!
What?! That would've solved all my problems.
Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
[Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
Really?
No, they don't.  See?  [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]
Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon...
Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the 'Amazing Race.' [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?
I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.
Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?
AHHHH!
Well, we don't--
Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.
Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
We are, we are a family.
Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...
Yes.
Yes... just go--
Uh, I don't need one.
Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
So I think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be [starts to fan out the rest of his cards facing the group showing kings of hearts] a king of hearts.
Yeah.
Oh, God. [Michael clears his throat]
Yes.
Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.
Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]
Oh, thank you.
You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
What are you gonna call him?
Oh... kay.
So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this...
We ought to have this thing serviced.
It was my understanding.
There are copies in the bathroom?
Mm-hmm.
Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
Thanks.
Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!
All right.
I am.  I'm definitely going to do it.  I've already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?
Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. 'Hey, you think you can do my job better?' I don't know. 'What's your name?' Michael.
No, he's not.
Hey!
When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
We're circling it.
Ok.
Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
He sounds like a nice guy.
[on phone] Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!
Okay, field trip's over. Come on. Could we please get back to this?
It's nice to see you.
She suckered you too.
No, you shut up.  They need this game, Jim.  Let us have this stupid little game, alright? [Jim nods]
Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
[pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
Very cool.
Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.
Where were you this morning?
Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?
They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy's play, they took mine.
You are? What bar?
Doesn't matter.  Out please!
The human being man's name was Devon.
Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?
To jump start a car, first pop the hood.  Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.  Then you take these and clip them wherever.
Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so...
Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I don't think so.  Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions.  I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.
Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
We're really close.
[Ryan scores] Nice! Come here! [gives Ryan a chest bump]
Yes.
Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
[fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
Ryan?
Okay. Thanks for coming.
Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]
OK...
Hey Pam.
And we did this whole stupid party for you.
There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
Okay.
Yes, for dramatic affect.
Yeah.
Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!
Top of the Sunday morning to you.
Oh wow another living room!
Huh, okay.
All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall]  used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.
This is Scott.
Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
Grenadine.
Ok, yes. Sure.
Okay.
[talking to himself] I present the orientation video.
Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
Yes, I did.
Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
Really?  Would you do that?
No, no. No.
The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, you do?
Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it?
Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
Post-it Notes.
I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, 'I am so lame.' Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like... [imitating jackhammer] You know what I'm talking about?
I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
Fantastic!
[on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you.
Why so you can do it?
Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?
Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.
Alright.
Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
So I'm not in trouble?
Saber.
Yep, get it.
The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
Yeah, I noticed that.
Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...
Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.
Dwight, get the door.
I would do the same for you.
No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber.
Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
It's cheaper.
I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
Not now.
Mmhm.
You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these [giving Toby two middle fingers] and call me in the morning.
Was it the cleavage?
And I want kids.  And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
Oh... kay...
Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.
Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.
OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay.
Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
[laughs] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]
Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said.
How can you be sure?
Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
Carol used to drink lattes.
Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]
Morning.
I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.
We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.
Why didn't you just say that, Pam?
I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness...' Open-mindedness, is that even a word? '...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.' [Laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that.
Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
[singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
Okay.
He didn't say.
It-- yep, recently.
Helene?
Please don't do that.
No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.
No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
I am glad that today spurred social change.  That's part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed.  ...that's what she said.  Or he said.
I'll call back.
Yeah.
It's a sophisticated take.
I... Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal]
Well-
I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
Thank you. You, too. [steals a bottle of wine from the bar]
Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
That���s what she said.
[in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.
Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...
The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.
[enters] [in a gruff voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
What do you say?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?
[having walked up to the front] Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. [pulls the string to request a stop, makes a dinging sound]
Oh, wow, so quickly.
Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah!
I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.
Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
Oh, Pam with the dirty talk. [laughs]
Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
Okay.
Ahh, that's mine.
[to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?
[board of directors has started to exit] Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. [a few murmurs from the crowd of 'What answers?'] I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -
Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
Really?
You should get out of them.
Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.
That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.
Well, that is not gonna happen!
Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.
...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.
I'm not changing that, it's the best one.
Yes.
That was  us, right there.
I had um, one of those danishes.
Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
No it's not, not like penis-wise. [as Santa] Hello little boy, what's your name?
We heard what you said. You didn't cover it at all.
No.
Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.
That? In the conference room?
...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
Very valid.
Yes.
[everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright.  Let's quit while we're ahead.
Good, All right. Sounds great.
I don't understand.
Yes.
No, no. That is right now.
Forgot normal talk.
If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
Okay.
Just...
All right!  Martha Stewart!  You can be Martha Stewart's receptionist!  Very good!  I will be tea baggin' it.  Nn... no.
Why?
If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
Oh, you have your own entrance. That's nice.
Very nice.
Okay...
I have herpes.
Christ Almighty.
No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
Wow.  That just-- you've really grown.
Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.
I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.
I looked straight at the bag.
All right.
No, no, turn it around.
That's what makes it so wrong.
No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?
No.  It doesn't.  I'll find out tonight.
So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...
How can I get you to stay?
Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...
No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.
Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
Are you wearing a new perfume today?
Oh, and I'm not?  Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun?  You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you?  I'm workin' for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what we're gonna do.  I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good?
There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -
Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?
She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That's my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.
Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.
Alright!
So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
Wow, that sounds so... warm.
No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.
Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
When we were going out?
Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
Jim.  Lots of e-mails to Amazon, lots of wasted computer space.  Alright, let's get back to work.
No...
Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
[puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]
[to Jim]: Hey, you ready?
[giggles] Go go go go go go!
Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
I don't think so, no.
Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
That would be bad.
That got a big laugh.
He worked at that telemarketing place.
I don't know what the [expletive] that was.
That's nice though.
I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...
[scoofs] I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
Pamela.
Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see.  'Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.'
No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we're gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn't matter, it's an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.  [to Oscar] Adios!
Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes']
You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.
God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.
Well you tried.
I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
Lurk much?  [Erin leaves] I miss Pam.
Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
Is it a bird?
You were a Jet?
So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
I would like to see those please.
Okay, I'm calling the police.
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
God, this is gonna be fun.
Yep, never been used.
[opens present] 'In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.'
I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
I will take the fall. I did it.
Yes.
Thank you. You too.
You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
I don't talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.
You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.
I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
Ok. [Dwight howls] That's not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go. [both howl as they exit]
All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
...Stanley?
It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
[throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!
I want you to get the panty liners.
No!
So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.
Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.
I'm not kidding.
Ok.
Pizza by Alfredo.
That's it, that's it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
No, no, ridiculous.
That was helping. It was classic.
[on video] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of... [makes yuck face at Erin]
And - [Jim seals box with tape, rips covered with stickers] Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. [cell phone starts ringing from inside box]
Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
Are you kidding me?  Oh!
Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door]
I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let's go.
Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
There, there...
[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
Toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it.  It's very funny and charming and heartwarming.  And it rhymes, and if it's not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.  [laughs] No!  So, take it away, Toby!  Whoo!
My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]
Well, it says here that it's a 300ft drop.
Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on. Unless, of course, you're in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you. Good.
Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
Well-
Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop.  It.  [Dwight beings to dial] Don't.  Don't.
[doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
Alright.
Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed. [slams on breaks, camera turns, Meredith rolls off the hood]
Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.
The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
All these people are walking around and they're happy and their lives are just going along, ignorance is bliss. But if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster. [imitating monster] 'I'm gonna get you, downsizing.' No. They wouldn't... They'd freak. And I'm not going to play God. They look to me for support. And they look to me for guidance and leadership. And I think if I could lie to them and it serves them, then that's what I'm going to do.
Thought I'd catch a show.
[imitating] You ahh.
Hello. Pammy want a cracker?
Where?
I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
[returns to office] What happened?
Okay! Calm down.
Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
No.  Just ...
Don't be shy, shy boy. Don't be shy. Get up there.
That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot... [Jan glares at Michael] ...of water.
Get lost.
Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
Woo hoo! [climbs on desk, stage dives into crowd of employees]
All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.
Stay or...
Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.
Well I hope I make it.
[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
I'm sorry?
Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn't hired.
Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
[pained] Mpfh.
Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
What's the pink?
Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
That's all, you didn't mean it?
It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
God, Dwight!
Is that good?
Abso-fruit-ly.
Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael's office]
That is a great idea JB.
All right. See you around.
Hey, don't touch him, please!
Well, you kept-
Not great.
Well...
OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
What shape?
I'm... what? I didn't
What are you doing?
[walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
You and Jim are close, huh?
I like it.
[sitting on Oscar's desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...
Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  It's home, you know?  I know the challenges this county's up against.  Here's the thing about those discount suppliers.  They don't care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.
Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight.
Keep simulating.
Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
[holding up knife] What is this called again?
Anything your heart desires.
Mmm, yeah.
Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style.
Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust]  Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, 'Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work.'  What a jerk.  He's... You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.
Best day ever. Best day ever!
Isn't it?
By wanting it more. By working hard-
Jimbo.
Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.
[voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend.
Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
[crawls out of the cheese cart unseen] Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin'?
No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
Okay, well.
No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
Video games.
Yeah, you should see her naked.
Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? 'Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.
Why do you think that? You just immediately go to that, Dwight? Why are you so negative? Why...
Oh. He did? What did he say?
No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.
No, no, no.
Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn't forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man?
Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
Sorry, my meeting ran late.
I understand. We're all friends.
Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
Can't talk, saving the planet.
This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
It's... That's...
Oh yeah!
Hey, look! I'm king of the world!
Okay, put it on my card.
What's that?
Well, this is a work related matter.
[on phone, leaving a message] Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning. [hangs up] I am going to be... kind of a daddy.
[Elvis voice] Well, thank you... thank you a lot.  And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.
I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
My heart says...
Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.
Dinkin' flicka.
[on video] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?
What is a sales department? Oscar, what do you think?
Okay. Okay. 'Achey Breaky Fart.'
OK, just remember to keep breathing.
Jim, please no loopholes.
Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.
I'll see you later.
Uh, Jan, what happened?
Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
Thank you, Al Gore... for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn't do that ten years ago?
That is full of soup.
Here he is.
What are you doing?
No.
Got them on their feet.
It is not your business, Dwight.
Thanks.
Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
Just...
Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
Okay, let me try this one. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you?
Wait, wait. Check one more time.
No! God! [Jim looks at him oddly]
I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, it's good for me.  It's the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it.  I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.
Ex-husband, you have to let it go.
No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.
[imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces.
Do the monkey face.
Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...
Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
[standing for a while, sighs, turns to walk out] Oh, okay.
Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?
[music playing] It's a pretty lame party.
Dwight, can you get those please?
You talking to me?
Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight's]
Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.
Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?
Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
No, no no no... No, no.
The Electric City. Scranton!
[leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
Go.  Any questions?
Oh, great, put her through.
All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'
No.
Right.
As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.
It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
What is that smaller stripper holding?
No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
OK.
Well, they're sold out.
Dot com!
No, no, no.
Yes, Toby?
This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out?
Well.
That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.
And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.
We'll do it quickly.
I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin? [clip montage over Daryl's Dunder Mifflin jingle]
Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
[flashback to Phyllis' birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis' car] Happy Birthday!
Alright.
Dwight is my friend.
Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
Uh, hey... Creed?
I made it with my cheese pita.
Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
Mm, the Big Apple.
[comes into Jim's office using accent] Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?
Shhh... just calm down.
I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.
No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
And I nevah got caught, neither.
No!
I'm gonna back out of the deal. Nothing personal, but I feel like I have been taken advantage of here.
What?
Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.
I can't change anything. This is the way...
Yeah, [interrupting gibberish].  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.
Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?
Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
Oh.  That's nice.
Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
What does warm mean?
OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]
[leans across to Pam whispering] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
Nah, he's an ass.
[imitating E.T.] E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight]
I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
I could of-
You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
What?
About what?
No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.
People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
[as Mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?
Can I sit down for a second?
Hey. What...
Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
It was great. China.
[singing] But it just may be a lunatic... [stops singing] No.
Oh, my god!
Would she get into trouble?
I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in...
Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
Not it. I don't have eggs.
Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]
But we're bonding down there!
Dwight. [to Kelly] I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?
Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
Ryan.
Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?
Divorce. Um... OK, 'Meredith is so old...'
You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
Maybe.
You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
Oh, no, no, no.  You're good.  It was clerical.  You're good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?
Okay.  You can't smoke anywhere these days.
A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says 'Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?' This is what's at stake.
[interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
Are you still taking the antidepressants? 'Cause it was a good idea. 'Cause it'll help. It'll help, man.
[in video] He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
Oh, well, that's fine.
The gabba-gool.
No, no no no no.
Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. [walks into bedroom, Jan sleeping on bed] This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. [sighs] She probably won't be up for a few hours.
Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five. [Michael and Ryan high five] Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. [camera cuts to Pam then back to Michael] Now, who was the one before Curly?
What? Really? That stinks!
I am not budging on the hat issue.
No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.
Um...
[flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday!
So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don't care.
Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes?
Okay, no, I am not.  Dwight! [Dwight runs into Michael's office]  I want you to take Jim's chair.  No!  No!  His chair at his desk.  He gets it back on Friday.
Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
Six percent?  After all we've been through?
Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.
[flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday!
Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
Detective Wallace?
Just shut up!  I don't wanna hear anything more from you.
You're an ass. Shut it.
Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.
Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Um it is, Grotti.
300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice.
Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'
We heard it.
Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out!
No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir...
I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place. I'm gonna get married and I'm gonna have kids.
Up and over.
Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.
Could I count myself down please, Dwight. Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
I'm good.
Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.
Well, maybe I did.
Who's next?
Yeah.
Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
[stammers] Uh... Yes.
Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Can I have everyone's attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it's like to be disabled?  Oscar?
Take it back. That is absurd.
What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.
Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
We could go there, sure.
Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
Oh.
Trouble.  Okay, alright.
Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
Hey.
You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
OK, ready?
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
I... do not see you.
Come on, man!
It's a deal.
Shhh.
[Giggles.]
Yaaaaay.
And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.
Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
[clears throat and stands] Ladies and gentlemen of... the... table.  I would just like to say what a joy it is for me to be here today, but frankly, at my age, it's a joy to be anywhere [no one laughs].  I'm only forty-four, so I'm not old, and I guess that doesn't really play.  But the point is, I have a sense of humor.   And I implore you all to have a sense of humor as well.  Jan, David, my wonderful girlfriend [indicates Jan, then turns to David Wallace], my gorgeous company... Why don't we all just take a big deep breath... and just relax [breathes in deeply, no one responds].  Good.  That feels good [sits].  All right.  Everybody feel better?
We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room]
Hey.
Any of em?  So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the 'P' situation?
No, no.
Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.
Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin'.
What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
This is an inflatable sumo suit. [blows] Now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.  Well, times have changed. [blows] And it's not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.  It's about who is the best boss.  And I don't even care who wins. [blows] It's how they wrestle in a blow-up suit... [breathes in] that will tell me all I need to know [blows] or how sumo... [collapses]
No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
What're you talking about?
Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
An electric car dealership. [Oscar gets up and starts leaving]
Ahh, ooh!
Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-
Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Oh, okay.
Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
Yes, I am. Are you?
It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
[to Dwight] Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
Jim?!? [dial tone] Oh my God.
Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, sure.
[staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.
Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?
I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
No, it's not. It's lower.
Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.
I'll call him. I'll call David.
Uh...
No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
Pervert.
Milk and sugar.
It was an accident.
Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
[singing] You down with the Dundies? You're all my homies
[laughs] That is awesome.
Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
[sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.
Charley horse!
No, you may not.
Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
[sighing] Why don't you just leave? Okay?
[rises] Oh, thank you.
You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
For you, job well done.
You may be right. I may be crazy.
I'm not better than Josh.
Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
He's funnier than me.
No.  Not a giant net.
I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.
Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.
Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
[barely keeping his composure] 'Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!' [laughs]
OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
Thank you. You won't regret this, Michael.
Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?
In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.
No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.
Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. [laughs] Okay.
There he is.
Please just check.
Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
That was really fun last night.
If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?
Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.
There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad.  And that's   hard.  And it's making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.
Oh, ok. Alright.
Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan]
Yep. Yeah, she's up front.
We would have twins. [Dwight points towards the corner of his lip, indicating Michael's 'herpes']
Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.
You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.
I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.
No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
[as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, 'only the best and the brightest.'
No.
Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?
So did you hear the news?
That's her?
[to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.
Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
Sounds good. OK, alright.
Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. [Pam hugs Michael and gives him a quick peck on the cheek] Oh! Thank you.
Ummm... I don't know.
No I didn't, just please don't...
David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as.
No... cleaning... up.
What's up?
[misses a  free throw badly] I... I think you can play. Like you could when you were a kid. I think you can never give up the play. Because if people stop playing, then they stop living. It's like a shark. If a shark stops playing he stops living. And sharks are very playful creatures.
You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
Holly. Hey.
Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. 'Home Alone,' 'Risky Business.' Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
[laughing] Okay. I'm so nervous.
I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree.
I hadn't planned on including him.
Why don't you run them again?
Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.
You find it?
Mmm.
But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
What'cha talking about?  [camera pans to each face in the break room]  Okay, I know what's going on.  You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---
Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy]
Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]
Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.
No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'
Oh very funny.
I know, I know, no, what... something else.
When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.
I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
Well...
No, no, title change only.
Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. [gets jacket] I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. [pushes chair as he leaves]
No, no.  I need two men on this.  That's what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
Oh come on.
So it's not a free fall?
I know, I know.
I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
Yeah?
Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?
Dwight, Dwight!
Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
Ah. A ten inch black and white?
Temporary workspace. You can use it.
And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won.
[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
Okay.
Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
I got thirsty. How'd it go?
325, 325.
You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
What do you like best about Pam?
Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more... than just salaries.  It's about perks.  Like having sex with Jan--
Say what you said.
Nice to meet you.
I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
Boring.
[arriving at the first house] Alright let's go! [DeAngelo runs in the wrong direction] This way, this way! [Michael knocks on the door]
No, I'm team captain.
Okay.
Huh?
What is taking someone from behind?
Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.
Yup.
OK, it stopped.
I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy's arm with a black marker]
That is... who makes that?
[on the phone] Uh-huh, yes, I can do that. Absolutely! Perfect. Oh, I'm glad it timed out that way.
My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?
And 'I... love you.'
Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone!
We could do a movie... sort of thing.
Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
Find out whose car that is.  If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.
[clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--
Stan the man.
Right. What?
No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
Where did you get your outfit?
[in a singsong voice] Lets do this!
I've never framed a man before, have you?
Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
Okay. I'll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.
Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
[accent] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here's Savannah.
Good luck.
I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is?
Yes. I kind of arranged it.
Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn't.  You're not a veterinarian.  You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]
[gasps] It is?
It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
It is moving day.  I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um [Dwight puts his fingers to his head and makes a shooting noise] ssp... No, I did not kill her.  We were just at different places in our lives.  No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.  She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale.  Fresh outlook, and it's all good.
No? No! Jim! Come on!
[starts to cry] I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
Thanks. [grins]
Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
Okay.
Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
Who hasn't?  Good.  Good!  What else?
Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
Go to your room.
Leave me alone, okay?
Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -
Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
She washes dogs.
[Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
Nothing.
Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me.' A great boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.'
Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
You can.
In case... in case of what?
No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
Yes.
I'm not listening to music!
But I'm the first in the office?
Hi.
Yes
Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
I'm sorry, sorry.
You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
I'm pretty sure we said slap.
Hi. Hi. Oh... [they hug]
It could be badass.  Yeah, it will.
Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'
No, not right now.
Wow... that is insane! [laughter]
Maybe.
You're 'I need you to' is my command.
I know, it's very, very personal...
Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [Kelly slaps Michael] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Kelly thank you. [claps] She's not here, but she gets it. That's what we have been looking for. The whole time. [trying not to cry] Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know? It's like Don Rickles on acid, man. Right?
Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon.
Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, let's listen to that again. [plays Jan's message] 'Michael, it's Jan.  I guess I missed you'.
I appreciate that.
I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don't think that's too much to ask.
Yes, well, of course. Of course. [laughing]
[laughs uncontrollably]
[on the phone] Uh-huh? Yeah. Well, you know, like in a fast food restaurant, just to be nice they hire somebody who can't even find their way to work? That is Dwight.
[moves chair to Jim and Dwight's desks] Ooo, bleh bleh bleh.
I've never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.
Whatta we got?
Shut up. Shut up.
Oh God, what was that?
No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?
Oh man.  It's not a Jodie Foster afternoon without Little Man Tate, buddy.
Jim.
Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
I was going to, I wanted to.  But I had to start somewhere.
[chuckles] Okay.
The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming 'Opa!' Which means 'congratulations,' so...
Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don't have to convince me.
Yes.  Okay, let's do another one.  This is a good one.  'A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---'
What?
Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?
Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.
Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies
You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
That you are afraid.
Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report]
See you later.
I have got big balls.
[fumbling for words] Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
Ah, the old 'leave behind.' Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.
Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.
There's no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door]
Who's there?
But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
Five, four, three.  'There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldn't be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me.  They're trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day.'
OK.
Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
Da  na na na na!!
No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it.
The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead.
Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?
Eric likes Megan.
So what did I miss?
That sounds good. Thank you.
If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
Why?
Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
Hey, what about Angela?   She's hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.
Here we go. [organizing his costumes] And that. [to waitress] Hey. How you doing?
Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.
Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.
I've been putting money into CDs for years.  I bought music that I didn't even like.  No. [shakes head]
Okay. [leaves to get laptop]
God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting]
[gestures the YMCA dance] Mmm, mm mm mm. [Dwight smirks, leaves]
We are?
Guys, beef!  It's what's for dinner!  Who wants some man meat?
So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.
[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? 'Oscar. I am the Count.' Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.
I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?
Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
Wow.
Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
No, it's just us.
Mmm-hmm.
Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
So let's see what we can find out from reading. [reads] Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
Did we get any mail?
Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.
[singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter...
Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.
Oh, okay. [nods to him]
A hat.
You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
Okay.
Are you calling Karen?
All right, well, go find some.  Get outa here, please. [Dwight sighs and leaves]
Hey.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
So, when, um, can I see you again?
Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.
What is Jim telling him?  That I can't handle this job?  That 's bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.
Because he's afraid to fly.
400, 400 hey batter batter.
Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
People work faster after...
Perfect.
[walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]
I have no idea.
I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin' off to?
Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.
This is the last
Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  [in Valley Girl voice] Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious! [laughs]
How many is that?
Okay.
Keep.
Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
[talking over Jim] He's fat. The fat accountant award.
I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.
Okay.  ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
The problem is that when people hear the term 'big brother', they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It's Jan. What do I do?
You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don't leave. Don't let him.
He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
No, why? Why would I... ? You could...
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...
When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
Yeah. Oh... oh!
Where'd you eat?
I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
Oh, okay.  Gah.
Oh, you wanna go today?
Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!
Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
Oh my God.  You're not going to be able to talk back.
Dwight! Dwight!
[pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
Well...
Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh...
Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
[slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
Give it to me Dwight.
I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.
I'm hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God!
Um... Me no get an agenda.
Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
I was thinking exactly the same thing.
I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. [turns to reach for pretzel while Second Cindy turns other direction] And... my question to you [points and pulls away other waitress] is do you agree?
Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that's it. Keep it in your pants.
I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.
Y-You can-Michael.
Yeah.
Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently]
We're never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub]
You're the bait for Toby?
You ok?
Maybe that--
Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.
Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]
Now you sound like Kermit.
Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her?  As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, 'Don't worry, be happy.'
Alright, I'm gonna, uhh, get a cup of coffee.  Do you want some coffee er-
He said, we have been sold. [upset murmurs]
Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.
Just forget it.  Just the urine.
I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
How did we do it?
I will have the gabba-gool.
[knock on door] Yeah.
Um, not personally, no.
No?
Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
No problem. Worth a try.
Wow, Kevin, really? We're- [to Jan] Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here?
[points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little 'Good Will Hunting' situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.
Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
Get in the back please.
Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]
Alright.
So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
Still not seeing the problem here.
All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say 'Boo' because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!
For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  I'm going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause I've got monies to move around.
Buenos dias, Jaime.
No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?
Would you say the sale that I made earlier was huge or...
You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
Ok...
I need to know... who shot Johnson!
It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
[on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
Invite them on the tour.
No, King is higher. Then Ace. I am the Ace bee.
Okay.
Don't sell your implants please.
Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright.  It's alright. Here we go.
That's crazy.  That's crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got? [checks watch] You know what?  That's a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Who's to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, let's give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.
Ryan?
Who?
Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.
Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
I need more time.
Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
I think you're doing a great job.
Hey, can we just focus?
So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
Good-bye!
The Electric City. Scranton!
Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
[holds up a camera and DeAngelo meows] Here we go! Have Pam come down.
Yes.
How could she do this to me, Pam?
[listening to his head] What?
Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl.  I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish]
[taps on desk and starts to leave his office] Do you want this open or closed?
Yick.
Cancel it! Are you still here? [to Erin]
Check it out.
Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!
Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
[reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'
I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 2:30 to 3:15.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guy's night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.
His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off. I'm sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.
This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?
Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play.
You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
Dockworker's?
It, you know what, it really is.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
Really? Is she OK?
Yeees.
Really?
Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps]
Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
You think you would have done better without me? Really?
Oh, these... all your kids?
Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
Oh, no you di-int.
Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary]
I have a laundry machine!
Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
You know what? Get Pam.
No, it was a tough audience.
[Driving with Jan in the car] What do you want to do for dinner?
And we are going to straighten this out.
I'll just throw out some suggestions.
All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.
I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
I think it is. A guy told me about that.
No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.
Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.
Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.
Today is about family.
Pam? Pam?
[whispers] I guess not.
Hey, you.
That's good to know. [screams]
You know?
Okay, I got it.
Oh, time and resources.
I thought your name was Pudge?
Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.
When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight?
[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]
Not about taking credit.  Let's just say we all did it.
Okay. That sounds good. [puts banana in toy mouth that's in his mouth] [laughs] Yes. Actually, today's a good day to do that.
I said 'was'.
Thanks for having me.
[Darryl scores] Watch the long passes, you guys!
Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
You too?
Stop it! Stop it!
Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, 'Hey, did you get an award?' And the neighbor will say, 'No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me.' Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...
You're right, I didn't even think of him.
This place is like sexy pre-school.
No, I'm first mate. You're second mate. I'm first mate, as the captain.
Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
Yes.
No!
So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
So, the copier.
Well...
What?
It's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can...
No, I am the King bee,
He did talk about a fire in the warehouse...  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
Ok, alright, where is Dwight?
Oh, God, I hope it's urine.
Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
I know. So who's next?
Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
Whoa. What are those stains?
I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.
Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat]
I looked at the bag.
Yeah, right here. It is right there. [holds up magazine] Anybody read the news any more?
[to Isabel] Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either.  Where are you sitting?  You need a seat buddy?
Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
Happy Halloween, everyone! [notices Pam, in her cat costume] Oh... that's great!
Is Packer here?
David Wallace told me!!
Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.
Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
That's not how I taught you, right? [singing] My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out [Dwight imitating drumbeat]
She sits there all day.
My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' [they all laugh] I won't say that. I'll something like that.
No. No, no. There was wind.
I hope you're not busy doing something.
[laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?
Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
Nothing.
[gasps] I do! Hey, come on!
[stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.
He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
La telefona.
Good. Good. Good!
Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! [Luke points laser at Oscar's forehead] Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
No, they must have class.
That's still going on?
We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
No. Humans with AIDS.
God. She left this here?
You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
You use your brain too much.
[under his breath] Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now.
Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked.
Spamster!
Yeah, I rushed a few fraternities, but you know what? I don't believe in paying for friendships. So, I made a decision not to accept any offers. And fortunately none were made. Which was good, so nobody's feelings got hurt.
[as Mikanos] I like the musical 'Grease', or as we call it, 'home'.
Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
Nice to meet you.
[voiceover] I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
Play some games?
No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.
[on microphone] Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
I'm going to get it.
What?
Very nice.
Nothing.  Just hangin'.  Chillin'.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?
You kind of have.
Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
[whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking]
A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?
I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.  [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses]  Sorry!  You know what?  Let's go out!  Dunder Mifflin's treat.  Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it?  Ethical.
Yes it was.
So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
Don't talk-
Would someone just make the copy?
Oh, just went to the bathroom.
No.
That's a dog.
So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.
In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
I've really learned from the greats. The great improvisers, Drew Carey, Ryan Stiles, uh, the Brady guy not so much. He's more the signing, Wayne Brady. Um, Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. [as Robin Williams] 'That's Good morning, Vietnam!' Well, hello to you. You know it would be... God. And you know what, sometimes when I'm watching somebody like um, like Jay Leno. He'll be half way through his step [snaps his fingers] And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.' And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other... You know it's like uh, you know Leno, um and Letterman, Carson, you know. Need I say more? No.
Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.
And I offer same day, free delivery.
How?
Wow. [walks over to the plant] What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.
Yeah--
Ener-gize...
No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.
Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.
This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]
No. Do you?
No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...
[laughs at the stupidity]
Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.
Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?
Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. [throws pizza dough, hits the ceiling]
[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.
How do you make depression sexy? How do you... How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon... the conun... the conumbery
I would like your undivided attention, please.
Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
Oh that I plagiarized I think.
Get 'em there.  Get 'em there.
Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance...
$645.00
Scuse me! Scuse me!
Well, could you condense it please?
Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.
OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what...
How strange.  Because they always have yams.
It is, yes.
Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I'm not going anywhere.
No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]
Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one. [Points to Phyllis]
I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
[clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?
No, no...
Bond.
Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
Yes.
Why aren't they building it themselves?
Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let's get this movin'. [Dwight goes back to his seat, embarrassed]
You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.
How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been...  Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
Yes.
Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
That's fun.
[standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
Good, good, bro.
Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
That is a very good point, Dwight.
So that's it.
OK, I will play guy listening.
Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?
I'm glad you told me.
Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
Andy?
Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.
Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls.
Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. [Oscar stands there stunned]
OK!
['Rita Klondike 507' is written on an index card] All right, time's up!  Pencils down.  Please pass your future Mrs. Michael Scotts forward.
Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.
Okay, oh! All right.
I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'
Take it from Toby.
That's my white out. Get your own white out. Just... what's the matter with you? God. [Toby leaves] Okay, um, there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Who had a big, puttifflin. [thinking out loud] Mifflin, spifflin.
Awesome blossom.
Ohh... OK.
42897.  Ok.
I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, ' This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.' [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.
Yup.
[with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
Oh.
All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided. [elevator bell dings] Wow, that's  a fast elevator.
Let's do.
See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.
Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
[walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?
It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
Well, kids today have a very short attention span.  They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.  And today they're being distracted by the other booths.
Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I'm not gonna call Jan.  She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?
Dwight!  Stop it!  [moans]  Can you help me please, I'm being crushed.
Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?
I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.
Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.
You can't be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.
But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Hey, Justin!
Well, hobbies--
I'm sorry. [puts food in his mouth] Ugh.  Apricot.  Made of real apes.
Very nice.
Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
No.
Do that. Do it.
You're 58 years old?
I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
Hey!
There an accident? Somebody hurt?
How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger.
Thirty.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
Welcome to your future.
You mad? You mad at me?
You do?  How do you get in?
[entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?
Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually.
So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he's in love with her... [phone rings]
Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It's bland.
[shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up?  [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.
Mm. mm. Oh well.
Check it out.  Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee.
...it happens once every billion years.
To save time, Jim.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
What the hell is a terrarium?
[stands up] Anybody want any coffee or...
OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
It doesn't matter what I know.
Oh. Alright. There you go.
I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.
Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
[laughing] OK.
Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
I can just continue to run it myself.
Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
Alright.
That's possible.
He's going to swallow is tongue.
What!?
Shut up.
It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.
That's what I do, steal my trick.
I don't know.  What?
Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]
But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
Nope, can't make it.
Um, come on.
Shhh. No, you can't have it.  It's too late.
You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
Don't whine.  Get the window. [Dwight exhales]
Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
There's the x-ax...icks.
Ooh, someone's freakin'.
Good.
Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...
Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
[Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think?
Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?
[eating the watermelon] It is going to be the happiest day of my life. [Dwight gets dressed behind Michael and zips his fly]
Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---
Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.'  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
I can be very suprising.
Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
No, you wanna leave.
I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
Okay, here we go.
No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.  But I just... just want to keep it within reason.
It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?
Good work Pam.
You were charging me?  I'm your friend.
Yes, what else?
Give me the details of how that happened.
To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
I have a conflict with that.
No, no, I can do this.
Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...
[slaps him] You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It's showtime. Get out there.
No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they're really good.
Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. [applause]
You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
You know what might be kind of fun?  I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and...
Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.
Alright.
All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
It's the European cut.
I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth]
You're welcome.
Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.
No this is Holly.
Well, I'll be in my office.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. [shows off computer screen scenery] I can also make it the sky.
No, no. [blues piano playing]
Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
No, I think you're gonna stay.
Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.
I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.
Could he help us with some parking tickets?
[deeper] Da  na na na na.
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
No, no, no it's not against the rules.  She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
[Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort?   [on phone] Hey boo!
No, I don't want to wear a bra.
We're going out of business!
So? I've beaten up black belts.
All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
No.
Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
I'm going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
Jim?
Never.
As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
Well, he...
No it isn't.
[clears his throat] So who is the godfather?
Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
I like, uh...
Well, thank God you didn't steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.
So, okay.
Monkey pee all over you.
Yes, it was that. It's that one.
If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!
Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.
It was not, it sucked.
What?
This is probably the icebreaker you need.
No I'm staying.
Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?
Leave me al--
I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
[long pause] I am declining to speak first.
[exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]
Well...
Oh, place around the corner. Nice. All right. See you later.
[smiling] Uh, yeah.
The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.
...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
[from inside the restroom] Stanley?
What?
Unbelievable! Unbelievable.
Yeah, do it!
Walk with me.
I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
How do you know?
We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. [imitating Sean Connery] The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow! [camera pans down to Angela pinning Michael's pants]
Why are you helping her?  You're not even dating.'  She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...
Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot.
I guess this could be the one, huh?
T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.
Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--
Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
For me, too. You embarrassed me.
Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.]
No it's not.
Talkin' bout, uh, what?
I'm
Heres the ring.
What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.
[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like 'What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.'
I didn't say it to him. I said it about him.
Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!
Pretty disgusting.
Dwight?
[on phone] Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. [Sasha walks out] Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...
You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]
Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.
Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
Explain that.
Hey guys.
Oh, no.
You asked for a name, I gave you a name. Now you're not doing your job. Why don't you just resign?
[laughing] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.
... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].
I can do this.
Whatever you say babe.
[exhales] Perfect, well, we're settled.
Ok.
Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
Yeah.
Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
[whispering] Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
Shhhh! Keep it down.
Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? [Pam tosses a handful of Mounds bars at everyone]
It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...
Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.
No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
Yes?
When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called 'Survivorman.' And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
Woo! Yeah!
Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad.
[stares at Jim silently, then walks away]
No, no, no!
You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
Come on!
Here... Who's here?
NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed! [hands him a lead]
...And products!
Hey Jim-bag.
Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ?
I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone.
And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
Per diem.
Do a poem for Meredith's birthday or uh, limerick. Limerick. Um, [knock on  door] there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Come on in. Who had a big, smifflin.
Erin?
Dwight, what is the traffic like?
Jan called me about your little meeting!
Oh, no, no, no...
[looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
[gets up to shake David's hand] I quit.
Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.
Nice outfit.
Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
Did you? What did you love about it?
You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
We should have your contract done by Thursday.
Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
O-kay. Hello Jan.
Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-'
[laughs] Um... yes, I'll be right back!
Ok.
What?
Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?
Yes.  My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault.  [To Toby] Tell Meredith I said it another time [Toby nods].
OK. Did everybody get one of these?
Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  You're just a name and number and no one even says hello.' [to Ryan] Card!
Whatever you guys did earlier.
Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
Well no harm no foul.
I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
Oh, I'll be fine.
Alright, alright. [chanting continues]
I need to pee.
Dwight... [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight]  Give me the bottle or you're fired.
I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?
Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
Yes!  We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
You know.
Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.
Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
Think of it as part of your training.
No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
Huge?
It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.
Ryan come here!
Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.
Just something I have to do first.
When I was Ryan's age, I worked at Arby's and then I worked selling cutlery for a while. Cutlery that could decimate a penny, I kid you not. There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny. So I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn't, and will never have.
A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.  This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.  And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.  Just what the doctor ordered.
Your kidding?!
Yes.
Oh, OK.  Why didn't you call me?
What?
Hmm.
But you did still love him.
I didn't, you know, it was... It was dark, for one thing.
[laughs] Hahaha!... well...
Ah, no. Don't worry about it.
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...
Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! [gets in backseat] Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
Thank you.
I'm trying!
I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael's phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales.
No, he meant to put it right next to the hole, that's much harder to do.
Yeah
You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...
[laughs] I'll save you! I'm Superman! Scooperman!
[Toby running to get on the cruise] Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat.
Dwight, run!
Yes. God. They're awesome.
See you later!
Uh huh...
Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...
I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
Give it to me.
Hi, I am well, how are you?
A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?
We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?
[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?
My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles.
Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. [exclaiming] Oh, stretchin'. I like to stay tight. Compact. [Dwight screaming]
Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?
I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.
Oh, thanks. [Michael and Andy do a fist bump and explosion.]
Sounds like a good dentist.
What?
Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
Wow!  Who opened the morgue for this thing?  I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in.  [to Jim] There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it.  Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!  [sees Sadiq (IT guy)] Oh, come on! That guy?  He is a good guy, not a terrorist.  Karaoke, I love it!  I am a karaoke fiend.  I call dibs. I got next, I got next up.  Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok?  Where's that wine?
So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!
You're welcome. Thank you.  Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
[talking over Jan] Yes, yes, yes.
And over here..
Yeah! Toast!
OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... [Bleep] I take care of my kid!
Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find.
[Roy bumps Michael to get around him] OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul.
Clearly that's what you wanted.
There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.
You cannot say 'I was raped' and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
[cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
That'a girl.
Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
[standing way too close to Jim and Pam] Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. [Jim and Pam stop kissing]
What's wrong? Where's your costume?
Cake? Who suggested cake? [Angela points to Phyllis]
Good. The Small Business Man?
[watching her eat] What?
Yeah, yeah.
You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So...  As far as I'm concerned, [holds up WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] this says 'World's Best Dad'.
You having fun?
Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
You can't have it.
[Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.
Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.
Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
Okey doke.
Oh...
Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
Boom!  Freeze!  Michael Scoon, FBI.  You know what you did.  Boom! Boom! Boom! [shoots at Pregnant Girl and another actor]  Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you?  Didn't ya!?  Well, you didn't, because I know where ya hid the diamonds.  I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.  [another actor steps in]  Boom! Boom! Boom!
Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
Hey. You know what the best way of studying is?
Andy.
[sighs]...okay.
No, you are.
Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.
Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
Hed. Hedded
How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.
I'll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri.
Ahoy. So, how you doin'?
Um...
I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
[watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK?
Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
No, I want you to pick me up.
Ok.
What's the problem?
Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.
What?
Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
Pam.
[sighs] So how you holding up?
Do you remember what color my eyes are?
Oh! Well...
[peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care.
You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... [mimicking Gabe] 'I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!' [normal voice] Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!
Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.
Let's celebrate.
Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.
I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
They were engaged, so... [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?
Oh.
Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
What is a closer?  A closer is a sales term for someone who always gets the job done.  And that is me.  A B C, always be closing.  Glen Garry, Glen Ross.  'Hey, gimme the Glen Ross leads.'  'No way, they're just for closers.'  'Do you know who you're talking to?' 'I'm Michael Scott.'  'Really?  Well, take any lead you want.'  'No thanks, I don't need 'em.'  Because I have a client list [taps screen] right here in my computer.  [sighs] So suck on that.
Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.
Yeah?
When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
I'm a little confused.  'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy.  And then it's like all regret.  Because 'Oh, I regret that.'  But, 'Wait, I'm still gonna call you.'  But, but, 'We're just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job.'  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.
Great. Thank you.
That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.
Yeah. [singing to music] 'Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you.' Here you go.
I, uh... [to camera] I let her win.
Absolutely but not really.
So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
Tell me.
Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
No, but I'm saying hypothetically if we were dating...
Uuf, well...
They are into style.
Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
[handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.
Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
I'm staying in your--  Come on, Dwight.
That's -- thanks.
No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.
All right, next suggestion.
I am dead inside.
Yeah.
Oh, God. Oh...
All right.
Fine. I love you.
Oh, there's Gill.  Oscar's roommate.  I wonder if he knows?
I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
What is the matter with you?
Really?
No, I'm kidding.  No, you're not--you're not fired.  Yet.
Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.
It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
[pizza guy flips him off] Okay.
I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
Thank you very much.
All right, just say 'some toys' please.
Yes, I am.
Coffee Jim.
Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. [looks toward computer] It's trying to stand up... [choking up] there it goes.
300 and one penny, 300 and one penny.
You sure?
Is somebody there?
Ok, new idea.  We don't report it at all.  We just punish her.
Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
We're not supposed to PDA.
Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
I can't tell you.
So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...
Is she not going to like that?
It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
I'm just having a little exit interview.
You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
Well, yeah, but you don't need the brochure.  The brochure is up here [indicates head] and it's in here. [indicates heart]
What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn't see it at home, I didn't see it in the bathroom, I didn't see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light...
I'm his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.
I'm cool.
You're not prone to seizures?
No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
Oh, your face!  Oh!
You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
I know, here we go.
I'm just saying, that -
Um...
Hey!
Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
Sure. Thanks for asking.
All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.
Yeah, no... [hurries to get up from chair]
Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
Ahh come on!
Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
You're what, like, 12?
Yep.
Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.
Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
Why?
What?
...all fixtures included. Yes, this is... This is looking good.
Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
Exactly. I know. It's amazing.
There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.
Baby carrots. [Angela sits back down]
I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
What do you want Dwight?
What does that even mean? What are you... What are you talking about?
Uh, I'll drive.
You were surprised, weren't you?
So how are things going with Andy?
How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. [takes back the info flyer Justin holds] Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
One for me one for Jan.
Oh, my God.
Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?
Okay, go back to the annex.
There he goes. There he goes. [Stanley gets up from his desk, walks into kitchen area]
Ok, I am going to count down from five.
9:00 to 10:00, checked in with receptionist. Met with Jan, RE: log. Lost log. Found log.' '10:00 to 11:00, light salad, three points.' That's on the wrong page.
Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
Well this is it. I am here to see you off.
Affirmative.
You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?
OK. No problem.
So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
Yes.
Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
You got it?
No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.
Really? What's going on?
Oscar, paint ball pellets.
[to Jim] To be married?
Really?
...R-P-E-E-S
I'm starting my own paper company.
Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.
I think the engineer left.
I am suspending you without pay for the rest of the year.
Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
[sitting at her desk] Hey, Kelly.
You had a rough night tonight.  But your life is very good, my friend.  You've got a great job, you... you can have any woman you want, you're good looking, you, you know...
Thank you.
Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.
Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
So, you uh, see the Sixers game last night?
Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?
Yep.
[in video] To Oscar Martinez it's the 'Show Me the Money' award! Yeah!
What do we got?
Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
You know you did.
Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old.
No this is Holly.
No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin's open mouth]
I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
Well... s-sure I can.
Terrific. Good.
You know what the problem is?
[answering phone] Yeah?
[calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.
[holding broccoli in front of Kevin] Eat it.
Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
Hi Donna. It's Michael.
Hey guys.
No, that can't be right.
I won't.
Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.
Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
Ok, alright.
We're making love!
[Pam returns] This is one of our staff.  This is Pam Beesly, [takes piece of paper from Pam] receptionist extraordinaire.
You ready to give me my discount now?
Everybody? If... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...'
Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
[off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook]
[someone coughs] What?
Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables...
You know what. I, um, I'm out the door. I'm going to a meeting. Pam, I'm headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go.
So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, 'Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?' And he looks at me and he says, 'Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.' And I look back at him and I say, 'I feel the need!... The need for tweed.'
You sent him cards? You never met him.
Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don't know whose fault it was.  I wasn't exactly looking at the road.
Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.
[to stewardess] Hi.
[reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he's handing it to him]
No...
I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.
Go to your room young lady!
I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.
Ayyyy!
Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
Okay. Sure.
Yeah?
All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.
I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy.
Yes.
Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.
Bathroom.
You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.
Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don't.  Please.  [kneels in front of desk] Please give me it.
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?
Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
Hmm...
We take separate cars.
Okay! I'm sorry.
I don't know what they're made of.
That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant.
Thank you, Andy.
I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
Ok.
Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.
All righty then, well I see you're going for the whole bored supermodel thing. 'Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?' [takes a drag from an imaginary cigarette] Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
What's that?
My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.
Uh. Dwight.
Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.
Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes.
[moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
[laughs] Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
Sure.
I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
Thanks.
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
Get lost.
Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!
Will you?
I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. [reveals a tiny TV] I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? [moves TV back a couple inches] Voila, right in the wall.
Yes. Count to three, please.
Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
Mmhmm.
All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
[Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!
I'm not your lover! I'm am not Michael Scott, I am Dr. Bergerstein. Your proctologist.
[under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
Women in the workplace... yeah, translation 'I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.' Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!
Okay... [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.
I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, that's for sure.  It'll probably be on a boat.
[accent] Oh, you startled me.  My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can I do you for?
Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
BlackBerry.  Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit?  You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.  [drops BlackBerry on desk]  Excuse me while I type on my Banana.  I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.  [thinks] Apple. [nods]
No he did not. I don't need his permission.
But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
[in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
Sure? Might be a good idea.
Okay.
What table should we take?  So many to choose from.
Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.
You say yes, and we go out.
So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
Exactly that.
I'm hearing you, meeting confirmed.
I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.
Mm-hm.
Just forget it.
Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay.
No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
No--- We're all unstable.
...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!
I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...
Why?
I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.
Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump.'
Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
Assistant to the managed him -
You are my producer, you are a suit.  I am the creative genius.  You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.
Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
Alright, that's the way you want it.
I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.
Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.
Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. [Continues with cod German]
No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
After work you guys...
Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
Dunder Mifflin.
I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
Shut it.  Shut it.
That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
You're a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
Yeah.
Hey, right?
No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can.
No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
Oh this is a good one.
Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!
All right.
Oh, thank you my dear.
And I was about to take her bra off...
That's stupid.
The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
I am going to scare these kids so bad.
The waving?
Pass.
Pass.
[Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how we're gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.
[clears throat]
[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!
Give me the phone.
Don't fold it, though.
Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]
Do you see it?
That's possible. Look into that.
Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
[on speakerphone] Yes?
They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.
Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
These meetings are useless.
Yes.
I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she's allergic to hay. So I said, 'Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks,' and she's like 'I don't like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication.'  And I'm like, 'Well you're really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night.' And she's like, 'What the hell are you talking about?' And I'm like, 'I'm kidding. I didn't put a roof...' [cracks himself up] ... We laughed so hard... It was hilarious... oh... [calms down] So yes, I'm very excited about the Diwali party.
I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don't wanna lose the baby.
Oh, hey, do you still work here?
Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
No, that's skeptical. Do sad.
Dwight, I'm the boss.
Answer the door.
Sabre is changing everything. [Michael and David sitting in hot tub] Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?
Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let's get back in there. [no takers] Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let's go.
No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit]
There's... a name.
Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?
So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se.
What?
Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
Oscar's a douche.
Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
What are you guys talking about?
Uh, just never happened.
Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]
Ohh. May I?
Hi, honey.  You holding up?
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
Wow.  If you wanna cry, that's okay.
Dwight, what is your middle name.
So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...
Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.
Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
Yeah.
That's like...
No, they're just hotties.
Okay.
No.
[sighs] What am I gong to do?  Uh... [chuckles].
Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
[sighs, touches Holly's sweater, cuts off sleeve, chuckles, sees Word document on Holly's computer named 'Dear Michael,' plugs in USB flash drive to copy file from computer]
Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.
I know, it's...
That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there.
Okay... [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!
Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.
Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here?  Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?
Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!
I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.
No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! [everyone claps]
Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.
Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?
How, would you stop interrupting please?
Oh.
You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
I'm not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
[kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.
... proud.
I spy?
[Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.
You guys excited about the party?
You know let me give you some money for this.
That's what she...
No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I don't know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.  Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.  And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.  I hate her.
OK, forget it.
I don't know.  Just felt like taking it off.  Man, work can be just so damn frustrating don't ya think, Jim?
Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.
I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
[exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
Talk! Just talk!
Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
Oh, here we go.
[on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry.
Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
That was not scripted.
One other thing I wanted to...
Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
[making the mouth on his tie talk]  Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs]  That's delicious!  I love it!
Try 'profits'.  No! Try 'Michael Scott'.  'Michael' 'boss' and 'funny'. [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow!  [chuckles]  E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.  [reads e-mail]  'Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late.'  Well, Stanley's an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.
[in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now we're wasting tape.  I'm gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
You're an idiot.
Thank you.
No, you are remembering it wrong.
Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael.
Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
Hey.
Who is?
Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...
There he is! Hello, hello!
It's okay.
So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?
We're done. We're done!
[barges in] Hi.
When will she be ready?
Bend It Like Beckham.'
Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you...
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
[loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
Okay.
I'll work on that-
Well-
I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
Dwight, don't, don't be a suck up.
Shh!
Wow, you're kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?
Oh, my God. Dwight.
Here we go.
What?
Of course not.
Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!
Okay.
[reaching to open door] I'm gonna do it.
They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto  them pills, just in case.
I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.
Thanks a bunch.
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
Son of a bitch.
Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.
Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
Obviously.
Yeah, I will.
[walks in] Morning everyone.
Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]
[chuckles] Hmm... no.
Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
Could I talk to you for a second?
[quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]
Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.
Well, they're good snacks. They're good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin' in the car?
Uh, no, no, no Gould.
It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
I wasn't smiling that time and they can tell too.
Call a client right now.
Well, that...
[in an old man mobster voice] Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over.
Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
What is it?
Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh---  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!
Okay. All right.
Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]
[sings] It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
Hey. Wow.
She's your wife, you idiot.
Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]
All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...
Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
Yes.
Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define 'begin'. I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.
Kevin, do you accept the apology?
No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]
Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?
How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
That's a nice tie.
Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.
It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
Yes.
Number two, we go to the mall...
Hey.
Wow. Things are really picking up.
What is that... word?
Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
You guys...
I won't.
No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids.
Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]
Line.
Mm-hmm.
My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room.
I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]
Pam! It's Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.
[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.
You're sure?
Oh...
Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
Yes. Jim...
Hi, guys.
Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.
No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.
Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like 'Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.' It's very dramatic.  Although, I can't say I was a big fan of  'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.
[holding back tears] Okay...
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
Hi.
Cool.
Nnnngah!
Yeah, I marched on Washington back in the day. I went to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, U.S. Mint, congressman talked to our class. It was pretty cool.
Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?
The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
Haha, we struck the mother load!
Line it up Phyllis.
Alright, that's...
All right, um... sorry.
Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
Uh... that I have not decided yet.
Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.
What part of 'I need to pee' do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
[turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]
No, no, no, I finished all of that.  I'm very fast.  I'm not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am.  But I do say thank ya ma'am.  But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam.  Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam.  If it's consensual.  [cold Jan stare]  We're talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?
Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '
What?
T! Yes! Yes! That is a 'T', and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there.
Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.  [shrugs]
...who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
No it ain't.
Don't you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that's able to eat up that other emails? I read about something like that. Well, I am in America and I am online, so I do think it involves you. Uh-huh. And if I were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler? I'd... Yes, I will hold.
Okay.
I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.
Uh-huh?
Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples.  Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
Wha- what?
We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
If she is, it's working.
Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
Sprinkles?
Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.
Yeah, a little bit.
This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
Yes, Phyl?
Oh, hey.
[exhales] That's true.
He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
I know, I know.  I think it's tiny.  I think it's too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.
You're welcome.
I can do that, it is my office.
Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?
You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.
I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.
So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.
That's really nice of you to say.
I think it went well. I think it was good.
Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
May I have a word with you in my office please?
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
Oh, good. By yourself?
Thank you.
Just - sh -
Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Snack attack time.
Oh, okay.
So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]
All right!
All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
[laughs]
[running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah?
That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
Gimme the bottle, Dwight!
Ayyyy!
Who?
Okay, all right, whatever.
Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else? [points] Yep.
...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.
I don't see a... price.
And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
Are you kidding me?
Good.
Let's, yes?
Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
Bruuuuuuuuuce.
Oh, thank you.
You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
...poop my pants.
That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I... [band starts playing]
Yeah.  Fine.
Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!
Hey, whatcha gettin'?
Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.
This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.
Yeah.
How much time do you think you'll need?
She was kind of tripping me up, cause she was, um, I was trying to get something going, when I was over her with the gun, and she like kept changing the story.
Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
Do you need 'em?
Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.
Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
...Or biologically.
Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]
He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.
Internet.
Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!
That's, that is true. [clip montage]
Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.
Problem. Good.
So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
Here we go.
Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?
Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
Having fun?
[notices Karen's pregnant] Oh my God. Is that Jim's?
No, no, no.
What's happening?
You, you like that?
You are so brave. You are so brave.
I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha.
I... really want to keep you.
We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
No, never heard of it.  No, a
Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
No.
Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.
...Where did you get that information.
Okay.
100 dollars, great.
...Chunky. Do you want half?
Oh my god. Was she cute?
You should see the other guy.
And many more!
Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.
Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
There's no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell 'em that?
Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
That's what she said.
I said no.
[knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
To the left?
I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!
Great
[mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.
It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
It's a fake wheel, dummy.
Come on, Ryan...
Okay.
Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
Okay!
Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle!
Okay.
Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.
Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.
No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?
That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...
Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed.
If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
He said no.
Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.
Yes, you are.  And you know what you're going to have?
I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
Did it work?
Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don't believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.
Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That's -
Testify.
...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]
We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.
Nice!
[Michael is singing to the tune of 'Tiny Dancer' by Elton John] 'You have won a tiny Dundie.'
Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
No. There's no one else.
Would you excuse me for a second?
Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest.
Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
I know. God! What is that?
[answers cell] What do you want?
You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
Hey, Stanley.
Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it.
Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.
Do you want me to find out what it says?
And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim's desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.
Is who a Michael what?
Before we continue, I would like to make an opening statement.
Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. [Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party.
Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.
Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
[laughs] Which one is that again?
[laughs]
We go to the bed store, I let her choose whatever bed she wants...
Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
It looks cute though.
Busted.
Nope. The opposite of that.
[entering the elevator] Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!
No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.
Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.
Just do it.
Yeah.
No, I got it.
This way to the partay bus.
Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
Oh, OK.
Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
[helping Ryan out of the taxi] Come on, come on.
Thank you.
Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.
Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody'd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? [pause] Three hours. We're half way done.
Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
[on Youtube video] There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. [phone rings, Michael picks it up] Michael Scott, as seen on TV.
Bringing home the bacon.
Bail'er?  I hardly know her.
No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.
[reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'
Listen, Dwight.
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.
[sigh] Something with a 'K'.
Like the movie.
No.
Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
OK, let me be.
Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
Well...
Oh- She's not here?
I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
Did Darryl touch you?
I am the fat accountant.
Look at him, he's laughing.
Just say the word.
That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
Yeah, good job. Well done.
Oh!
You can do it, just say it.
This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
No it's not.
What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls.
Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry.
Mmm hmm. I like 'em.
That's it?
Right here.  We have a lot of fun.
Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
See you.
Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
Oh, yeah.
Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?
Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
Perfect crime.
Well, let's...
This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
Not.  Good.  Enough!
Yes, please.
Okay. Rule five - safety first,  i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.
Why?
Charley horse!
Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
What makes them so good?
[blues singer] Da  na na na na...
Messages?
I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
Okay.
Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at-- [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that's... [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It's like another seven hours.
Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
Like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look. Okay, we're done. Is that your stomach? I keep hearing somebody's stomach. [whispers] God.
It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
Aww, none of your business.
Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. [Michael dials phone number. Phone rings.]
Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life. [whispers to camera] saved it.
That's right.
You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.
I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
Thank you, Kevin.
Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.
So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so...
People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
Hey thanks. Thank you.
Ignore him.  You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...
Ah, yes. Ah. [laughs]
Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?
You are lying right now.
Blue's not a flavor.
Really?
What did I say?
[hangs up]
Not yet!
This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.
Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
Who is this?  How did you get this number?
Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -
Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.
...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.
[laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
You look great.
Forget it! Forget it!
Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?
Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
She has a boyfriend.
The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.
I'm not, I'm not getting married. So... [laughs] Psych.
Shoot, shoot it.  [Roy hits Jim in the mouth with his elbow] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression!  Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up.
Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
All right. Good. Thank you. [Andy picks a card] Do not look at your card. Now, I've always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here [puts hand over heart]. So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.
Have you ever seen Santa?
Blech.
Oh, new record!
That's what she said.
Humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-humuna-
I just don't want you to.
Hello, Holly.
Yes.
Okay.
[Pam knocks on his door] Go away.
okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?
Damn it Kevin, come on.
I don't know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.
Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?
They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level]
Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
Don't ape me.
[whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
Hey...
You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?
So check out how we live
Get out.
And now, presenting...
No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.
Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, 'That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole...' I dunno, it's a good feeling.
What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well... [to Brenda] Tell you about Toby later, he's awful.
No, no, no.
Oh my God! [sprays champagne on Erin]
Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
Hello.
Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
If you'll have me, yes.
Vikram doesn't have my people skills.
Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?
[long pause] Yes.
Nn--- Depression.
My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
[laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...
I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you're still sick.  So have a great long weekend.
Hello ladies, how's my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
We don't know if it's dead.
No, I'm just poopin'.  You know how I be.
Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh.
[Creed is using the toaster as a mirror, and touching up his hair with a Sharpie and a comb] The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them.  And old enough to know the difference between the two.  I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls.  But old enough to know better.  I'm at a perfect age.  I could die now.  But I won't, because I am young.
Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.
Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.
And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar.  Use your imagination.
Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
I'm sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
Oh, OK.
What? Shut up.
Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that's called sales.
Let's get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in]
Now is really not the time, Meredith.
Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
It's not a Jewish joke, so don't worry.
Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.
When in Rome.
Oh God-
Why don't you tell us?
In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.' [laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that. Doh! Hogan! Not again, Hogan! Get Col. Burkhalter on the phone! [laughing] I'm kind of a Hogan around here. And kind of, Jan is kind of Col. Burkhalter, then Dwight is Schultz. But, it's... Oh, God. We have fun. We have fun. 'Cause he's gonna be pissed. [making voice] No doubt about it.
Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-
Come on.
What?
What is your problem?!
Okay, well, I made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out, in case you're ever tempted. So there you go. And, Dwight, you know, I'm very busy today. It wasn't even planning on going to the bathroom, so I don't even know if anything will come out.
Everybody.  He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me.
What?
Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
We're okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?
Don't get hysterical.
Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.
Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
Hmm..
It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.
No.
Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.
Nobody cares what you think.
Fillipellers, how's it hanging?
Okay.
It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.
Oh, I dunno about that.
That is ridiculous.
Indubitably.
As I was saying it.
What is October feast?
Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
It's okay.  It's okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.
Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy.
Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
Hello.  Scott.  Table for four.
- since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?
Everyone, now [bleep] calm down!
Yes, yes.  But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?
One hour.
Oh God.  Well, that's an interesting theory.
Oh! You got it? What is that? [Dwight building his gift]
No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
Well-
I don't know, actually.
The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
You don't have all the facts.
Oh! Hey. What is this about?
[clapping] Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.
What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
That good?
Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...
Whatever, yeah.
No... that's...
I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
That's over several months, Ryan.
Oh, wow! What did you do?
Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.
[talking over Jan] You're glad?
Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.
It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
David, I did not tell her.
Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. [they continue arguing]
I'll take care of that for you. [crumples receipt and throws it in trash] Thanks.
Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
Good.
Hello!
Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
[holding up a Dundie and pretending it is talking] Hello. I'm Michael Scott. I'm the best boss in the world.
And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
Just cover up that bald patch.
The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
[in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
Handed to me as I sat down.  This was my hot towel.  It is still wet.
Yeah, yeah he is the worst.
I will divide and then count to it.
No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
Yeah.
Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
OK.
[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed]
They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
Where are the yams?
Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks]
Oh.
She's nice.
First guy says 'Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn'.  And the second guy says, 'Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort'.  And the third guy says 'I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe'.
No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.
No, no. What do I do?
Good, it's good.  Good work, everybody.
I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. [makes a gasping sound]
Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
What?  What does that even...
What? Come on. It's time for grapes. [regular voice] Real fun day.
Mm-hmm.
Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
Which will be fine. I am off!
I like that, so manager and co-manager.
I got it on a website, that's not important.
In your face
I can't get out of it!
Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
Really?
This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way: when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
Ok yes, I would never do that.
Yeah, oh there you go.
Nope, nope.  I actually wear a turban sometimes.  Wanna see it?
[follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That's insane.
Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.
The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]
I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
That is neat.
Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.
Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- [phone rings]
Dwight, little help with the bags, please.
It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
That would be sublime.
Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.
What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.
Well...
Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-
[in parking lot, blocking path of Stanley's car] Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. [Stanley honks horn repeatedly] Stanley, are you having an affair?
You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
What? [toilet flushing] What are you doing in there?
This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!
It's true.
Yeppers.
Where's the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.
No.
That's just an arbitrary title.
Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
Are you talking to me?
[singing] You down with the Dundies?
Hi, is it over?
Sorry, too busy can't even come to the door.
This was Jim's idea?
Leaving Pennsylvania.
You're welcome.
You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
Really?
You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
Okay, can I have that?
[over PA] This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. [snickering] I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. [wheezing laughing, starts coughing] Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it.
Dwight, you gotta move!
I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
No!  Oh my God!
Do not talk like that, Stanley.
OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
You know what we should do?
[the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
Aw, it's alright.
At all!
Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.
Traitor. You are a traitor.
How'd you even find it?
[in Jim's office] How you doing?
OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, 'Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.'
Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
[fake kicks in door] Boom! Detective Michael Scarn.  I'm with the FBI.
I'm looking for the toy drive box.
No do it, do it.  I dare you.
Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
How would I know?
Ok. Yeah, what, what?
I know.
Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?
I...
Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh! [Clutches chest and falls to the floor]
I'm right here, I'm right here.
People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
I want it...
Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
[Jim has the ball] Jim! Jim! Right here! [runs into the elbow of the guy guarding him] Ow! God! Hold it!
I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success.
Okay. Talk to you Monday.
How did you...
Yes...
Hey, what time is it?
Yes, thank you.
You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
I need to have her say...
Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, 'Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.' His words.
Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.
Thank you so much.
Dwight. Hey!
What?
Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...
Fine. If you are so anxious to see a head roll, it's you. There. You brought it on yourself. Too bad. Can't say that I'm sorry. It's a relief.
Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away.
I don't want to do that. [chanting continues] All right. [picks up phone and dials] She is going to freak out!
I'm really sorry.
[hangs up phone and walks back into conference room] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
You can get up.  Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, bitch.  [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace]
I'm digging.
Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
How do you mean?
Do I look okay?
Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
Stupid.
That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
No... No...
[sighs] All right.
Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please.  Very rude.  You're ruining the party.
[staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin'?
Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
Really? You told on me. That's lame.
Yes, we did.
...come on, Jan!
That's true.  People say it's icky.
No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
I'm not gonna date a 55-year-old woman.
Oooh!
You should give them a call. Check that out.
Go!
No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
Hey.
[gets up and begins to walk out of the room]
Yeah, I'm good. You good?
What are you doing?
These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.
And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.  There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor [Oscar vigorously shakes his head]  What?
Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]
Ah! Ha ha ha!
Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. [Stanley looks angry] But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! [Stanley slowly walks over, angry] Come on up here you sick bastard.
OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
Hannah?
Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---
Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.
Ach, [to Darryl quietly] okay, okay, play the cutoff music.
Don't...
We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.
Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?
Pam, please clear my phone lines.
Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
I haven't told you about her.
Sales.
I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.
All right, our next award... ah, yes, this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies' room wall, and the winner is... Who is it? Who wants to claim it? Shiny Dundie. Who wrote it? Great idea, Dwight.
Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Good, good, good. I will see you.
OK, come on everybody, go time. Pam let's go.
This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
Your problem now, Captain Jack.
In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure.
A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
Took me all night.
I need somebody to pick a card. [Dwight raises hand] One of the new people, please? Tony? [Tony walks away]
Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
Oh... ah, I almost choked.
Are you kidding me?
...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
You do?
We did it!
Great.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
Yes.  Thank you.
Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. [points to Pam's' pregnant tummy]
Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
Hi Ben, Michael Scott.
What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse.
OK.
[to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.
No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie...
Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.
[waiting on Pam to be done with the microwave] Ahhhhhhhhh. [whispering loudly] I'm hungry.
Many women
Okay.
Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
Well, we are extremely sorry.
Okay...
Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.
No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
Yeah. Right, snuggle time.
Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed. [cheers and applause] It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars. [auctioneer voice] 300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400-[speaking gibberish] Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450 [speaking gibberish] Sold! For 300 dollars to me! [bangs gavel, which squeaks] What the hell is that?
Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? [laughs]
I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
[holding a chainsaw] And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.'
How you doing stud? You already there?
Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!
The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
Me had an i-rey time.
Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.
Good morning.
Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show's just getting started.
Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.
And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]
Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
No.
Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
Because he wasn't following the rules.
Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.
Okay.
Oh, my God, what happened?
Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
Okay.
Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.
Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
[pats face] Oh that feels better.
Yup.
Everything here was made in China, Pam.
Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.
It's bad.
What is Diwali?
Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous?
What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir.
Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.
Well, you're not a romantic.
You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
[groans painfully]
[mouth full of brownie] Just stop it.  You haven't done anything helpful all day.
So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
Yes! Thank you. God. She gets it. [laughs] We just picked the best one right? Just had it.
Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh... Do you have laser tag down there or something?
Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.
It had to be done, it had to be done.
How do you know Michael Clump?
[Jim pushes Roy to the ground and makes another shot] Yes!
---rolled into one.
Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist.
I don't want to say. But, 'it's fun to stay at the -' [nods to fill in blank, but Dwight doesn't know]
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
Ryan.
I could not have agreed with you more.
[standing on tractor trailer with Dwight and Andy, looking down] Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
I, uh... I am going to be a father.
Okay. What do you think?
Yeah.
Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
Let's do this.
Are we ready?
[still on phone with Holly] Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?
And next to your kids. What?
Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter?  What's the matter? You scared?
Okay!
Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.
Well, who's that one?
Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A 'Michael-idea' folder?
Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
They're good [Donna grabs mint]
Toaster Oven 101?
Mm-Hmm.
Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
This is it.
Pssh, kay.
Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
It's nice to see you doing so well.
Yeah.
Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?
Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
And shake! What? Go ahead.
If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
Ohh... kay.
Sounds good. Okay, let's go.
Um, oh, thinking about business school?
Yep.
Like... I don't... I don't know.
Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth]
Go, here we go!
[thinks a moment] Sounds great.
Oh, thank you.
Yes, she is nuts.
Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.
Yeah.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? [phone rings] Heh-woh you.
Come on.
Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
I'll be down in just a second. [into house] Holly?
Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?
Coffee?
He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
Nice dress, Ryan.
Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .
Do you know anybody in the mob?
Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
[Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar]  Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!
Ah. Small?
No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
Yeah.
[talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we --[Dwight counts the raised hands] Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
I don't.
[clears throat] No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One 'o clock. Big game, big game.
No.  No it's not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people 'faggie' since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
Well... bleh busted.  I don't...
[interrupting] No.
David, how much did this house cost?
No, no, no!  Seriously, I don't mind sharing.
But before that, I have to do my presentation.
This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.
I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
Um, what do you play? Center?
I do. It's right here. [indicates to waist]
Hey. What are you doing?
Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
Just-what's going on?
Did you pee on a stick?
Yes, it is.
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
Idiot.
Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
Good trip down?
No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
Hmm.
And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...
Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
No!  No!  Jim, Jim, don't, don't...
Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
[mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
Two are for souvenirs.
Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
A.J.
Sexual time bomb.
Oh, god!
Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
What are you looking for? You bring dip?
[on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...
No.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you this, it is
Allergies?
[give Kevin his award]There you go.
[sighs] It's not ready yet.
[over phone]  Is that Pam?  Hey, have her come out!  Have her come out!  It would be like Coyote Ugly.
Okay.
No, not at all come on in. [Toby signing the birthday card] No, no. You can't. No, red hair is my area. We have it on tape, so...
Wh-Why not?
Mmhmm, bravo!
Okay.
Yup, I'm good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch.
And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
Yes, Andy.
If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.
It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place.  Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds...
Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item. [cheering] All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?
What can I do?
Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
Calling from... [Ryan hangs up]
Ok. [beeping slows down]
No, that wouldn't be--
What?
Thanks, Steve.
Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
Okay, just summarize.
Easy.
[Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses.
It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
Did you have a good weekend going there?
I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don't... You don't call retarded people 'retards'.  It's bad taste.  You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.
Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.
I feel you.
That was mean.
Hi Santa.
Yes I do.
I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
A what?
Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...
No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right?
Never missed a day, my ass.
No...
1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. [applause] Nicely done.
Yes.
Don't... is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.
[walks into room] Okay.
...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.
So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
Shh.
No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
Well done.
How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
Previously on Varsity Blues...
Oh, okay.
Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
I...
Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
Oh, nerd alert!
I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.
I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. [starts singing] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.
That's... Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there. [Dwight digs hole in ground] Just dig.
We have to have done something wrong.
He hasn't changed.
I'm not.  It's solitaire.  See?
Why would we do that?
[talking to an attractive woman] Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.
Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going.
Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including 'Stanley is having an affair.' It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
Good. Great.
Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
Are you pulling my leg or...
I have a right mind to shoot you right in the head.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
That look?
No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
Cow surfing?
[on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done.
Mmm-hmm.
Some people need dozens of friends to say, 'Hey, look at me, I'm popular.' But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.
Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.
You'll break it.
Yeah, baby, here we go!
All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?
Yeah.
He's right there.  There he is.
Okay.
Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go!  OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke.  OK, let's do it.
You know what? That's my foot.
This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.
[Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you?
Oh, yeah right.
You can train him.  He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.
I won't
[imitating E.T.] Not Michael, E.T.
You don't have one single girlfriend?
You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves]
Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?
Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. [Angela claps] Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget.
If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
[rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
No. [laughs]
What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]
You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have?
Here we go.
You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke.
What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
No, Baah! But he's married to her!
My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. [a couple of sounds play on the computer] That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...
They did this up in Albany...
You gotta do something--
Anything goes.
[runs down to parking lot, sighs]
Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better.  My body's literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
I'm not worried.
Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.
Can I hold her?
We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. [David Wallace walks in] Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!
[knocks on door] Hello, hello!
I don't know what I'm gonna do!
[knocking on door] Hmm?
It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I can't remember why I came over here. Ha, ha.
This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. [to Toby] Right? Would you agree with that?
I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. [hangs up] Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith's problem?
Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
Yeah?
Oh... [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
Can we have the room please?
Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
David, wait.
Oh, wow!
OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
So I looked him in the eye and I said, 'Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead.' I said something like that.
Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
Do you really wanna know?
Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.
I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.
Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, [cut to Dwight standing on a box with 'LIAR' written on a piece of paper hung around his neck, Dwight's head hung in shame] and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.
Show time! It's show time!
Dwight, what are you drinking?
No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.
[wandering around the room during his diversity exercise] I want you to push it. I want you to push 'cause breakthroughs are right around the corner. Something's going to pop here. Something's going to pop between a party. Feel what it's like to be in someone else's skin. What does it feel like to be a different race? It feels pretty bad doesn't it. So let that come out.
Alright.
Mmm!
Okay. Thank you.
Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]
Oh, she is hot. ['Hillary Swank is hot' supporters cheer]
So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
Could have gone better I guess.
You are relieved.
... Okay.
What kind of toppings would you like?
It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott.
OK. Cool, you're on. [to Dwight] Don't screw this up.
Okay.
Yeah.
Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
We were more than we were.
[looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?
On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.
W-why did you...
[Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this.
Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
Pam, translate.
Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didn't want hers.  Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
Ughh... Blech.
Okay, are you cool, really?
Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.
I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
Oh... ok.
Oh, don't start,
Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
Yeah. Go ahead.
I don't wanna talk about it.  I just wanna hang out, just be one of the guys.
Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
Alright. No more meetings this week.
Yeah.
It's a heart.
Idiot.
Yeah.
A DSi?
I'm in.
Oh, so you're not gonna play?  She's not playing.
Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em.
Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.
No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
[laughing] What was that?
OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
What's that?
Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.
You think she'd talk to you?
Can't we all get along?  No, we can't. But here's the thing: yes, we can. Well, why not? Because of differeneces. Well, can we overcome these differences?  No. Can we find each other and connect with each other in spite of these differences? No, we can't. But, we have to try and that is why I created the Integration Celebration.
You are-
I do okay.
[concerned] Why?
We should invite them to the Christmas party.
So how you feeling about the new company?
What's that?
Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
[just hugs her, and she hugs him back and smiles] You wanna go out?
Banana fana fo fanley.
I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
Okay.
This is plenty complicated.
Thank you.
I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: 'Holly, you and I are soup snakes.' The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
Jan in yet?
Son of a bitch. [enters conference room] Pardon me.
Or some tea or hummus or something?
Oh, that's a good idea.
I'll get it.
Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?
Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?
And what is that?
Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm  against violence in the workplace.
You understand? You... you get this check.
Yeah.  What?
Yes! Yes! All right. We got game!
Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, 'Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it.' And 'Border-line harassment when you call me at home.' But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.
Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.
You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs]
I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
Morning everyone.  Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.
[knocks] Hey, what's going on?
Yes?
Thank you, Jim is with me.
Yeeesh.
Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
I love it!
[mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.
HR stuff? [pulls up a chair] HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley. [pointing to Eric's notes] What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
I didn't mean me!
There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
[unwraps rum gift] Oh, wow.
Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
Hey! Hi, good to see you.
Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
Oh.  [laughs and claps] Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!
It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.
What?
[seems taken aback] Uhm...
[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that's right.  It's a baby, see?
Kevin, stay.
[rubbing noses with Holly] You're the one.
And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
[on the phone] Hey Howard. Michael Scott here. Yeah, sorry about that. Dwight is an idiot. I know. No, he's a little... Little dim. He's the janitor's brother, so...
That's... I, I think that...
[to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes']
Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.
Just let go.
A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]
I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, 'I don't respect you!' Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. [as Borat] Respect is niiice. Borat. [as Rodney Dangerfield] What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!
[Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?
Alright, alright.
[approaching Kelly's desk, whispering] Stanley is having an affir.
Oh yeah.
Alright.
Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.
You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
He gives the best back rubs in the office.
What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Just hit me. You'll see.
Here we go.
[watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
Oh. [scoffs] Come on.  Be serious.
Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
I don't know.
Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks...
I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
Well...
When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
So much for keeping our secrets up high.
And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.
Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down.  You and I-
I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.
Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?
Yeah.
Shh.
I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
No, he's not.
[imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs]
Good. Yep.
Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.'  And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-
Uhhgh.
Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
Check that out, huh?
I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?
M-hmm.
You shouldn't have been, 'cause you were dealing with Michael Scarn.  That was exactly what I was hoping to achieve, so that is probably the best thing you could have said, that's a compliment.
Hamster.
Jan... Ryan.
Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...
You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. 'Michael, buy a motorcycle.' So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.
Are you kidding me?  That's my salad.
Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  I'm scared I'm gonna love it.  [claps hands] Let's do this.
Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.
Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
There they are. What's up? Hey hey.
I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
[to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
[watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No.
We already have a buyer.
[whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. [camera pans down from Michael's office window to parking lot below, Stanley is seen destroying Michael's Sebring with a crowbar] Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess [Jim is seen displaying fetus picture on his desk as Pam smiles] and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try.
I'm turning myself in right now!
Hey.
Sorry I was a jerk.
Yes.
Yes I was. Yes I was.
What do you say, Jan?
But the branch is still mine?
How so, specifically?
You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
Well some of us are trying to have a...
Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin'?
Oh...
Ok, ok...
Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay.
What would you like for Christmas little boy?
Thank you.
Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
Please?
Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]
Stephanie could you hop off please?
[sitting in Holly's lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...
We're havin a little brainstorm session...
Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.
[mumbling] Should I... turn, no. Do it again.
Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely.
I'd like to make a wish.
[on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.
Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...
Are you all afwaid?
Hi, Jan.  How are you?
Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -
Apollo Creed.
Ah, what? Which memo?
My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case Logic
Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
Oh, already.
That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
Really?
Hey, you don't deserve her.
Geesh, Dwight!
It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
You'll figure it out.
I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.
And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
Where you going?
I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.
Uh, they look that good? Wow. [Mike Myers voice] Oh, Pam please behave. Mike Myers, genius. Um, no actually I got them at a fancier place. Target.
I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?
Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend ---
Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
Woo!
Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
That's great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  [laughs] See?  Everybody has a chance!
I love this woman!
Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
It's Grotti. He's following up.
Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.
Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
Totally your call babe.
Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
Are you okay?
[on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
Per mile, yes.
I'm going to have to do this Sopranos-style. Just whack him. Guys, could you take the freight elevator, please?
Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
Monkey see, monkey do.
Funny story: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv.  The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says 'Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.' [giggles]  And that was an improv.  Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.
Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm...
I'm just getting hardcore with him.
I do not understand what you spend your money on.
I am Beyonce always.
Hello, Jan.
Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The 'Hottest in the Office' award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
Who do you think it should be?
And, ditto.
And still rockin', Oscar.  One of the greatest all-time oldies was a little Oriental guy named Confucius.  He literally invented the ancient Chinese secret.  Here's some of his quotes.  Confucius say, 'Man who farts in church must sit in his own pew.'  Confucius say, 'Man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day.'  Confucius also say, 'Virgin like balloon.  One prick, all gone!'
You get me.
No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
[to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...
Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt. [Phyllis gets up and leaves the party]
Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.
Whoo!
Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun.
She's kind of a rube.
You're gonna be okay, it's gonna...
Ahhh! Excellent.
Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.
I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
We did it? We did it.
Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What's the... oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?
Hey, you. Big Jim. And Phyllis. Working hard, Phyllis?
I do understand it.
You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?
Um, I'll... I have to think about it.
Like it.
Oh my God.
Stanley! Bo banley.
What are you doing?
Yeeesh.
I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?
You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham]
Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
Um.
Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So...
It was
Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
Crazy.
Ok.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
The what now?
I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes]
[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?
Yeah?
[sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
Oh, good.
Yeah, I figured that.
Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.
I don't need to be friends with Pam.  I have plenty of female friends.  My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.
It was the warehouse guys...
Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building.
That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
I looked at Wallace and I said 'I quit!' and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said 'You have no idea how high I can fly.'
Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
No.
I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. [Erin laughs] I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
[sigh]
Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
Da  na na na na.
Me too.
[singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]
Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.
Helene?
[on microphone] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?
Ah, look at me. I'm huge in Wilkes-Barre. Performing nightly, Michael Scott. Not comedy fans here, which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one. Questions? Comment? Can't see you, but I know that you're not breathing. I know you're breathing. Is this on? Hello? 'Well, isn't that... Well, isn't that special?' 'Jell-O pudding.' Bill Cosby. I think Bill Cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he... All the great things they did together as kids. And there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer, and it... And he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it... He would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn't throw it. So... Bill Cosby is smoking! And now some race car. [imitating race car engine] That brings me to my... Brings me to a point that you should always have a list of your clients. It's important to because a client list is next to godliness... List. [baby crying] Could you shut him up, please? I mean, who brings a baby to a sales conference? Really rude.
TMI. Too much information. I used to say, 'Don't go there,' but that is so lame now. Or, 'You go, girl.' Or... Um, when did 'Where's the beef?' That was, like, a long, long time ago. It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, 'Too much information' probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently. Um, but you know, they're generally good for, like, no more than five or six years.
So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
[as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
[sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. 'Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?' You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
Ah, you do. So...
Wow, I don't want to hear... you talk.  Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?  [stumbling] Oh, oh, oh.  Alright.
No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  ...  Only on the rarest of occasions...
You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can't go through with this.
Kevin, I have something for you.
Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
Okay, Okay, we don't have much time.  Just act normal.  Don't look at me people. Stop.  Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me.  Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.  You're older, and you are very happy now.  Because you went with Michael Scott.  Right.  So everybody come on down.  Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright?  Come on!  Are you, are you doing your best here?  Are you being the best that you can be?  [Pam is thinking hard] Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot.  Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me.  Come on Phyllis.  Here we go, here we go!
What's up spinsters?
Okay. [starts round of applause]
[Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What's the matter?
Do you think they have any s'mores?
Crazy world.  Lotta smells.
And you're okay with that?
I just saw him.
So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.
Hey.
Hello Jo.
[sighs loudly] Does it feel good?
[sees Jan sizing up Holly] I'm fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
And it also helps if you've had five shots.
I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
Idiot.
[walking around and greeting people] How are you? Good morning. Good morning.
Introduce yourself. Be polite.
Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange [points to Andy]
[points at camera] They're gonna have... You can't say that, all right?
Hey, Stanley, in case I don't see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash. Keep the change. [hands Stanley a piece of Jamaican currency]
No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---
Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
It's just that you never got married and you live in an apartment.
Pretty nice.
All right.
...contemporary townhouse. Two car parking...
I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone?
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
Cow surfing. [spots a cow out the window] Okay, here we go, there's a cow.
Herpes duplex.
Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything?
No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim?
Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?
Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
[laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
No. What is his name?
Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.
Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of 'em.
No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time?  In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.  In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom.  This is considered to be polite.
You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
Stay, stay.
Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
Very good.
Go home, Toby. Just...
I have rights.
OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
[laughs] Yeah. That would be perfect.
Oh, that hurts.
Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
Gin. [toast, sip]
I'm just walking around.
Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?
[to David] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
I... love it!! Haha, come on!
No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
Cool, cool. Box it up.
Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
I don't mind if I do.
Okay. Alright. Cool.  See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby's desk] Oh, she's cute.  Cutie-pie. Back to work.
[into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
Okay.
Yeah. Quiz me.
Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.
[from his office] That's what she said.
...what?
Have a seat.
You're welcome.
Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
I'm putting my bed right over here.
No, I'm not trying to trick him. I'm trying to be a good mentor. So...
Ok?
Good stuff.  All right.   Let's get down to some wine drinking.
They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
I don't understand.
Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.
[still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
Uh, wh-why would she say that?
Who should it come from, then?
The watermark... it's a one time thing.
Do I need to speak up? [grabs boom microphone] Hello.
What are you doing?
Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
[in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson.
You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that.
Yes.
Mm-hmm?
Come on! Phyllis!
Oh.
Jim? Pam?
Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn't be here tonight...
I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
Feelin' hot, hot, hot! [playing conch shell] Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.
Yes.
Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.
I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question: do I do it as the man?  Does she do it as my superior?  I don't know.  That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship.  It's, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me.  Hello?  Hi!  Just talking about you.  The camera?  No.  Uh huh.  How's traffic?  I miss you.  What.  Ok.  Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake.  No. [to camera]  Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm.  No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have.  Right.  No.  Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people.  Only other people.  Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  [to Jan] I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no.  I didn't slip you something!
Well... [exhales] OK, well...  Um, wasn't really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?
Sure it is.
Hey.
Because we work together.
[wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.
I fell off the toilet.  I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
I don't understand?
Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?
There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
Oh, you're sorry?
Mmm.
What you mean uh hmmm... ?
Did everybody know about this but me?
Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
[sighs] Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
What I want all of you [points at Scranton branch] to do is approach one of the new people and tell them the one thing that you like most about them. Who wants to start? Who wants to give it a shot?
Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.
Well...
I know, I know. You're right, you're right.
I know.
Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.
There. I'm doing it. Right there. Great.
Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?
Well it sounds right, but is it?
[muffled] That's what she said.
[hits Pam in the head with a piece of paper] Off the backboard!
Hm? Okay. Yep.
[filming video] Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not.
You're right, you're right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok.
It's my sumo suit.  I just didn't inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that.
There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?
I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
Well what am I supposed to do?
Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?
Sum it up Darryl, sum it up.
Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
Okay, security guard.
That's not what you said earlier.
Excuse me, everyone... SEX! Now that I have your attention...
No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
Where you from?
I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  He'll call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, he'll call.  If he doesn't, he is loco.
Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why don't you just go... away?
To watch tonight
Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
No.
Damn it.
Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff]
I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
[same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
[performs magic-tricks while lip-syncing]
This is it. What do you think?
Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
[flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
Hey, congrats on the bonus.
Hm?
Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
I did!
Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
Okay.
Uh huh.
...between us.
Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
I'm not going get a brain-
Oh... okay. [looks back at Andy and Oscar] Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap.  I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold.  I will don it... and oh! Look at that.  I can't see because I am in a-- [cart crashes into Michael's leg] GAH!
Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
People have been filtering in and out.
Yeah.
Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
What are you doing? ['Goodbye My Lover' by James Blunt plays]
Yeah.
I totally agree with you.  But I don't have money problems, I don't.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]
Welcome.
One more time. [singing] You...
Yep.
No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.
Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
I will do my
Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]
Turn around, turn around. Come on. [making a body turning gesture]
All right! Thank you!
[goes up to concierge from the hotel] Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott.  Good to see you again.
Yeah, I know.
It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.
Island living. You know?
You're all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly. [phone rings, Phyllis reaches to answer]  No.  NO!  [phone continues to ring]
Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.
Ugh.
Hey, Carol.
There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit.  At the very least it's bisexual.
Would you look at that? [Hugs Ryan] [Dwight attempts hug] Damn it, Dwight! Come on.
No. Absolutely not.
Stanley!  What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! [Roy steals the ball, and goes for a lay up] Oh... Here we go! [Lonny shoots and makes it] Who's on him? Somebody get him!
Sign the papers at the condo.
Cool, so maybe hook me up  with some Fleebulls and some Hive.
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
Hey guys.
It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, 'You're fired.' [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed.' It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed.'  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, 'You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want.' But that's unrealistic, so...
It's got a lot of me.
Gah, the dreadmill. [both laugh]
Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]
There's always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just nature's rule.  It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler.
Okay. [sits back down to continue eating]
[as Mikanos] Hello.
Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
Yes.
I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.
Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
You writing your memoirs over there?
Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
Guilty! Guilty as charged!
Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]
Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.
Thank you! [gets into his car]
Alright, I'm ready here.
Get me Armani.
Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?
Okay, Dwight.
Dwight, find out what the present is.
No, no.
Nothing. Cocoa.
I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
Back to work.
You don't have to say it like that.
Too expensive.
Exactly.
You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.
Gahh, I will pull this car over!
Okay.
You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?
No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
Ah...
...calendar.
There was no other guest the entire time I was here.
It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
What if they made out? In front of everybody?
[passes Isabel] Hey, good morning.  [to Dwight] It's about damn time.  I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.  [walks into hotel room]  Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.
You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
No. Dwight. I'm fine.
Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there.
Ok, let's try another one.  Um...
Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks. [goes to stand on desk] Just stand right up.
Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
Yeah.  Mmmmmm.
Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
I do, too. I do, too.
It's not scary.
That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
[sighs] I don't deserve this, guys.
Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.
In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! [imitates vacuum cleaner] I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. [humming theme music] Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.
What? What I'm saying...
Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino.
Hey, buddy.
This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone.
I know just he place.
I appreciate that, thank you.
I have to hear it from her.
Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
The sales department smashed my sandwich.
No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
Get out.
What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
I don't know that.
I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
Whoa, whoa!
Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well... Jim?
All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
[imitating E.T.] Why?
Ugh.
Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
Okay.  Um, her.
Alright, well, cool. [Michael walks by Jim] Still deciding?
I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
Welcome back!  How was your vacation?
Oh shhhh--oot!
You mean cancer?
Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six. [later in his office, places a band-aid over his cold sore]
Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
I was breathing.
What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.
Ssshh stupid! Um...
So this is our sales staff. They are the ones who are making calls and making us lots of money. [comes to a screeching halt and laughs] This is accounting. The numbers dudes. Do not let the job description fool you, they are all completely crazy. Especially that guy, he is a mental patient. [camera zooms in on Kevin] Not literally of course, that wouldn't work. The last place you'd want somebody like that is accounting. [hides behind office plant] 'Very interesting, but stupid.' Artie Johnson. It's a crazy place.
Yes.
Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...
That's... What do you mean, 'Michael'? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
It's all... [Pam walks away.] OK.
Yes.
Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
Yeah.
Jim, could you come in here please?
Okay. All right.
You and your wife, and you have kids.
Kelly?
Yes, that's a good idea.
Well, he
Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
Hey, if anybody wants to go...
And there's our smudgeness.
Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
Pretty weird. [Dwight and tall girl run out of club]
For instance, why don't you go to business...
Yes!
How about some Splenda?
I know, I know.
You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...
OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts.
Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
Alright!
Give me the bottle!!
I am telling Andy.
Hey.
[walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now.  I will... I love you too.  Bye.
Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, 'So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?'
Well, it is time to call in a little favor. A buddy of mine runs this tourist attraction, actually it's big. It's probably one of the most popular in the state. So...
Mmm... okay.
They have a TCBY booth.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
[talking quietly, trying not to move his lips]That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
They're cool.
You ready to do this?
Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.
What a douche bag!
[off camera] That's terrible.
Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
Okay. Okay.
[as Mikanos] Practice Olympics.
Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.
This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will 'do' you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
Hi, Jan!
Look, my clothes are so wet!
So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
Look who you're talking to.
Ah, so when did you set up shop?
I'm not giving that to you.
Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking]
Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]
Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That's how  the game's played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
Ha.
Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.
No, no, no!  That's enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.
Is it?
Buddha.
[arriving at a dumpy looking, unkempt house] I've never seen this place in the daylight.
Wait a second.  That's Weekend at Bernie's. [upset] Do you think that this is a game?
Wow.
A fairy princess. You're very... .
Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
Do I know a Carol Stills?
Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim's pass] Whoa!
Oh, why do I feel like crap?
There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck].
Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
Uh... try 'password'.
You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
Don't, don't.
Hmmm.
[clears throat] [with a lot less enthusiasm] I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened. [clears throat] This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the 'Don't Go in There After Me' award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...
No, you shut up.
Wow. Really terrific.
Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Who's a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
Did you explain why?
That was a really sucky thing to do.
Oh! [to the theme of 'Jaws'] Dun-der. Dun-der...
Oh, that's not appropriate.
Argh, why are you all...
Well I have interviews.
I don't have to tell you anything.
Live and let live.
She did it!
Well, now suddenly he can see. [laughs] Okay, take off. See ya. Bye-bye. [gives coffee to Katy] There you go steaming hot cup of joe.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?
Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
Na?
[to everyone] Well here we are... I would just like to...
Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.
I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
Okay.
You love it. There ya go.
Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I don't care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.
I know.
I am going to throw you this ball.  When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.
[still talking like a robot] I... was just learning... to... love.
Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings]
Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.
Okay, okay.  I'll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley.  All right.
[as the power and lights come back on] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
You wearing a thong?
Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Hey, Jim. You got a hat?
Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can't do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.
No. Now, remember that honesty...
Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
Oh, hey. Thanks.
Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
Nah, I'm almost done.
How long till we get to Mexico?
Dwight?
Pro.
You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
Morning.
Well, it goes, it goes in the best direction, and that was not the best direction.
[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!
It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.
What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Michael Scott.
And it's all inclusive.
Parkoooooour!
You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
Foul! Foul!
Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.
Yup.
[sobbing] I'm sorry I called you faggie.  You're not faggie.  You're a a good guy.
No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
Thanks.
Ok, let me ask you this.
So many things.  I don't know.  It's hard to choose.
Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We'll, see you when you get out.
Who else here is single?
[back to the basketball game] Dwight, pass it to Jim! Pass it to Ryan!
Nope, you cannot use it.
Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity.
[singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us...
But it was not a fair fight.
Just keep pushing...
Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.
I am in.
Good night. She's a good boss.
Hey Jan.
Insult.
Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
Yeah!
Have you ever heard of Doctor David Friendly?
No it is not.
It's none of your business.
[grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
Oh.
So, you will?
Thank you.
Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
Do you want to talk about it anymore?
Ohhhh.  Arrrgggh!
I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]
Here.
Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
I don't want her to get away.
Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.
No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who's actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
That makes sense because he has elfish features.
I like his hair.
Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
How about never hundred hours, sir.
[makes squeaking sounds]
Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
Uh-huh.
Acrimonious.
Ok.
Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.
How about a location?
Well...
I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
You did!
Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?
Oh, so that's what they are saying?
Who quits?
Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
Ryan told me to always tell women you work in finance.
That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
Here we are.
Keep it. My gift. [hugs Chili's Manager] Thank you. Have a good night. See you next year.
I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
Really?
You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay. [they kiss goodbye.] Goodbye.
Shut -
Shake it, shake it!
Yes.
Oh, yuck. [spits out food]
Italians don't wear pockets.
[meeting Ed Truck in parking lot] Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin' back.
That's the whole point, dummy.
I don't know. I think so.
Don't...
OK, Hey, man, how's it going?
Mom, I'm getting married.
Good. Good, good, good. That's good. Now see, that's not so hard, right? All right. Who's next? Who are we going to... Ryan. Ryan's next.
Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
What?
You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
[laughing] Ohh, I miss you.
Ry-an.  You're here.  Whatcha got, whatcha got?  Alright, Panic Room, Maverick, Nell, Sommersby, The Accused.  Where's Little Man Tate?
Wow, really?
Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
It is Christmas.
You're the best.
This is it, check that out, can you smell that? [the room is filled with candles that say 'Serenity by Jan']
Was it nice?
Hey, Buttercup.
No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.
I think I'm going to make myself some microwave popcorn. [humming] Press 'Popcorn.' Oh, that's gonna be delicious. I just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon. You know what? I could do with some hot chocolate as well. Oh, drat. I can't make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time, unless, I can. Boom! Second microwave for le hot chocolat.
I'm not gonna lock my door.  [door closes. Then clicks locked]
What are you?
[through the car window] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh]
Do I look like I am joking?
Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one.
I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?
And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts...
All right.
Thanks. Thanks so much. You think it was good?
Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.
Okay.
I thought I did. So...
Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
[on microphone] Andy had Erin.
Absolutely.
Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
You know what?  I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
Yes.
Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
Good night guys. [staff leaves the office]
Why me?
Get in here... everybody.
Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
I do.
[into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please?
Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off]
Say it.
That's very rude.
Is he alright?
I am already walking.
Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. [opens phone] And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
Uh huh. Yup. That last thing they did was great.
Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--
Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.
Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip.
Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.
That is a good point.
I need him gone.
I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
So do I sign?
We need to sell her an elevator pass.
[to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal.
Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
What? I told them busiest...idiots.
Stanley, I got you some ganja. I'm just kidding. It's coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.
Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.
Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!
No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
If the salad is on top, I send it back.
I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
All right.
Are we ready for the game?
Well that is all in the past.
Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.
Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
All right, we need something for Kevin.
You are out of order.
I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
What?
Really?
You are?
You're right. What do you mean though?
I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don't want to go by myself.
And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
And the neighbors blamed Jan.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
[crying] Oh, God.  Oh, God.
Wow, man. That -
Yeah she probably, yeah she would be.  You know what, okay, excuse me.  Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music.  This is wrong, this is wrong!  This is wrong!  I have a girlfriend.  And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay.  Shame on you.  Go back to work!
I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names.  If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
[to the camera] Can you get her? She's right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, 'Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.' Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, 'Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael.' [pretends to vomit and laughs]
Oh...
Well...
You don't get it.
Hey, if there's anything else I can do, just let me know.
For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.
No, No.
Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
No, I can do it.
How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.
Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. [to cameras] Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok.
Field Trip.
[clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...
Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.
Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.
Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something.
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.
That's not in tune. I don't know if you can...
That's it!
What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.
Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.
Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
Black tie optional.
I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.
No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball?
Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]
You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.
[knocking] Yeah.
Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.
And I've never gone hang-gliding.  And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.
Maybe neither.
We're not-
Right what?
No antigravity machine, huh?
Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it.
On the phone.
Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
What's going on? Anything here?
[cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK.
That's it!
Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!
Quiz me up.
You know this can't go on.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Not gonna happen.
No.
Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. 'Mental' is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it.
Thank you, Dwight.
Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.
Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!
You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.
Very easy to clean.
I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
All right, shhh.  Dwight, leave him alone.
Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...
On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
All right.
How dare you sir. You are gross.
Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?
Um. Okay, um.
How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.
It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
Hey!
I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
You know what it means.
Whassup!
I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
Yo soy Cancun.
Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...
We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
No need for consternation, everything is under control.
Hello, everyone.
Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
[Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food?
That's good. He's throwing it.
Okay. Spoiler... alert.
I think you're a nice guy too.
Yeah. Maybe next year.
I didn't say it, I declared it.
Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! [Spanks himself]
Yeah that's fine.
Hup! [throws cheese puff to Ryan who catches it in his mouth]
Do I?
Yes.
Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
Toby.
Okay.
I am not paying for that membership.
Me? Okay.
Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?  Where are you off to?
Canada.
It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.
Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
Who.
Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
You know what. I think most basketball movies are great movies. Because it's a great subject. There's one about a little kid who, um, joins a professional basketball team and he's really, really good and he can dunk and he's like 3 feet tall. And he can dunk the ball. That, oh, I love that movie. That movie kind of, that movie makes me cry. I don't like to cry on camera, but that movie makes me cry. Um, because it touches a cord in me about hoops. [Michael's free throw is really short] Short, short, short! And basketball is like jazz, you know. To like pertipify it there's a jazz musician, a guy, you know... if you know jazz you know who I mean. He's uh, God what was his name? Um, he plays one of those curly horns, like those really shiny curly horns that's used in jazz a lot.
I want you to rub butter on my foot.
Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
[hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]
He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?
Wow!
Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.
No, for one thing, he's not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.
I have work to do.
[putting his feet on desk] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen.
I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
Just do a cartwheel!
Hi. What is the name of our town?
Umm, hmmm.
Nothing.
Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!
No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.
I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?
I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am...
The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
[playing Jan's message] 'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?
Yeah.
No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.
There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.
No no no no no no no. [accent] I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.
I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.
Who's that? Who's that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures]
Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
[listening to 'Crash Into Me' on his computer] Hmm... Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P...
Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak.
No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---
If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!
All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
[on sidewalk] There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! [all groan]
Uh, nine.
That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
She is a beaut!
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh]
What's happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.
Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.
Yeah, that got a little out of control. Jan's taking a break, which is fine. I'm doing the same, just chilling. Getting my mind off of us. She's right. I need to be more professional at the office. When I'm at work, I need to focus on work. I should call her ex-husband.
Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.  [singing]  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin' on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I can't explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on.  Tender love is blind---
I am well, sir, how are you?
I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
Yes.
Great.
Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. [snaps]
That would never happen.
Ghosts. Lots of ghosts in this old Radisson. There it is, Rosebud Room. Memories. Wow, this turnout is pathetic. I packed the house, you know.
Thank you.
[holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable.
How did this happen, how did I get this?
[overhearing Dwight's conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.
Tonight's so...
[seated] Ok. Ok. How 'bout this? [rises, waves, sits back down]
Ji.. why not? C'mon.
Wow! That's a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
Give me...  Give me the diary.
Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?
God! He's a comedian.
It's like a time bomb...
No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.
Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
The old one two. Let's do it.
This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
How pleasant. You can...
There is stink in there, my God!  What is... what is that?
Alright, you drive.
[clapping] Beautiful. Very good, nice.
Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.
No.  Yes.
I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.
Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out]
Hold on a second, Cynthia.
[low] Damn it.
Ohhhhh...
Whatcha got?
Nope.
You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
Please.
Let's cut it. [Dwight turns the music off]
What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
[someone knocks] Just pretend we're not here.
If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?
Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
Is that all you have on her?
Yeah.
How?
Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  I'd really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?
Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.
Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
Do you?
Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans]
Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.
Yep. Oh... wow.
I am not a mind reader, David.
[choking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music.
Right. [sighs]
On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.
Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]
I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
Well, he, Michael Scarn, that character, orders people around, and that's, you should of just gone-
I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
Is there something that you would like to say to me?
Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. [holding up photo of him and Wallace] You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
The aye's have it.
No, no no.
350 and one penny.
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...
Oh my God! That's it! That's it!
[entering break room, to Maurie] You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
Just drive faster. I want to get back.
Guilty.
No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. [sighs heavily] Okay... okay.
Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
Run what?
Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
I don't want Dwight!
[singing] OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then [jumbling up the words] can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. [more jumbled words] 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
Lay them on me. What?
Would you have sex with Meredith?
Let's get back to the matter at hand.
Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
Take heed of.
We're not doing anything.
[long exhale]
No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
I want you to bring a partner.
Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.
So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.
I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
Yeah, no, it's nobody.
Mm-do... Dwight would not-
Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That's strong!
Say hi to the kids.
[looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam?
Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
The same stuff you get downtown.
These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.
Wow.
Say it with an accent!
Stay-
Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
What?
Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]
[looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on.
I know, I know, we will wait.
No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
Not important.
This guy does it all.
So, like a freedom tree.
I... don't.
I can do that.
She would get this little foam mustache...
It's a big red trash compactor!
Is that what we're going for now?  'okay?'  We used to go for 'pretty good.'
[shakes head, annoyed] I don't know.
Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.
Are those all the other complains?
Okay! So...
And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Good news.
They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
Where is my cornbread?
Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
Sound good. Sounds fun.
Hello. [comes in carrying 4 gallons of orange juice and his water bottle] Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.
Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. [giggles]  It was hysterical.
[sighs]
Nice to have Oscar back.
Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?
When a man is laying on his deathbed there are four things that go through his mind. Was I well-loved? Check. Did I express myself? Did I let my light shine through? Check. Will an attractive woman cry at my funeral? Check. Probably more than one. Check. Check, check, check, check. Lastly, did I achieve success and own real estate? And when I close on this condo, I will be able to check that one as well.
Oh... It's ...
I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
Well, I'm texting him, so.
Oh, I still have more.
No... She's in a coma.
Excellent!
It's about you. It's about you. Go!
[imitating E.T.] Holly Flax.
Yes.
Beep! Bop!
Michael Scarn.
Did somebody order a hooker over here?
Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
Titanic?
Well, that's really not the way I roll, because sometimes I'm in the zone, and sometimes I'm in the zoning out.
[Riding a bicycle down the hallway and singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. [Struggling to stay on] 'Tis the ... ack. [expletive] Hey! [to Pam] I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
Burned my foot, Pam.
What did you just thought?
No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!
Well, okay...
You're not gonna lose them.
I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible.
No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
Seriously. No, really.
[in conference room] Here... [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]
That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
Or Ryan Stiles, something like that.
Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?
Night Erin.
[Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good.
I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible. [slams phone on desk, phone breaks]
Well?
Coat! [throws coat at Pam]
Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.
Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
What?
I don't have a second job.  Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
Mmhm.
Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.
And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
I'll kill you man!
Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
Yeah.
[under his breath] Oh, Christ.
Almost quittin' time.
I mean, they're just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth.
I think I know what's going on.  Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now.  And there isn't.  But, um... don't tell him.  Don't tell him that.  I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.
[whispering to Meredith] Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
[clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This...
I know. Ugh, that is so annoying. [makes fart noise] Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I've forgotten about? Just, you know we  bumped into each and you said, 'Brr, brr.' And I went, 'Argh, Argh.' You know? Anything? [shakes her head 'no'] Well, if you think of something, let me know. 'Cause I like to know. 'Cause I'm going crazy.
That's a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.
Inventory's at the end of December.
Oh. Wow. 'Michael Scott Paper Company.' Okay. Very official. 'Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.'
We're watching it.
What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time]
No, it is not.
Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.
There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. [spinning in chair] He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
Do I know what?
It's been opened.
I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
Get in there!
It is.
I'M TRYING! GOD!
Okay! Excellent. Oh...
OK.
I'm good. Oh, my God.
[door opening] All right. Here you go, Princess. Just finished with part one.
Hold on, Holly's coming back here?
Thank you!  Thank you!
He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.
That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
Yeah, I don't even know why I said booze cruise. I don't even think there's booze on the boat.
How's it going?
Just sell it.
Do some research.  Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.
Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.
And the last guy says 'No, hairy body'.
Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
[to everyone, in conference room] Okay, I made it all up.
Well you don't need two of you to do that.
Shut up, shut up.  Hello?
What a weird day.  I don't understand it, but you don't get to understand everyday of your life.  Maybe five, ten days a year, I'll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened.  Guess everybody has days like that.  Sometimes they're the nicest ones.  Still, I think there might be something wrong with Jan.
What do you think?  What do you think of this place?
[as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great. [walks into office]
She is pregnant. She is knocked up. 'K' Karen. Pam, let's go.
[smiling] Okay, well we'll work on it.
Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
What are you doing?
My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
Whoa!
You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
Come on, no, no, no.
I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!
Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
Well, it's a pretty big check.
Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
Yeah, can I point something out to you?
What?
What a tool. [Dwight and Andy exchange looks] What?
Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.
All right. That's looking good. Hey um, Ryan do you have any music I can borrow.
Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
Take a sip of that. [hands Andy his mimosa]
Do you want some coffee?
Aaaaaand, go!
What is up with you two, Holly?
I have been saying the word 'manager' a lot, so whenever Jo thinks 'manager' she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.
If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.
Per-diem. [singing as he signs] Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm! [shows off $100 bill to Ryan] You know, Ryan, it's all about the Benjamins.
If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That's how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.
Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.
You know me very well, Dwight.
I can't do the presentation, I can't- [voice cracks] ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! [starts crying, covers his face]
Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.
You're thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?
And the 'Tight Ass' award goes to Angela.  Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.  So...come on down.
No! No way! It... no.
Oh.  Hello!
That was the worst joke ever.
A horse.
No.
Irie.
Lowest in town.
[teen approaches table] Hello there.
Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five o'clock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home.
Jan.
Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying 'Dunder Mifflin' at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
No. We just talked. He's very nice.
Even as pie.
Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
So what?
Just don't let him sit on you...  I'm kidding.  You'll have fun.  It'll be good.  It'll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.
[ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out?  [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank]
No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'
[unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
Nobody likes beets.
Why'd you come back?  Why didn't you stay?
No, hey  it's just kinda uncool, okay? I, just... Play fair, you know, play fair.
No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.
I've been told that I'm a tactile learner.
And this is, don't tell me, Martin... Ne... Ne...Nack.
She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
Jerk. [walks off]
Okay, that might help. If you said 'I'm sorry' in front of everybody.
Good. Good. Thank God.
Same thing.
[laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!
Oh, that sounds awful.
Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted.
Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
Yes, that's me. Come on it.
China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.
Da  na na na na.
To be continued!
Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.
Jim is her husband.
Really?
Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
What's going on?
Istn't it?  Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic.  So you're from Des Moines?
I don't have a girlfriend.
She drives a green camry.
Don't!
What is it?
Really?
How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
Hey, hey, hey
Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.
No, neither am I. We both look good.
Damn it.
Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was--- that was a---
Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.
So, what do you do?
How about this one? It's Christmas eve---
I don't need a representative.
I'm writing one, yeah.
Radisson just gives out this vibe, 'Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson'.  It's kind of snooty.  So.
Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.
When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.
I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right?  I don't know.
So this is Astird.
Hello everyone!  As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding.  [Applause] So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.  And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one.  This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever.  It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.  So I am instituting prima nocta.
Waa... what? What are you talking about?
Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
[laughing] Oh, oh!
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...
I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.
That's right!  I am not thinking.
[In Horshack voice from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'] Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
Frame him?
Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.
Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath - looks at camera] Yeah, okay.
Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]
Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.
Sure you can't stay a little longer?
All right!
All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
Well, let's keep this party movin' on.
Okay.
Oh, God.
What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
I love you.
I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you. [Pam and Jim begin wheeling him] Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
You're trying to trick me.
You just said, let me uh... check my notes.  You just said...
Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
Ryan?
Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.
Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic]
I don't appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.
Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.
Excellent!
I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
Okay.
Oh God!
...kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
No, it said right, it said take a right.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office]
Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays.
Oh... That's gonna change. [laughing]
Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?
What?
He is I.
Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.
You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
Pam!
Stay [bleep] calm!
Uck... T.M.I.
Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]
God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
Oh my God...
Hi.
[laughing]
[everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.
You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.
Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
Hey.
Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
Why would I do that?
Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
I just don't want you to lie to me.  I don't want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?
I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...
Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...
We didn't get it.
Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  [Jim pushes speaker phone button]  Michael Scott here.
I can't get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.
Yeah.
Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out.
You've got it, you've got it.
Hey, nice to meet you.
You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.
[with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please.
I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.
What a disaster, this whole thing.
I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.
I'll just wave and introduce myself.
No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
[in Ryan's office, which is illuminated blue] She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
I'm the mistress?
All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.
Just sit down Kelly.
Mm hmm.
What?
And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.
So, what about you, Angela?  Do you have any single friends?
I love you, Jan.
Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws 'em off.
Have a seat.
Stop.
Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office]
Okay.
No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.
You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.
Okay.
Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
Yes, it is true.
I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.
How is that possible?
What up?
Pro-Am.
I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Yeah.
Yeah, more like a 1,000.
Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
Everybody, except Stanley.
Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Dwight, they called your name.
You're right.  It will blow over.  But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?
Oh! [rips open cardboard box] Wow. Awesome. [distributing items] For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.
OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at... [reading computer screen] Packer@DunderMifflin.com.
Kind of in the middle of something here.
There's no downsizing.
I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
No.
Ye - OK, yes.
Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for...
Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
David!
Well, this...
Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
Oh, wow. He...
[Jim makes a shot after pushing off Roy] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
What are you talking about?
Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!
Why did you just say he was the boss?
The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don't act fast, you will lose customers.
Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
Well, what should I do?
Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:
Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.
[in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
What'd you have, Stanley?
One. Two. Three.
Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.
Didn't move my lips.
Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.
[singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
Okay.
[English accent] Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']
Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?
I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me.
Ryan?
Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
Sandwich platters.
And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.
Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.
Why? Well, theft and stealing.
400 and one penny.
Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?
Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot!  And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now.
[Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who's Pat?
Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.
OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesn't even need to be good.  Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins.
[takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie]
Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
I have a special assignment for you.
I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.
I never said you could do that.
Sure.
What about her looks?
Ahhh... Ho ho ho! [struggles to pull Ryan towards him] Come on I need this. Come over here!
Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]
Everyone is going to end up dying someday.  And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with.
Mmm.
When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-
Okay.
Hey, okay.
Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
[on phone] No, no, no, I'll talk to her.  I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes.  Alright, by pickle.
I will miss you the most Ryan.
Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
Why did you do that?
I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]
No, Jim brings in money.
Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog?
Who else knows?
Hmm?
BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
No, there... Later there was.
You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.
[as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start.  Um...
Oh, no, no, no. No.  It's stupid.  You'd hate it.  I hate it.
Thank you.
Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]
Open your mouth.
Why is today a special day?
It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...
If it's me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, 'Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?'
Okay.
Well?
[reluctantly] Yeah ...
[chasing Meredith] Come on. Shh...
Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
Oh, man.
What? What? We did?
Darryl, would you do the honors?
So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  I'm on it, don't worry.  So, how do I do that?
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
[breathless] All right.  Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee]
Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations.
Well, at least you're still being honest with me.
No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
[exhales] Well then... I am glad you're ok.
Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
[cleaing throat] You're a jerk. Dwight's a jerk!
I'm just going to put this over there.
Go buy some watermelons.
Anything's possible.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
[driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? 'Raging Bull.' Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. [Michael opens his blinds and looks at Ryan in the parking lot] There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. [Calls Ryan on the phone, Ryan doesn't pick up after seeing that Michael is calling] Oh, we're playing phone tag.
Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?
What is it?
You're welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.
Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
About what?
Right? [laughs]
Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
Ahhhh!  [sweeps toys off his desk]
Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.
It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.
No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
[watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.
What are you reading?
You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.
Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
Other than me.
Ok, what kinda machine is that?
Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?
Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...
[sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?
Exactly, were not...
Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
Alright.
It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin' tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
Ahoy, matey.
[normal voice] I'm not the godfather.
Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
Well, it has certain connotations.
Hi. How are you?
Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.
I don't think... I love it!
No.
No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around]
Yes.  Join me please, won't you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office]  I am going to give you a raise.
Disruptive.
What's up?
What, huh?
In training.
Let's send up Accounting.
Nice, Stanley!
Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
Well...
Yeah, why don't you do that?
I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
Guh.
Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.
Oh...
You call that a sales call? My God, what have they been teaching you?
What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?
[muttering] I'm not saying... a damn thing.
Seventeen.  I say seventeen squares.
Oh -hoh! All right.
[hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll kill you.
[lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.
Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  [Michael knocks on desk]  Come in.  [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]
So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]
Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.
What if she makes me?
So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss]
Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?
Give me the phone.
Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
Is Gould dead?  What uh-
Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
Just... try to be cool.
Oh, hey guys. [thumbs up]
Stanley's wife is out of town.
All right, see you at one.
Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.
Don't run.
It's done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]
You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so...
I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
What?
But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
Good.
How come you didn't get me one?
Uhh, I don't know.
Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society.
[sighs] Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
Uh-huh. [comes out of office] Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. [shakes Charles' hand] At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. [leads round of applause] Here he is.
Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
Okay.
What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]
Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.
Because, Dwight... never lies.
Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Yes.
Hey!
Great work tonight.
So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like...
Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
Times have changed, Jim.
Okay, I will start.  Um, 'A.' [singing] 'A' my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um...
160
Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
[eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that?
I used to be in HR.  I was a Hell raiser.
No! No No. No. 'My Stumps.' Like 'My Humps' but a guy with no legs.
Yeah.
Uh, nope.
I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive [Andy joins in] Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Yeah.
You're not.
OK.
Thank you for your honesty.
Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
I want you to get your ass out of my face.
It's totally impossible!
Got it. It works.
[Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here.
Just don't, don't talk-
Then I'll give you away!
Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.
Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Snowboarding?
Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
You're welcome.
Good!
It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.
But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
Attention, all problem sales persons. Jim Halpert... Dwight Schrute...
No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
Why don't you go with him?
Let's do that.
We should come up with a signal of some sort.
Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.
Worse than that.
OK
While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?
Ah, just the stupid leads.
To change lives.
Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?
Ah.
Okay, okay okay.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
[Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael's shoulders] Don't do that.
Or, 'Total Eclipse of the Fart.'
[Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
No. We are not done here. This-
You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.
You have stress?
I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man.
Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.
Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. [cuts to Jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of Ravioli] A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [clue next to Jim reads: 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing [cut to scenes of chaos as everyone argues] Some people shouldn't be in this business.
Dunder-Mifflin.  It's okay.  [he throws the keys into bushes across the street]  I just did.
There's no way I'm gonna do that.
So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?
That's what she said.
OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?
Okay... what?
N-
Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
No.
Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.
Stop it! [smacks Dwight's arm]
Hello.
No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!
Yes, it is.
[sighs] Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.
All right. You have to pick up after them.
Strike while the iron's hot. A joke always works.
He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
That's right, let's do this.
But then she goes on to say 'that will be our only topic of discussion'.  That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.
Hello.
I'm between specialists right now.
OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
[to camera] Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game.
Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]
Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
Huh?  He might do it...
I don't know if I wanna do this.
700
Yeah.
It's alright. I can handle it.
Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.
Uh-huh.
Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
[entering break room] Who's getting married?
Thank you.
Very comedically humorous Jim.
[gesturing Pam to be quiet] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.
I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
[walking into the office] Good morning Erin.
Would you stop it, please?
You're welcome.
Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting.
Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
I'm a little busy right now.  Could you BlackBerry me a message?
Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
How's the lady situation?
Okay.
Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.
I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.
[laughs, looks to camera excitedly]
I'm creative, Ryan.
Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
Okay. I'll see you in a bit. [whispering] She's pretty cute isn't she? See you in a bit.
Drugs?
I will allow it.
Oh the Anti-Christ!
Okay, all right.
Oh, I know your hero. Yeah, saving you from Animal Planet Jack over there. [laughs]
We should really start recycling.
Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
Are you kidding me? Stop it.
No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
No, no. I celebrate privately.
[obviously faking being serious the whole time] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
I wasn't.
It could've died of natural causes. So...
Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
Yeah, baby!
All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad.
Here we go, fourth time's a charm. 'Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying?
No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay? [exhales]
[off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.
Hmm..
Yeah, it's a business lunch.
You knew about this all along, didn't you?
No, no.
Does David know this?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
Thank you! [Pam hands him blank paper] What, what is this?
What?!
Yes.
Oh, really?
What is this meeting about?
Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.
[stares at Diane, eyes tearing up]
I know.  I love Counting Crows.
Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.
Oh, come on. Come on.
Over our love.
Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
Hey.
What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.
I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
Woo!  Shotgun!
Michael Scott Paper Company only.
Mmhmm.
Well, it's not official.
500
Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
Birdie. He's not the guy with the cheeks. Kenny G. Is... if you knew jazz, you'd know who I mean. Kenny G. God. Glad I remembered that. Jazz people know who he is.
Yes.
And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.
Good, that is what's most important.
Well, okay, lets go.
You don't want me to help?
What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!
Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout.
Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman's pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
All right! Cool!
God.
Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
Good, so, we're on the same page?
Mhhmm! We would be married.
Yes you will.
Uh... Ten year.
Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified.
How we doing on time?
Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.
I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
I know.
Meeting confirmed.  Would you like your confirmation number?  Please grab a pen, because I will only be repeating this once.
And that Angela's a midget, and that [indicates Jim] your chin is too big.
Smells good.
What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
We can do...
Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.
What is the world's largest ocean?
No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
No, no, no.  I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
Sure. You like Cosmos?
Yeah.
No you're not.
You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.
For?
I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe]
[all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
Well, please?  I won't tell anybody.
Well they notice it.  Don't you?  You notice it.  It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?
No!
It's illegal. Can't do that.  Next best thing.
Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You're  lucky you're so darn cute.
Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?
Is there no way we can get rid of him?
Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.
Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I'm a big believer in people being here more.
No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
Oh.
Maybe I did. Maybe I  called him, I don't know.
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
Alright, in my defense...
I can't stop myself from kissing her.
There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
Just crunch 'em.  Just crunch 'em please.
I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
I was in love with you.
I had rebound? Yeah.
It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?
And fries!
Yes.
Stop it.
An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
[banging on the glass] Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don't talk to them.
What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.
Yeah?
[Kelly singing] Hey! Hey! Stop your mouth, please.
All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
Yeah I'm good.
The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
What the hell is going on?
I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!
You can't always work 200 days though.
Well, comedy's kinda my thing. Watch this, here's Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Right. [Continues with cod German] Me, me, me, me, me, me. Curly Joe Hitler. [laughs]
Mmhmm.
[in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.
Wanna come over Friday?
So close. So close.
All of us?
Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh...
Who's Amanda Bynes?
I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
Oh, okay.
Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.
Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight...
William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I'm paraphrasing here, 'Love doth be poison.' Brilliant. And a lot of people don't give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes.
Nobody thanked me.
Are we ready?
Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.
...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
You first.
Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.
So Bernie's, huh?  We're all going to Bernie's? [to camera]  Go to Bernie's?
It's the only time he can do it.  2:30 to 3:15.  It's going to be great.  We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.
How did you know?
You know who that is?
Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly's Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]
Yehhhehh.
Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.
Oh, thank you.
That's a shawl.
OK?
Am I the princess?
That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
Okay. How's yoga?
Help me out here.
Thank you.
Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
Let's just push on, shall we?
Exactly. What are you thinking?
Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I'd like you to smile. I'd like to see a big smile.
Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
Goodnight!
I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. [to band] Do you know, um, 'Goodbye Stranger'? Supertramp?
Take heed of.
Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
You're not going to.  You know where you're going?
Shut up!
We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I've never been a fan.
What?
You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.
Save yourself!
That was Packer!  Oh, you're... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you.
[as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um...
Yes.  My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation.  Very, very excited.  He is my protege.  He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured.  Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk.  And now he is also my boss.  So, win/win.
I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?
Ok guys, you know what?  I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?
The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
No, I'm whipping them.
Shh...
Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
I gave it to you in the car.
Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.
Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
Oh, John Belushi. What a crazy guy. Phew, freaked myself out this morning.
KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face]
All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.
Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
Push free play til tomorrow morning. [to Grotti] Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.
I humbly accept the management position.
That's what I'm talking about!
Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Men's Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  I'd like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make 'em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  'Hello, I'm Michael.  Welcome to Men's Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today.' ... This is one example.
Oh, wow.
Is the cool new guy Charles?
I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.
Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.
Yes.
Well.
But you just said 15.
This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.
OK. [walks away]
Pop quiz.
That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?
In terms of land, not population.
I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
Wow!
Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
Can you send Dwight in here?
And I used to say 'Hey, got latte?' And she'd say, that's not funny.
Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?
I owe you an apology.
Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
Alright.
Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...
Ok, see what I did?
Um, wanted: middle aged black man with sass.  Big butt, bigger heart. [knock on the door] I can't do this.
Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you're obviously single.
Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let's have happy times.
I love Pad Thai.
OK, 1 Sikh, and...
I got you... jade earrings.
Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
Wait a minute.
Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
No, You're not going to collect them.
OK, I'll take it. [misses free throw] OK.
Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.
Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
Oh, have you not?
[sigh] I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
Dwight does not play a robot.
[ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
Not a native speaker.
[rapping] I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
Oscar, what were you going to say?
NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
Well, okay...
[to Maurie, the Asian intern] Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said 'The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.'
[at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?
Thank you, Dana.
God, does anybody read the paper?!
No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.
They call it Scranton!
Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
[while in his reeking office]  I am a big Fear Factor fan.  I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um... [clearing throat]   I can't stand it [gets up to leave], I can't stay in here another second.  No!
Yes.
Ahh... [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face]
The pressures of my office are insane.
Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting!
Sounds awesome.
Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers.
Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.'
Uh huh.
Now hit me. [DeAngelo slaps him] One, two, three.
[on his cell phone] Hey, hey Craigers, my man! It is Michael Scott here. [silence] Dunder Mifflin, we supply your office paper.
You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.
Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud]
DEAD.
So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
Yeah, oh, hey.  Did he call?
Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it's time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?
Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.
Kev...  Nice.  Going.
I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.
...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
Yes.
Let's go, come on. [whispers] God!
Why don't we just, live and let live?
Perfect. [starts closing the door]
I changed it.  To Chili's.
She already has a stroller.
Nine days, though. That's, like...
Really?
Yes.
I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.
It is a colonoscopy.
I think it does.
No Michael here, my name is-
I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. [covers Meredith's face with his jacket] You are now sexy in your culture.
You did?
Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
That's adorable.
Oh. You waiting for a call?
Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...
When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...
So what was rule two?
I don't... remember.
Ok, alright I gotta go.
[laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... 'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
I will do all the talking.
Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time.  It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be torture for you.
I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.
Whass...up!
[singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...
Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five's Stanley]. That's right.
Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
During our relaxation exercise?
No, no, really not necessary.
This is all mine. All the way down around the corner. It's a shared space, but I can use it whenever I want to,
[on the bus] Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
[on [phone] No, I don't think I'm asking too much. I think it's only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that... yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did
I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.
Not now, not ever.
You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
Hey, Toby.
You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].
[still brushing teeth] Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.
That's called card stock.  That's what you're feeling.  Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, 'Am I good enough for this job?  Do I have what it takes?'  And I think we both know the answer.  We'll find that out together.  You can keep that.
Hold on, hold on! Just-
Yes. Right. Good.
[talking over Toby and Katy] Toby's divorced. God, that's hard. That really ripped you up. She got the kids right? That'll damage ya. Sorry man. That's uh, that's a bad one. How much you paying her? What can, you can't even afford anything now, right? You're all right though, right? Don't ask me for a raise. [laughs] Cup of Soup's a good idea though. That'll... that's a good budgetary thing to do.
Best night ever.
Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.
Uh-huh.
Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
Okay! Alright, okay.
Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
Buenos dias, Erin.
Hey!
I don't, I don't have to have that.
Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.
Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.
[laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!
Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.
No, you said something, didn't you?
Yeah?
Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!
I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.
You've got it.
No, no. I know you didn't intend to, but I just I got the idea and I, uh, I just don't it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something. You know? And then prey on their emotions.
And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
We will wait for the call and you will smile.  Let me try something, just while we're waiting.
Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?
Oh! I don't know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.
Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.
I was in that marriage arena, though.
Everybody enjoying their meal?
Yes.
Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
I... won't.   I won't.
Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.
Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.
Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!
They act like I have no power.
Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?
Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients.
Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea-[cell phone rings] Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?
Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?
Excited to talk ideas.
What about our truce?
Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one: 'What should we do to prepare for Y2K?'
Really? Wow.  That's over $200 a year.
Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
I know what you want to ask me. 'Did your mom ever see you naked?'
Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys.
[sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]
Questions?
Okay.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
Conflict!
Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...
There is no such things as monsters.
Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...
No, we know. Texas!
Thank you.
Bluh.
Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.
[laughing] No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?
[mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office]
Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
Okay.
Maybe.
OK...  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
Yup.
What do you mean, 'what'?
Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all.
Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being 'lured' these days. Thank you Dateline!
Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
No, the country.
That sounds like it was hilarious.
Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
I know, I know.
I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!
European offices are naked all the time.
I started a fire, I started a fire.
No!
To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
OK, good.
I dare you to.  Come on.
So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't.
Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.
Mmm-hmm.
We did it!
He will be ushering you out.  [starts laughing]
[puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
I have listened to that song so many times and I still don't know what OPP stands for. Other people's... Something. I... [shakes head]
Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.
My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs]
MmMmm.  All I need...
Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. [camera pans to different people in the office] Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So... [phone rings, computer chimes, etc.] That's Uh...
I can't even say it. H-I...
This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
Ohh, lunch party.
Okay, okay. Um...
Could I be a part of the meeting also?
Yeah.
You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
Yeah.
[Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
[breathing heavy over intercom, starts laughing]
Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
He's a good mechanic.
That was fun.
Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.
What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We're like Animal House.
Damn it. Come on.
[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]
We're all going bowling!
Yeah!
No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]
Pam... PAAAM!?
OK. All right. See you later.
Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob]  You guys are going so slow...
Evan, this is Jim.
Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
Whatever David wants.
What about a rabies nurse?
Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
I do.
Today I'm headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention. [makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream] Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.
Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
I do too.
Sorry.
I don't know, I don't know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression---
What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside.  Don't... please...
No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.
Excuse me. Yes?
I think I know where he is.
I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
How's this place treating you?
No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
That is a very, very funny story.
Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid.
Well...
I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry.
A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house.  Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few.  Very soothing.  [to the interviewer] Want to try?
He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Da  na na na na.
[amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?
[sighs] How can he still not know?
[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
Mmm... nah, that's too young.
I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
Yeah, well, did I teach you to roll over like a submissive dog?
Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...
Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
I don't believe you.
Yes, indeed.
All right, yes.
Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
[cheers loudly after cast finishes singing song] That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
Really?
Well, don't do that. Where are your glasses?
Let me getcha.
See you later. [hugs Wallace]
Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot...
Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?
[in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!
And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.
The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
I call shuffle.  Here we go.  [Spreads cards out all over the table]
Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... [Jim draws a triangle around Michael's diagram] ... I have to go make a call.
You're...you know what?  I read in one of those books that you're not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.
Okay, I think we're good.
Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.
Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?
[Grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat] Oh, great.
She's not playing the game.
That's a good deal.
Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, 'I have cancer.'
Awesome!
The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
Um, you're in accounting...
I just saw this baby daddy-
Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
Come on, egghead. Let's do it.
I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
Bye.
No, no. You're done.
Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.
Set!
I'm gonna walk away.
I can't take it anymore.
That could not possibly be it.
You're... You're welcome.
Yes, I am.
Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Booty call.
I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it!
Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
Like the witness protection program.
I'm taking one for my lady friend.
No.
Stop the bus, okay?
She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.
That's sorta secondary. [offers Jim the watch again]
Why?
Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'
[in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
Do you have everything, guys?
I think you're great.  You're my best friend.
Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. [turns around to find Toby standing behind him]
Do you like TCBY?
Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval]
Well, then, Gould wasn't kidding.
To throw you off the scent.
Ok, I'll stand near you.
Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!
No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.
Yeah?
Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.
Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
Is this the tape of me falling?
That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.
We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
That's what faggie means!
[Dwight is wearing a bra] You just twist your hand until something breaks.
If I could change the life of one person, just one person. I... Actually, that's shooting kind of low. I already did that when I was born. I changed two people's lives. Mom and Dad. Um, if I could change the lives of 5,000 people... 10,000. No, five. I'd be satisfied with 5,000. I... 10,000 though, that'd be something. Wow, 10,000 people. Because, you know what? Even one is amazing.
No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.
No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
I got his pants.
No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.
I know, I know.
OK.
Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
Oh please.
Hey, do you need any help?
[Phyllis scores] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score?
Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...
No. This is delightful, charming culture.
[from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell.
[on phone] What's it... why are you crying?
You heard me, pack your things.
T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say 'Don't go there' but that's... lame.
Sure!
What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
Could you send her in?
[during curtain call for Sweeney Todd] Boo! Boo!
Bob, how old are you?
...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
[knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah?
It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
Oh, yeah.
Stop.
Ah, why, that's great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
Give me the phone.
That does sound fun to me.
No, I don't.
Right, right, right.  Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party.  A big office party I need to go to, so...  Can't get out of it.
Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.
It's seems like ya did though-
Okay. You can count on me.
When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute. [Phyllis looks relieved] And she still is.
Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.
Yeah, I have fun.
Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We're going now!
That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
This is so stupid.
Have a seat. Like everybody else.
[on phone] Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
[grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay.
...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.
Yes?
Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
No. I'm sure.
Oh, ok, that's, great.  No, I can't drive.  Jim why don't you drive.
Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell]
So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
Well...
They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.
Okay, bye bye.
Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby.
I'm not following you.
Come on, let's go back to the party.
You're weird.
Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.
Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
You can go to hell. [laughs] I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? [classical piano playing] [violin playing]
I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!
Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?
Bye.
Hey Dwight, he found it.
Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually. [pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them]  There you go.  Use it in good health.
Go! Oh, that's nice.
Nine dollars. The boys' department.
Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
An Indian Halloween. Okay, great. [to phone] Pam, could you put Jan on, please?
Okay.
Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I... you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done . [no one comes forward]  Very well.  Then you are all punished.
Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.
Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.
I'm joking.
Mmmhmm.
Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
[Knock at the door] Yeah.
Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
Let me see your teeth.  Let me see 'em.  Let me see 'em.
I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
Yeah, tell me about it.
We are great together. We are a great team.
Did she say what it's about?
Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
But it is already three o'clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Oh, wow!  Whoa!
I don't get it. Do I stress you out?
...would I go near---
Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!
Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
All right, attention everyone.
And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf]
Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
Good. Okay.
Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin' for lunch?
Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates]
Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!
No.
Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - [Jan leans over and kisses Michael passionately]
We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.
You wanna be Santa?
No.  I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
You don't know that.
Are we going?  [Dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown] Don't do that. Just say action when we're ready.
Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'
Uh, just a few more items.
Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
I lied to myself too.  I'm not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don't know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.
I don't need a gun.
[shouting] Toby, just do it! God!
Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
Here's a question for you. I have a convertible. Is it safe that park that in my driveway. [Man steps back inside his house and shuts the front door] All right. See you soon. Good guy. Um, cool.
Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
Then I will name your team the Red team.
...Jan. Kay.
That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam's chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don't have copiers. They don't even- [struggles to get up from Pam's chair] Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
I don't think there's any stronger choice than being a really strong character.
You know what this is? This is a stinger.
Here
Stop talking all at once!
Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]
I am going to give Toby...
Oh, well, then, email it to me.
Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about?  You're... you're worried about the cop's time?  You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
Okay, okay, what's better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
No, I mean this apartment building, it's fantastic.
Uh, okay.
Oh, um, potato salad.
I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
A couple of years ago, I went to one in Hartford. 'Connecticut.' And Todd Packer and I went to this bar and met a girl. And [laugh] Packer decides to make out with her. Turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar. [laugh] I love this. The bouncer chases us out to Packer's Vette, jump in the Vette, he
[next house] Congratulations!
Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. [hangs pictures of fat people on the wall, including two fat people on a bike, the Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man, Elvis, Martin Lawrence in Big Mamma's House, Jabba the Hutt, and a fat pig] They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.
It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.
Mmm-hmm.
Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
Okay.
Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
Help. Me.
Wait. You forgetting something?
Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.
Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh?
Ok, be more specific.
Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.
Do you think I'll get any new ones?  I could... [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight]
All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
Yes, yes. What yes? A sale or a lead or...
I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this.
Never...
[still trying the backwards basket] Catch you guys- [forklift drives in front of the camera] Catch you guys on the filippity flip. [misses and picks it up again] Flippity flip! [misses again and grabs it back] Flippity flip! [makes it in, gets excited] Really? [composes himself] Okay, see ya guys! [walks away, containing his self-pleasure]
It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
You too, have a good night.
Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag.
No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.
I'm not saying that's what he said.
I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.
Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
Oh do not raise your voice to me!
Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it]
No no no, no, new suit, please.
Confidence, Dwight.
What?
Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton... Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one.
Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.
Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer]
No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.
[in reference to the team shirts] I'll take a shirt.
Hey. How's everybody doing?
How ya doin'?
Yeah.
Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You'll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles... Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don't laugh; please don't laugh this time Dwight. You're... it's, it's bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one.
No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now.
Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.
Yes.
Aaaaaaaa!  It's coming!  Here we go! [drops the watermelon onto the floor] Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-
I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.
Hey hey, fellers.
OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
Oh, anything bad?
[phone rings] Yes
That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.
Well get on it.  And make it happen.
[Michael storms into office] Wow.
Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.'  It's code.  She'll know what it means.
I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  [throws money at Phyllis] There you go.  There's some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.
You're back. What happened?
But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
Hi, Mema. It's Michael.
That is worse.
Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
Is it Stanley?
[Dwight and Stanley are in sumo suits] Ready! Go!
I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
I don't have a room?
Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.
That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
Like you're applying for a loan.
No. I said I hate the, the style.
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.
Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
Yeah, I do. My word against yours.
Mm, nope. Don't like that.
Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.
Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to 'Y'.
Do I have any messages?
OK.
What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
[on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...
Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?
Do you know a joke?
No.
Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]
My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
No.
Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.
No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.
Really?
Just go out, and come back in.
You're better. You're better than my best.
Make the party.  Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis. [Phyllis starts inflating a balloon with a pump] Pump it!
What?
[as Mikanos] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you. [exits conference room] [normal voice] All, you have to close right now.
[sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.
Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?
You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
OK, yup.
What punch?
No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? [Andy laughs] My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
That's a pun.
I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.
Beat it!
Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
No, you don't have to do that.
And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.
Pam's mom.
First got priorities.
Are you sure?
What?
Well, we'll squeeze you in.
It didn't come up organically.
I want to see it.
I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
Are we both at the right place?
It is a terrible year for love.
[stands up and walks away]  I already have my European girlfriend.
David?
Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
Why, is there an untapped gay market?
No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.
[whispering to Pam] They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
No.
Good to see you. [they hug] AJ.
This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?
You're right. That's good.
Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?
[generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations.
Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter]
Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
Are you mental?
Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. [claps]
It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down]
Ugh, forget it.  I'll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!
[opening blinds as Stanley walks past] Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?
Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just... yeah.
Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management. [takes deep breath] Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today... And you don't worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... And there are no roofs in coal mines.
Because that's all it takes.
Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
[starts dancing with Phyllis] Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.
I mean, you just come in and you're just negative...
[laughing] Right!  [serious] And I take that as a compliment.
Morning, Pam.  Hey.
Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.
Andy Bernard.
All right.
I am not going to tell you anything.
Stanley, you don't need to answer that.
I don't romanticize th- [Dwight nodding and mouthing 'Yes you do'] No...
Threat neutralized.
[in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.
Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
You will find love.
All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.
They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
What?
Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...
Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like... [singing] Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah...
Well...
We have to put an end to this.
Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
Well, you're wearing it at the office. And [smells Jan] it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.
OK.
I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
Ok, alright.
...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
Hello, Rolando, how are you?
Home, sweet home.
I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.
OK, use your imaginations.
Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
Beard.
[reading the performance review] 'I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs.'
Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?
Okay.  All right, Dwight.  Take my money.  Go ahead.  Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.  The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.  Just ring me up.  Go ahead [Dwight tears up bill].
Yes.
Okay, go, go, go, go!
Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.
Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.
You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied. [puts lei on Angela]
No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
About talking to the press?
Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.
It's European, OK?  It's a European cut.
Close them.
I-
[on the phone] Okay, that quantity of cotton fiber will cost you... my screen disappeared. I know. I will click on the bottom and... Yes. I'm getting one of those little hourglass things. Used to have a price chart on the wall, now it's a little hourglass thing with an arrow next to it. Now it's just an hourglass thing. Uh-huh, yeah, well, or I can call you back. Okay.
Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.
Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
That's a drive!
There you go! Where's the other?
Yeah.
No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
That's hilarious.  What's her number?
There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
Are you kidding me?
I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
Yes.
Exactly that.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
[folding his pants on top of the ice machine, man walks in with ice bucket] Why don't you take a picture.  It'll last longer.  God.  Can't I get a little privacy?
Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.
Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it
No!
Alright.
[Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad.
Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?
Okay.
Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
Michael Scott.
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
I did it! [exhales]
Very inspirational. [laughter]
Is that why your wearing makeup today?
I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an...' Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.
Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.
No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.
I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight?
[looking at gay porn] Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, it's all goooooood!  I don't particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually... it is quite beautiful.
Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]
Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--
Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...
No!  No-- no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
What do I write under 'reason for visit'?
Thank you.  Pam, messages please?
I am a grown-up, Jim.
Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn't actually have cerebral palsy. Okay.
I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
Okay.
Why do you have a diary?
Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
Yeah! [office erupts in cheers and applause and hugs] It's a Christmas miracle!
No. These s'mores are disgusting.
I don't think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.
I got gum in my hair.
Midnight, Oscar!
Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.
When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, 'Michael, I love you, but I can't do this.' But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh?
Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.
[mumbles jibberish]
Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
Are we over budget?
God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.
I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.
Oh, that is gross.
No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?
Is it?
---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
Woo!
All right.
Alright. Hi. Any messages?
It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.
Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]
Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
[to camera] Could you...?
Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
What?
Alright.  I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.
Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?
One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.
I'm texting about you, okay!?
I'll call her later.
Don't...' Okay, that's blank. Don't. Just...
Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.
We got beat today, Dwight.
Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...
Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
Cool. For who?
Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.
Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese.
[to Stanley, who is cracking up again] You were laughing right?
Really?  I don't know.  It's a big third date, Jim.
Or a trained seal. [laughter]
No, no, no, no. I have the long sleeve. And actually, you know what we should do? We should wear them tomorrow to work, it'll be hysterical.
Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.
[on the phone] What can we do to help you out? You know what? I have a discount. Today and today only, on lightweight copier paper.
The best.
Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
I know you are. Knock, knock.
Hey--
Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
I'm awful, aren't I?
[walks into park with Dwight] Hi stranger! Long time!
Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.
Rock and roll. [they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone]
That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.
Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
I want it to be like... 'Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?' 'Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous.' 'Well, guess what, [whispering] that was Michael Scott.'  'But it was anonymous, how do you know?' 'Because I'm him.'
They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]
Oh my God, something's happening.
Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
On purpose?
No. The monkey!
Hmm?
What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.
Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.
Funk is the problem and the solution.
Yeah, it's routine.  I'm just a little bit scared.
And dental this time.
Tell me if I'm smiling or not. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling?
Why quick?
Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... [Erin shaves Michael] god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
Count the last one.
She was so innocent.
Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee]
You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
Hello, traitor.
What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
Um... literally two seconds?
I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
You should... floss.
[trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.
Hey, Dwight.
Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?
That's a lot of zeroes.
Hey.
Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck.  'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.  I think it's because they respect me.  A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone.  That's respect.
Yes, under my tutelage.
Really?
What?
I'm...
No.
Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]
Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
Yep.
[in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
That's how devoted I am to this job.
Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.
Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
Alright.
Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.
No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.
Hey Mer. How ya doing?
Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.
[deeper] Da  na na na na.
Jim? Are you?
Yeah.
No, no, Toby. No.
Yeah?
[groans in frustration] You think it's easy?
Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.
Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There's a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.
Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?
We're all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I'm doing this for you.
What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
And that is probably why most ads suck. [points to the ad men waiting outside the conference room] Oh, that's them!  Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film. [everyone starts leaving the conference room] [loud whisper] Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?
You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
A week? A month? A year?
Oh...
No. What do you mean?
I'm going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
[scats awkwardly] There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
[sighs] Fine.
Yeah, that's right. Fifteen years and three months. Wow, you were hired before I was. Must be thinking about retirement.
[ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
[looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here?
No, that wouldn't-
Why?
Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?
[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
I'm a smart guy.  I'll figure it out.
Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I'm just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.
Don't touch me this time.
What's the matter... haaaww!
Pam, it's Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
I did!
Oh, you idiot.
Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on ...
No, Dwight!
That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.
That will not go over well.
Speak.
I have to know whether you're serious or not.
Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here?
You people are revolting. By far, the least popular people here. I should have fired you. Who knew Devon was so popular and had so many friends. So well-loved.
Uh, yes. Thank you for noticing.
Yes.
...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
Uh, [in a nerdy voice] 'I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.'
Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.
No, please, please...
Ugh.
That's good.
Nothing.  I wrote 'bringing someone to the hospital'.
At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna win.
Yes.
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?
There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.
W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
WOO!  Alright!
Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup.
There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?
[walks up] Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.  How do I look?
I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
Of course.  Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.
Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
I was going to be a bottle capper.
[to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
Oh, honey, here's Stanley.
[places the gift basket on top of the table] Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
Um, yeah.  Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.
About what?
Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.
Yeah, the Commish.
After breakfast.
No, I've seen the video.
Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.
[on Jo's jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.
They were.
Yep.
Alright.
Well, I-
Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
Mm-mm.  Todd Packer.
She'll be sitting home saying, 'Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons.'  [Dwight laughs] 'And... and clip my toenails.'
And they had no yams?
Well, yeah.
Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! [all four of them sit in an empty booth with small Dunder Mifflin sign]  Hello!
Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.
There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.
That's not gonna happen.
It is six a.m. [DeAngelo yawns] and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
All right!
What?
Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.
Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.
No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]
That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.
Did you see Oprah yesterday?
Right.
[singing] Chili's baby back ribs...
[pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer.
What's going on?
If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
Luke is my nephew.
Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.
Grass, weed?
You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
Hey
Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.
Open your mouth.  Come on. Don't swallow it.
I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.
Grab you here.
What do you race cars?
[in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat]
Learn by touching.
No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
Wow.
Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?
Ah, still early.
Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
[talking head] This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be awesome. I've decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.
You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
[tossing pizza dough in the air]
Here we go.  Alright!
How you doin'? You excited.
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Oh God.
Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. [turns off tv]
[shakes head] Okay...
Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
Well, thats...
[on phone] Yes. Well... we can... [Sasha walks in, begins playing with Michael's toy train] uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. [Sasha moves the train to Michael's desk] Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?
That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
Hey, hey!
Ahhh.
I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
Okay.
Nurse.
You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..
This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.
Do what?
Thank you.
That's what I said.
Hello.
She was from Europe.
Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...
Uh...
Alright who's next?  Where's Andy?
Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
Wow, terminator, terminator.
This is perfect.
No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.
All right, let's start.
My last pay check?
Don't bother Luke.
Oh okay.  I don't know how those got on there...
No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
No. Hey... I mean, although it's just for fun, you know we want... I was counting on you man.
I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
Who you dating?
This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
[to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey!
Thank You!
Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!
Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.
Oscar! Think abou- Think! [door slams]
Come on, I'm going backwards.
Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
She's foreign.  I am--
Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers]
And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. [Jan on recording] 'Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.  I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.'  First impressions?
What!?
OK. Do you want me to repeat that?
And scene.
Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
... he cried at the end of it. He did.
I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.
Yes, about that.
I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them.
New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.
Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
[whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth]
Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
Were you listening to what I was saying?
Oh, she's great.
You, too, Dwight?
Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.
Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
And Cinco de Mayo.
No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?
Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
[scoffs] When have you ever done that?
Hooters?
All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.
Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.
Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.
Oh, really?
And you sent that out to everyone?
Oscar, I'm ready for you.
Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
Oh, I bet.
All right. All right. Bye.
Sits on a copier.
She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
Don't mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk]
[in video]...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
Damn it.
Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
Yeah.
I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.
Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
Take hedded of.
[holding up his 'World's Best Boss Mug'] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.
Surprise! [unveils bagels sitting on table] As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.
[looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
Oh... okay.  Were you saving it?
Wha - that's, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
Hey.
We got it.
Something is wrong with you.
Yesh.
No.
Write it down.
Well, yeah...
I'm out of answers Jan.
Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
Ah, thank you sir.
Ohh, God!
I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
[whispering] Dwight.
Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
No no no no no no!
Intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch. That is all.
Good.
Working on it.
Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
Five years old?
That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
Ahh, come on.
C'mon Jim, let's go.
Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.
Can you stop this?
And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera]  Jan, I defend your honor.  [to Dwight]  Is that all?
Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.
Do you ever miss us?
Oh, it smells good in here.
We don't need luck.
...in order to feed the bears.
[laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, Okay, here's a good one. Um...'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
Uh, well, I am. A little. Justifiably. My Halloween is ruined.
Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
Really?
Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
I love it more!
And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you'd be the weirdos.
Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.
Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
Well, I find it beautiful.
No, I think they're talking about me.
Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
Ah... .is that all you have to say?
Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
Well.
Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
Yeah, I am.  I am.
Dammit, Oscar!
And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
What has gotten into you?
Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]
The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.
Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?
[singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die?
I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
Mmm-hmm.
What's going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
Yes, yes. Assistant to  the regional manager.
Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone [shakes head] but I won't do it.
She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing]
Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.
Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.
That
[in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
Please, not at a time like this. [sighs]
No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
It's from James Bond.
I probably will, why do you ask?
Yeah.
What did you get tonight?
Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.
Who?
How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.
Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
Okay, then I want Pam back.
I am jetting off on an international business trip.
I'm right.
Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.
Okay.
Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch]
Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
Why don't you wanna go tonight?  What... all your friends are gonna be there.  It'll be fun.
Very good.
A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
You know what?  Actually, let's go into the conference room.
If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
I know.
Yeah, here we go. Ok.
Well...
I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.
I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.
All right.
Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
I do. She is.
Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar...
Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
I... I... Yes.
OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
Nice touch.  Good.  Let's try that again.
Mm, no...
They were so happy down there.
All-in. [Other players fold their hands]
Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?
