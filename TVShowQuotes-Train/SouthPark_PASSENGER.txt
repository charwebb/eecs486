Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey?
Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight.
He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.
Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy?
Ahh,  Excuse me, I think someone puked back here. 
I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.
Could you turn the radio down and the air conditioning up, please?
You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent.
You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'?
Well, whatever it is you're after, I hope you get it.
Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon?
That's the guy from Seinfeld, used the N-word a whole bunch o' times.
