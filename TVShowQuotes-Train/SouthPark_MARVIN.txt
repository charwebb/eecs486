Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy...  Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?

I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families.

Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!

Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around.

The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!

I ain't got one! You peckers took it!

Come over here you son of a whore! 

Gewhit * * Gewit um hebed wabaduh. Gabalah. 

Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!

I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!

The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right!  And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!

So now, what are we gonna do about it?

Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!

All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station.

Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!

You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!

The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!

I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.

And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!

Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? 

I'll be Goddamned if they think they can take my license away! 

God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!

All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime.

And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!

That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!

Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.

Oh, for me?  Oh! My God. There she is.  Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot.  Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?

Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!

That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about?  Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-

It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.

Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!

Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.

That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.

Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.

Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back.
