It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.
The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!
And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!
All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime.
I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!
That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.
Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.
I loved that dog. She always made me so happy. When she died, I... I didn't let myself get too sad, 'cause I thought, thought I'd always have the memory of her slobberin' happy face.  I can't remember what she looked like, Billy... Huh. Huohh. 
That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!
Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around.
Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy...  Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?
The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!
Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!
I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.
The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right!  And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!
And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!
Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
So now, what are we gonna do about it?
* * wughum chughum * *, * *.
Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!
You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!
Gewhit * * Gewit um hebed wabaduh. Gabalah. 
That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!
Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back.
Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.
Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.
Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!
I ain't got one! You peckers took it!
I'll be Goddamned if they think they can take my license away! 
Come over here you son of a whore! 
All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station.
That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about?  Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-
Duo bet tum debettum * * ghm * *?  Mah tah guum tyum * * ghm tm tm. 
God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!
Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson.  Come here, Billy.  You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy , to impress all the ladies .
*.  Mluglu dja mugm blugabeb * * *.
Oh, for me?  Oh! My God. There she is.  Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot.  Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?
