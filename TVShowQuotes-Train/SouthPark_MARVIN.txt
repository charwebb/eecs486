Gobede *. 

Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.

Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!

Sure. I'll drive.

We want our licenses back!

Come over here you son of a whore! 

Yes?

Gmmm?

Ingan *.

And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!

Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.

Gewhit * * Gewit um hebed wabaduh. Gabalah. 

You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!

Muwuhbuh * * mlamleblubluh mjek.

Eh?  Go around. Go around, you moron!

And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!

Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!

I ain't got one! You peckers took it!

That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.

That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!

The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right!  And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!

Well okay, good idea.Â 

Doundobi godia dyum * *

Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back.

Chede gwodum * * godom.

I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families.

Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson.  Come here, Billy.  You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy , to impress all the ladies .

Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!

Baba gook gook ba.

Gakchak ghm. 

Bongi groinit * *.

Six thousand dollars.

Dongdin * * mium bidu 

It's fun.

Gobin gobedo * * gowog. 

That's right.

Stupid son of a- God damnit!

Duo bet tum debettum * * ghm * *?  Mah tah guum tyum * * ghm tm tm. 

Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!

Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop.

* * wughum chughum * *, * *.

So now, what are we gonna do about it?

* * Muogleblabla mb'g * *.

Kiss my sagging ass!

I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.

Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!

Umi chu. 

The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!

Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof.

Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy...  Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?

Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? 

Gmm * Mmm-mm * *.

Midik, gmanjaum * *.

That's a good idea. 

That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!

Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?

Chak chak m geteaub m * *.

Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!

I'm proud of ya, Billy.

Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.

It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.

Okay, all set? 

Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around.

There he is! There's my grandson!

I'll be Goddamned if they think they can take my license away! 

The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!

What are you talkin' about?

I'm going.

*.  Mluglu dja mugm blugabeb * * *.

That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about?  Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-

Dor dor binor hm ghm.

All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime.

Badak bladla buk.

God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!

Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile?

Doye dondabuh. 

I loved that dog. She always made me so happy. When she died, I... I didn't let myself get too sad, 'cause I thought, thought I'd always have the memory of her slobberin' happy face.  I can't remember what she looked like, Billy... Huh. Huohh. 

Oh, for me?  Oh! My God. There she is.  Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot.  Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?

Dogom * Dommm * *.

All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station.

I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!
