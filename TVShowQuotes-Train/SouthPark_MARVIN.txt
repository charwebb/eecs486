Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around.
Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson.  Come here, Billy.  You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy , to impress all the ladies .
Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!
* * wughum chughum * *, * *.
That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!
All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime.
Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back.
Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!
Oh, for me?  Oh! My God. There she is.  Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot.  Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?
And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!
Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.
Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?
Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!
Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? 
The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right!  And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!
Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!

Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy...  Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?
Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.
You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!
I'll be Goddamned if they think they can take my license away! 
So now, what are we gonna do about it?
God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!
I ain't got one! You peckers took it!
I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!
I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.
Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.
All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station.
Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.

Come over here you son of a whore! 
And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!
That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!
That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about?  Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-
I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families.
