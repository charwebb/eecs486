Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...

Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?

I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing.  Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker. 

Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange. 

Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.

So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?

Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!

Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!

This is bullpucky!

Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage. 

Really?

Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.

Oh, lookie heeah!  I've gone and made a metal newspaper!

If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man.

F-really?

Come on guys. 

Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!

Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip.  Who could that be? 

Bay-bay! I'm hot.

...There's too many of them! 

Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you. 

We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.

I was getting a clue like every two minutes.

No, Mr. Mouse.

Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.

Pip, she started the device! 

Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-

Pip? Pip, old chap? 

Well, I gotta find somethin'.  My biceps are goin' flat.

Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'. 

Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!

'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!

Yeah, we've heard of that. We've also heard of the Declaration of Independence. See, there's a lot of people out there who think like you, people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens. That is, until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life. You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I can guarantee you.

Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel.

Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience.

Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.

It's a never-ending grind here at the NSA, and it seems there's never enough detectives to keep track of everyone.  Sergeant! What have you got, Larson.

So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?

I am, sir.

The seasons change.

Yeah. Uh huh.

Well. Um.  We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy.

Blow what?

'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!

Yeah, it sounds super-hard.

The same.

...Alright, keep an eye on them. Let me know if anything changes. 

What's that, Pip.

Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.

Take it easy.

That's great news! 

What have you got?

Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue.

You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.

Huh?

Alright, keep an eye on all three of them.

Oofff.

Yeah! 

We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.

Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?

Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?

Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now.

That's right. You're safe and warm now.

And the world goes round.

Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.

We don't care about the company.

Hello.

Pip!  A young gentleman! Of great expectations!

Whatchoo got, Miller.
