Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?
Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you. 
It's a never-ending grind here at the NSA, and it seems there's never enough detectives to keep track of everyone.  Sergeant! What have you got, Larson.
Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.
Oh, lookie heeah!  I've gone and made a metal newspaper!
Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.
And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it.  Your very own metal fuzzy dice.
We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
Alright, keep an eye on all three of them.
Yeah, we've heard of that. We've also heard of the Declaration of Independence. See, there's a lot of people out there who think like you, people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens. That is, until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life. You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I can guarantee you.
You won't care who's checkin' your Twitter account then. 
So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?
Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience.
Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.
This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.
Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue.
'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!
We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.
I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing.  Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker. 
Well, I gotta find somethin'.  My biceps are goin' flat.
So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?
I was getting a clue like every two minutes.
Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!
...Alright, keep an eye on them. Let me know if anything changes. 
Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now.
Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip.  Who could that be? 
Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage. 
Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'. 
Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.
Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!
You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town. 
If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man.
Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange.
