Whoa--uh--I'm really late. (leaves)
Do you mind?
Will you move it up a little bit?
He begged you?!
Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
Yeah.
Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack.
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!
Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was
Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
Oh, right.
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?
(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!
Oh. Let me see.
(a little anxious) Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.
Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
Hey Krame! You know this guy?
I can if I have room!
Welcome aboard.
(desperate) I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!
Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!
Is that Jerry? Jerry?!
I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.
What's the difference?
All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.
Hey, what time you got?
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!
Who are you?
Really?
I was closer to this space than you were.
(sees and is enthused, coming over) Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!
(comes up) Hey. Jerry.
No, I'm not gonna move the car.
Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
'Cause I don't have the money..
Yeah, I know Jerry.
(pauses, struck by J's attitude) Either of you guys wanna place a bet I'm your guy.
Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
Oh, you're not?
I don't know where it is.
And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
What are you asking this guy for?
I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
(desperately anxious) Oh God, I'm in trouble..
I think I'm parking my car.
Neither do I!
I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
Thumbs!
Well I'm going.
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.
Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
Why won't you go if I go?
Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?
No no, I was further in.
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!
Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?
