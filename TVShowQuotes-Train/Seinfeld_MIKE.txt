I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
(desperate) I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!
Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.
Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!
I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.
Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?
A flea market? You went to a flea market??
(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!
Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
(a little anxious) Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.
(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!
I was closer to this space than you were.
(from inside the trunk) Oh! Help! Somebody, help! Help!
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?
All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.
(pauses, struck by J's attitude) Either of you guys wanna place a bet I'm your guy.
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.
Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?
(sees and is enthused, coming over) Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!
(running in, still hoarse, desperate!) Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didn't commit suicide! (rushes up to podium!) She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!
Will you move it up a little bit?
