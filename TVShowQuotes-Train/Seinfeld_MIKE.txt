I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
Do you mind?
Oh, you're not?
(a little anxious) Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.
Yeah.
Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
He begged you?!
Oh, right.
Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
What are you asking this guy for?
Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack.
(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!
A flea market? You went to a flea market??
Who are you?
Hey, what time you got?
Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
Why won't you go if I go?
(desperately anxious) Oh God, I'm in trouble..
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?
Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was
Well I'm going.
All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.
I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.
Thumbs!
No, I'm not gonna move the car.
And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
Yeah, I know Jerry.
What's the difference?
No no, I was further in.
I think I'm parking my car.
Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.
(running in, still hoarse, desperate!) Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didn't commit suicide! (rushes up to podium!) She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!
(desperate) I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!
(comes up) Hey. Jerry.
(pauses, struck by J's attitude) Either of you guys wanna place a bet I'm your guy.
(sees and is enthused, coming over) Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!
What's up?
Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
Really?
Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!
I don't know where it is.
Welcome aboard.
Will you move it up a little bit?
I can if I have room!
(from inside the trunk) Oh! Help! Somebody, help! Help!
'Cause I don't have the money..
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!
Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!
Oh. Let me see.
Is that Jerry? Jerry?!
Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
Neither do I!
Hey Krame! You know this guy?
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. (leaves)
