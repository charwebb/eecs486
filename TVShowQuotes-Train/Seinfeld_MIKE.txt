(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
Welcome aboard.
I can if I have room!
Why won't you go if I go?
What are you asking this guy for?
(pauses, struck by J's attitude) Either of you guys wanna place a bet I'm your guy.
Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
Whoa--uh--I'm really late. (leaves)
Hey Krame! You know this guy?
Well I'm going.
What's up?
(a little anxious) Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.
(from inside the trunk) Oh! Help! Somebody, help! Help!
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!
Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
I think I'm parking my car.
All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.
(running in, still hoarse, desperate!) Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didn't commit suicide! (rushes up to podium!) She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!
(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!
I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
Neither do I!
I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
Yeah.
Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack.
What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.
Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?
I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.
Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
A flea market? You went to a flea market??
No no, I was further in.
Oh. Let me see.
Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
(comes up) Hey. Jerry.
Yeah, I know Jerry.
Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
Really?
Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
Hey, what time you got?
Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?
He begged you?!
'Cause I don't have the money..
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!
Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was
Thumbs!
I was closer to this space than you were.
Oh, right.
Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!
(sees and is enthused, coming over) Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!
Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
What's the difference?
Who are you?
Will you move it up a little bit?
And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
(desperately anxious) Oh God, I'm in trouble..
I don't know where it is.
Is that Jerry? Jerry?!
No, I'm not gonna move the car.
(desperate) I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!
