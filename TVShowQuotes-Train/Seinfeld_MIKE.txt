Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
Who are you?
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!
Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
Yeah.
(pauses, struck by J's attitude) Either of you guys wanna place a bet I'm your guy.
I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
(desperate) I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!
Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
(running in, still hoarse, desperate!) Hold on! Hol--on! Susie didn't commit suicide! (rushes up to podium!) She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!
Oh, you're not?
Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down the hall there and a small one over here. You know I should ask Jack.
Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
I can if I have room!
What's up?
(sees and is enthused, coming over) Kramer! Jerry! How's it goin'?!
Oh. Let me see.
(desperately anxious) Oh God, I'm in trouble..
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!
Thumbs!
Hey Krame! You know this guy?
I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.
Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?
(to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was double-parked, he was
Neither do I!
I think I'm parking my car.
Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!
(from inside the trunk) Oh! Help! Somebody, help! Help!
Welcome aboard.
Will you move it up a little bit?
Oh, right.
A flea market? You went to a flea market??
What are you asking this guy for?
All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file, you can start working on that.
What's the difference?
Really?
Yeah, I know Jerry.
'Cause I don't have the money..
(laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!
(a little anxious) Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.
I was closer to this space than you were.
He begged you?!
Kramer. Jerry still mad about that "phony" thing?
(comes up) Hey. Jerry.
I don't know where it is.
What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.
Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?
Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?
No no, I was further in.
I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
Why won't you go if I go?
No, I'm not gonna move the car.
Hey, what time you got?
