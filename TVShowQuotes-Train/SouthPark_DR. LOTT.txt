It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.
Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?
I just say that because you're my little buddy.
I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes.
Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new. 
All right. Time to laser me a little piggy. 
No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence.  I do not know how that happened.  "I am a little piggy." Wow! What are the odds of that?  All right, let's get down to business, shall we? 
Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?
Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right? 
You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.
Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests.
Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing.  All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
Hop up on the chair.  Don't break it now!
All right, we got the test results back, piggy-
All right, then let's get to work.  Say, you don't have three dollars and fifty cents on you, do you?
