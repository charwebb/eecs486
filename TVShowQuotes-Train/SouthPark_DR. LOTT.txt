No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence.  I do not know how that happened.  "I am a little piggy." Wow! What are the odds of that?  All right, let's get down to business, shall we? 
All right. Time to laser me a little piggy. 
I just say that because you're my little buddy.
Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests.
Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new. 
Hop up on the chair.  Don't break it now!
All right, then let's get to work.  Say, you don't have three dollars and fifty cents on you, do you?

I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.
All right, we got the test results back, piggy-
Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing.  All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes.
Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?
It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.
