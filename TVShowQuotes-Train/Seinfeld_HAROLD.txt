Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair.
Sure, sure. Shes getting a bargain, too. Its only four hundred dollars a month.
(to Manny) Whats the matter with you? Im talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?
Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I dont want to do it. Manny wants to do it.
I was only joking. (to Jerry) He thinks Im gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalkers things.
Im not the one who said eleven oclock. He makes up his own rules.
(to Jerry) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. Its a good thing her rent was overdue. Shed be rotting up there for a month.
You cant pick up anything with these! Theres no absorption!
Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalkers apartment?
Im not going up. It stinks up there.
Because its true! Why shouldnt I tell him?
Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me.
I told you I dont like these sponges, theyre too small! I want a big sponge!
Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported.
Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, well give it to her.
