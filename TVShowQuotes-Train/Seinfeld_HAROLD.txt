Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didnt have her wig on. It was horrifying.
Im not the one who said eleven oclock. He makes up his own rules.
Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalkers apartment?
Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair.
Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I dont want to do it. Manny wants to do it.
You cant pick up anything with these! Theres no absorption!
Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me.
I told you I dont like these sponges, theyre too small! I want a big sponge!
Im not going up. It stinks up there.
(to Manny) Whats the matter with you? Im talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?
Sure, sure. Shes getting a bargain, too. Its only four hundred dollars a month.
Because its true! Why shouldnt I tell him?
Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, well give it to her.
I was only joking. (to Jerry) He thinks Im gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalkers things.
Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported.
