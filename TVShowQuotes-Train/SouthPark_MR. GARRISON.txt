Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man.
Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. 
And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children.  Yeah.
Oh, thank God, Flora!  Alright, who do you vote for?
It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
Who should we call on next Mr. Hat?
Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight!  E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too?
Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of "grab ass."
Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat.
Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today.  Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?
That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!
That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...
We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. 
That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome. 
Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?
Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut.
That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave.  Now we'll get fired for sure!
For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!
One of you?!  We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!
Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, "fag". On television they usually don't allow "fag". But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, "shit," that means that finally I am free to say,Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do? Oh this is great!
"What's Vietnam?" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war.
Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. 
Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?
Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.
Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?  Yes, Eric?
This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?
Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage.  Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage .
At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning.
Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.
I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns! 
Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!
Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon. 
Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm.
Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could.  You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.
Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!
It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore. 
Okay, children, I want it quiet!  Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is six times three?
Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?
Look, there's more of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main.
I thought you just came from the bathroom.
Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  Yes, Eric?
Yeah.  Hey, rich guy!  Hey, Richie Rich! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook? 
Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. 
Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!  Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house! 
Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?
Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.
That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor.  Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs.  Yes, Filmore?
It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqu√© parts... 
Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!
Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel.
No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything? 
Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege.
In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
Everyone, let's give K. C. and his weed a big hand.  Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.
And never let poontang come between you and your friend.
I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...
Yeh-you don't say.  Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria.  Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay!
Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike.  And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for.  You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?
Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago. And I was only a child.
Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe.  That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing.
Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us!
Hokay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? 
Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. 
Oh brother.  Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?  And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there.
Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!
That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.
Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?
You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help.  And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. 
Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!
Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!
I can do this. I have to do this.  Hello. Dad.
Thank you for that presentation Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a "D-".
Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.
No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did.
Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon.
Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?
...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me.
What the hell is that?  Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom!  Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. 
But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.
And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes. 
That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?
I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.
And the winner of the costume contest is  Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! Come on up, Wendy. 
Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too.  Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?
What the hell are you talking about, Eric?
There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?
IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.
You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
Okay, children, let's take our seats.  We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. 
It's alright, it's just locking you in.  You can take it.  Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride?  Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off.  Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? 
Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey. 
And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon , and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? But where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- 
Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris?  Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung.  Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for...  Filmore.
Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag! You wanna make out or something?
He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!
We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat...  Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you?
Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.  A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
Come on you little bitch.  You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy.
Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season.
Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.
Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! 
Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people  for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame , but please, give her your full attention.  Go ahead.
We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to.
Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.
What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?
Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?!  Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a-  "...of liberty." You're late!  "...my father-" What the hell was that?!  God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!
Okay, children, let's take our seats.  My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little  "nervous breakdown" and went into the mountains where I lived off of "rat carcasses".  But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten.  But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?
Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?
And now number 17 many of you got wrong as well. The correct answer was D, whales are mammals. 
Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. 
I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp.
...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?  Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.  Okay.  Now let's practice our... 
Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon? 
Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.
They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
I told you never say his name in my presence.
I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. 
Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month?  One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.
Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Token , you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek.
Whereas salagadoola mechicka boola = x and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo is y, put 'em together and whattaya got? Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. x + y = y, x = 0. The song is badly written. Second verse: x + y = bibbidi-bobbidi cubed + boo-
That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!
Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy...
Oh, wuh, welluh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.
I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things.
Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?
You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow.
Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!
Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa! Who? Who are you?
And so, children, instead of saying "Hand in your papers," I may now say, "Hand in your shit." Any questions?
Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma.
Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.
M-m-m.  Oh, well, thank you!  You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad.  Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home.
Okay okay, go ahead.  As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. 
Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.
Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... 
SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! 
That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds.  You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.  Kenny, why are you late to class?  Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.  Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...  Yes Kenny, what is it?
Okay children, let's all take our seats.  As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.
Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.
I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad!  Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...
But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to...  Mr. Slave. 
Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.
It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.
Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here!
I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?
Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!
I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!
Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!
Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything!
But I never know what to write about.
Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?!
Run for your lives, children!  I'll try to fight it off!
Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits.
Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.
There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.
No, you got your door code, let us go!
And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains.
...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids.
Okay, Filmore.  You'll be our first nominee. And who else?  Yes, Jenny.
Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there‚Äîmy  ...father still lives there.
A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
You talkin' to me?  Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.
Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.
I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.
Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!
Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!
I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!
Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?
All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. 
Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!
They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?  Yes, Kyle?
Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides.
God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll make me well again.
I thought of it before you were born!
Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?
Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-? 
Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts
Oh yeah, now this is getting good 
Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard.
His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his
penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples
Uh, let's see...  Diana's nipples...  Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck.  Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat.
Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.
I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need.
Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it.
Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
Oh, boy, we're free!  Wow, what a daring rescue.  Mr. Hat!  Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!  Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat.
Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.
Do you have a feather on your head?
Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!
Well thanks. You too.  So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?
Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem!  Another Cosmo, please.
But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say "get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"
Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.
She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien. 
All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.
Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.  Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problems.
Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-
Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!
Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.
I can't kill her Mr. Hat. You're gonna have to do it. 
Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!
''Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there,-
Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.
Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!!  Go ahead.
...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.  Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh... 
Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!
Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.
We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!  Okay. I'm going to turn around now.  Shit!
Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
Now, pay attention. Ahem...
I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East 
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.
And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, 
Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday 
So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. 
There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. 
They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. 
They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.
And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,
Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. 
So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. 
Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,
Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. 
So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. 
On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
"Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you." 
Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat.
We can save the town and be super-rich!
I'll just... be going up to bed now.  Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?
Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves.
That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought. "Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? 
Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era.  Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...
Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, "Suck my balls," you say, "Present them."
Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!
Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me.
Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs!  Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!
I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.
I hope you give them the chair!  Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. 
Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go?  Okay Eric. 
Everyone pay attention!  Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- 
Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??
Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!
Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters.
You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!
Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth over.
Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!!  Go ahead.
That's it. Gyration.  A gyroscope.  It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius!  It's so simple and yet genius!
Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a- 
No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? 
All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.  Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.  This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.
Leave us. We must finish what we have begun. 
No! No, Filmore! You can say "I have to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have to poop," but not "I have to shit." Are we all clear?
How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase "t"!
Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better 'cause they're better people.
Oh yeah?!  I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final!  Let's just see you try and go without me!  Mi-Mr. Hat?
Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS!
Now, I don't really have any pajamas‚Äîguess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something.
Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff.
‚ÄîYou need to work on your study skills!
Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?
You're the ones who made it this way!
That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm.
Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! 
They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.
You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me.  I'll take it!
Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.
Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!
You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? I don't know, it's a little small.
Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--
Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it.  The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love.
Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence?  Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy? 
What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!!  We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again! 
Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us.
He's right. We don't have to call the police back.
...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!
No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on! 
You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react.  Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy
Okay, kids, get ready to take your places.
Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?
Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.
This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, "We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-"!
And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle.  All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... 
Will you kids shut up?  Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are not-! Oh my God, that's Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. 
Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering.  The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. 
Huh? Oh, oh, Wendy, uhhh, very nicely done. Thank you. Okay, next report,¬†¬†let's have uh, Peter Mullen.
Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.
It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete that?
Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there!  Get out of there!
Is there a problem Kenny?  Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?
Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie.
Saying "normal" is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group.  Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girls room!
And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a "Mongol," not to be confused with a "mongoloid" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what  ...year ...the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  That's odd.  Those ROTC guys are way off course. 
Say 'hi' to Damien!  And where are you from, Damien?
So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion dollar salaries!
Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.
No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months. 
Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?
Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat.
You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!! 
Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! 
Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford.
And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, "Thanksgiving, Mon Ami."
Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! 
That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman.
Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat.
Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's see. 
God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! 
Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.
Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ole Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!
Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!
Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?
Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad.  The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again.  Yes, Stanley?
Really? What did you like best about it?
Dad?  Pop, I'm just fast asleep‚ÄîI'm not hearing anything. 
Is he going to be all right, doctor?
This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
Your sister?!  Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss.  Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!
Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.
He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.
Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!
Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws. 
Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs!
They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes.
No I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!
What the? I tell you, there's some crazy stuff going on in this town.
All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? 
Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus.  Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G.
Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes.
Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.
Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit.
I think you're the loony one in this room.  Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo.
Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. 
What? Well of course I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more!
I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.
Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats.  Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel- 
Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you.  Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.
Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
We're out.  We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.
Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is?  Yes, Jenny?
Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!
Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama. 
It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave.
Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?
Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention.  Aaaaaah!  Ooooh.
And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?
And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol. 
They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! 
I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat.
Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true!  Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!
You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business!
Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers!
Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?
It can't be. These can't be right.  Mr. Hat!
I don't know Eric, they just do.  Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.
You can't close your eyes forever, Mother!  Mother, wait! 
Oh wait wait wait. Was it the pagan remark?
It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle?
I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell.
Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass.  No! Mr. Hat, you get back here! 
...And Mr. Twig is at home; he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history.
Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play.  The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus.
Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you.
My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.
Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner!
No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school.
Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?
Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president.
You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!!  Come on, everybody!
Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.
It is, too late for me, young Wendy.
I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.
You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!
You will be! You will be!  You will be.
So does anybody know  any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.  Yes, Eric?
Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too.
Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. 
So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's assistant.  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.
You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!
You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef?
Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring.
Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!
Okay, children, let's settle down!  Huhh I mean it; I want quiet!  My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin.  Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?!  Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex.  Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!
I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word "fag". So piss off, you fag-shitter! Heh, so hey there, shity shitty fag fagShitty shitty fag fag, ba doop a doop doo 
Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home! 
That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! 
Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle.
Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.
Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes.  Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers. 
Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse.
Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?
Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top.
Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?
Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes.
Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, "This is not a victimless crime"? Anybody?  Children, were you paying attention?!
Well, just make something up, like Eric did.
Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!  Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman? 
There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?
But the good news is,  I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher. 
Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase "t"! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!
Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't‚Äî
Eric I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.
"Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"
Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road.
Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie.  Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.
Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.
Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant.
Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls.
These pictures just arrived.  I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed.  Now, go arrest him!  What..?
Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!
I will  NOT put up with  TOM foolery in my  CLASS room, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth.  Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure. 
Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!
Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!
Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas! 
Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate...  uh-uh, what's your name again?
Well children, I'd love to, but the doctor say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.
And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  First of all you remove the condom from its package.  Then you find which way the condom rolls out.  Put it in your mouth...  And apply.  And it's as simple as that. Any questions?
Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear somethin' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake!
Olay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
Can we get rid of all the Mexicans?
Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? 
Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.
...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!
Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun. 
Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.
...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay.  Uh, can I help you?
"Current Events in South Park". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on.
Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better."
Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
Oh, and by the way, children, there's a walkout scheduled today to protest the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against the war, run along outside, and if you're for the war, uh, stay here and we'll do math problems. 
I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have.  Are there problems at home?
Yes! They were tryingn to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
Children, children! Today is a very special day.
Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?
Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--
We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone!  Well what are you waiting for?!
Yes.  Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit? 
That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!
Okay kids, there have been some hurtful and hateful things being said around this school, and so we are gonna hear from a guest speaker. Here to explain why Kim Kardashian is not a hobbit, please welcome, Aquaman.¬†
Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?
Not me! Not me not me not me not me! 
Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.
Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy! 
Was he on the school bus this morning?
Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-
Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?
Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!
Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.
Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doodoo at Eric?
It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible  is IT's patented gyroscope design.  Gentlemen, I give you, IT!
They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!!
And the presentation will be on national television.
...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?
Hurry up, children, let's take our seats.  You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy.  What's this? 
Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it!  I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!
No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper.
A note from the principal? "Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder."  Oh, brother!
In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president?  Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius.
Children, do you know how to file a police report?
Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.
Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds!  ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids.
Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.  And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?  Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.  Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.
Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!
And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, "The Miracle Worker." 
Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that?  You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head.  What kind of sick weirdo are you?
Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?
I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!
Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now. 
Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?
Okay, good. Just step through here  And then this is your steering and here's your throttle.
WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?!  You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!
Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!
Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. 
Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.
HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! 
I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!
What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-
Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes? 
Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.  Stanley, gay people... well- gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Naziesque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?
I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!
Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever!
Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-
I have to know why! Right here and now‚Äîwe're gonna talk about this!
Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?
Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America?  Ehyes, Mark?
So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know. 
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?
Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless.
I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
I'm going whether you like it or not!
Well, they can't use "fag". Because you can't say "fag" unless you're a homosexual.
Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision.
I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better?  I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever.  Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..?  Aaaggghhh!! Mr. Twig is broken in half! Who did this?!  You won't get away with this, you bastards!
Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!
All right boys, show us what you've brought. 
I just act that way to get chicks, dumb ass. 
Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.
Hoh Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job. 
Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?
Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too.
Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. 
Oh well-  Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave.  The parents have to see for themselves.  The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!
Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!  How can gay men do this to their own people??  Unless... you're not gay at all... 
We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!
I'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard.  Really long and really hard. 
What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?
Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! 
Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.
There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you. 
Oh dear.  Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it. 
Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda.
Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.
Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?!  That's what I thought! Now pay attention!  Okay, children, now, the biggest fatass was an old skank by the name of-
Hoh, wow! You don't see that every day!
Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.
Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!
And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better.  Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president,  so first we must pick nominees.  Who would like to nominate someone?
That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look?
Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials. 
So now, can you please change your network's programming?
Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'.  Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project.
How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans? 
Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time!  Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight.  Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum...
Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
O-kay!  Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?
Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy.
How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?
See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan.
That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.
Very well, I guess you're excused from homework.
They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today.  Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?
Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?
Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan.
What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, "The ball is red..." 
How?  No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!
Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!
Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mis-Mr. Twig?  Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!
Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about.
Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!
And I can't sleep or think...  Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. 
Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus.
"But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."
Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.
No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board.
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!  Oh my God, what have I said?
You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!
It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--
Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.
But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.
Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  "Tolerate" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!
Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.
I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing Jimbo.
All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. 
Okay, children, does eveyone have their leotards on? 
Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!
Pay attention children!  I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever.
Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.
Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
