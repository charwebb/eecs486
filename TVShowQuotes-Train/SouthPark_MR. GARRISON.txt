Whereas salagadoola mechicka boola = x and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo is y, put 'em together and whattaya got? Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. x + y = y, x = 0. The song is badly written. Second verse: x + y = bibbidi-bobbidi cubed + boo-
Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat.
Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts
Oh yeah, now this is getting good 
Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard.
His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his
penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples
Uh, let's see...  Diana's nipples...  Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck.  Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat.
Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?
Everyone pay attention!  Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- 
Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!
Okay, children, let's take our seats.  We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. 
I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!
...And Mr. Twig is at home; he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history.
Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. 
Hoh Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job. 
That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment!  Take it Mr. Slave! 
Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless.
Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!  Okay. I'm going to turn around now.  Shit!
Dad?  Pop, I'm just fast asleepâ€”I'm not hearing anything. 
It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.
I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.
Children, do you know how to file a police report?
That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave.  Now we'll get fired for sure!
Yes.  Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit? 
Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could.  You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.
...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!
Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.
Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doodoo at Eric?
A note from the principal? "Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder."  Oh, brother!
This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
Very well, I guess you're excused from homework.
Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman. 
That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought. "Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? 
No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did.
She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.
I hope you give them the chair!  Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. 
Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!
How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase "t"!
You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!
Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!
Okay children, let's all take our seats.  As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.
Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.
Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate...  uh-uh, what's your name again?
Hoh, wow! You don't see that every day!
Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. 
He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.
Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!
Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people  for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame , but please, give her your full attention.  Go ahead.
You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!  Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house! 
Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff.
For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!
Look, there's more of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main.
Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?
It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave.
Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.
Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig.
We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to.
O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history.  Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972?  Yes?
Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring.
Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!
Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.
Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?
I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!
There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama. 
Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.
At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning.
It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete that?
Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head 
A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!
Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?!  You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!
Not me! Not me not me not me not me! 
I'm going whether you like it or not!
My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.
You talkin' to me?  Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.
I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have.  Are there problems at home?
Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. 
Yeh-you don't say.  Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria.  Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay!
It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--
Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence?  Hmm, what are the odds of that?
Leave us. We must finish what we have begun. 
All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? 
''Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there,-
There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
Oh, thank God, Flora!  Alright, who do you vote for?
Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.
Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth over.
Okay, Filmore.  You'll be our first nominee. And who else?  Yes, Jenny.
But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.
Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is?  Yes, Jenny?
Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?
Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa! Who? Who are you?
And never let poontang come between you and your friend.
Say 'hi' to Damien!  And where are you from, Damien?
I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing Jimbo.
They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... 
Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn'tâ€”
Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is  Mr. Garrison.
Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?
Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase "t"! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!
And now number 17 many of you got wrong as well. The correct answer was D, whales are mammals. 
But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision.
That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!
Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers!
Hokay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? 
You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!
Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now. 
Oh wait wait wait. Was it the pagan remark?
Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top.
Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home! 
Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.
I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad!  Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...
Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month?  One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.
I'll just... be going up to bed now.  Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans? 
Thank you for that presentation Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a "D-".
That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor.  Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs.  Yes, Filmore?
HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! 
Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie.
Children, I have a very important announcement to make.  I'm quitting my job as a teacher. 
Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie.  Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.
Okay, children, let's take our seats.  My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little  "nervous breakdown" and went into the mountains where I lived off of "rat carcasses".  But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten.  But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?
It can't be. These can't be right.  Mr. Hat!
Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. 
I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!
It is, too late for me, young Wendy.
Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!
Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished.
Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!
Now, I don't really have any pajamasâ€”guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something.
God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll make me well again.
Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.
Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?
So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike.  And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for.  You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?
Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??
Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!
Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here!
Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws. 
No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!
I can't kill her Mr. Hat. You're gonna have to do it. 
We're out.  We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.
That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome. 
Oh dear.  Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it. 
I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word "fag". So piss off, you fag-shitter! Heh, so hey there, shity shitty fag fagShitty shitty fag fag, ba doop a doop doo 
Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus.
Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.
Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
Is there a problem Kenny?  Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?
I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat.
Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it!   Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year.
Oh well-  Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave.  The parents have to see for themselves.  The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!
Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds!  ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids.
Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?
...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay.  Uh, can I help you?
Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live thereâ€”my  ...father still lives there.
Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.
Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-? 
I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm.
That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.
Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too.  Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?
You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef?
That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
Eric I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.
Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?
Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.
And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon , and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? But where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- 
Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. 
And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains.
Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!
No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything? 
Good.  Very good.  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.
Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!
Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat.
Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit.
Run for your lives, children!  I'll try to fight it off!
Okay, kids, get ready to take your places.
Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse.
Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  "Tolerate" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!
And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.
Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.
What the hell are you talking about, Eric?
Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! 
What the? I tell you, there's some crazy stuff going on in this town.
Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!
Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?
I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know.
Do you have a feather on your head?
Is he going to be all right, doctor?
They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
Was he on the school bus this morning?
I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, "The ball is red..." 
That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!
And so, children, instead of saying "Hand in your papers," I may now say, "Hand in your shit." Any questions?
You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me.  I'll take it!
Will you kids shut up?  Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are not-! Oh my God, that's Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. 
They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?
I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. 
Well, just make something up, like Eric did.
Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left.  I'm not going to take you back.  You can just go to hell!  You go to hell and you die!  You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!  I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!  What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.
Well, they can't use "fag". Because you can't say "fag" unless you're a homosexual.
There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
I told you never say his name in my presence.
What the...?  Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.  Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself! 
Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?
I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. 
Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?!  Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a-  "...of liberty." You're late!  "...my father-" What the hell was that?!  God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!
Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time!  Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight.  Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum...
Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too.
Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so.
Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look?
...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!
I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!
Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey. 
Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun. 
Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?!
Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.
Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on! 
Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!!  We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again! 
...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.
Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, "fag". On television they usually don't allow "fag". But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, "shit," that means that finally I am free to say,Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do? Oh this is great!
Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it.  The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love.
You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!
I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle?
So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion dollar salaries!
No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months. 
It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risquÃ© parts... 
Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--
Olay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.
Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man.
It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible  is IT's patented gyroscope design.  Gentlemen, I give you, IT!
Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a- 
It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore. 
Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?
Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids.
Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy! 
Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.
Hurry up, children, let's take our seats.  You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy.  What's this? 
It's alright, it's just locking you in.  You can take it.  Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride?  Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off.  Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? 
No! No, Filmore! You can say "I have to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have to poop," but not "I have to shit." Are we all clear?
...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?
Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs!
I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell.
Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too.
Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?
Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--
Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag! You wanna make out or something?
And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.
Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that?  You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head.  What kind of sick weirdo are you?
And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle.  All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... 
Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.  Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-
Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions?  Yes, Stan?
Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence?  Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy? 
Well children, I'd love to, but the doctor say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.
Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford.
Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!  How can gay men do this to their own people??  Unless... you're not gay at all... 
Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves.
We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS!
That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?
Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.
Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say "get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"
Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, "The Miracle Worker." 
I think you're the loony one in this room.  Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo.
I can do this. I have to do this.  Hello. Dad.
So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's assistant.  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.
Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! 
Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!
Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!
Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today.  Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?
Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me.
Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.
Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle.
Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!
Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?
I will  NOT put up with  TOM foolery in my  CLASS room, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth.  Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure. 
Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon.
Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. 
Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.
Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!
Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!
â€”You need to work on your study skills!
You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?  Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!  The prank is over!  You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch.  God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?! 
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!  Oh my God, what have I said?
Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  Yes, Eric?
Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era.  Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...
And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus.
Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it.
Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road.
Yes! They were tryingn to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. 
And I can't sleep or think...  Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?
You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes. 
Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, "Suck my balls," you say, "Present them."
Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.
SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! 
Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!
Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us.
Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of "grab ass."
"But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."
Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.
Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?
Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure.
Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?
Ogod, you're not gonna lay that Channukah crap on me, are you?
Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda.
Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!
Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.
Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.
Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.
THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!!
I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.
Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.
In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president?  Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius.
Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight!  E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too?
Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?!  That's what I thought! Now pay attention!  Okay, children, now, the biggest fatass was an old skank by the name of-
O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?
Yeah.  Hey, rich guy!  Hey, Richie Rich! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook? 
Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...
What the hell is that?  Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom!  Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. 
What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!!  Come on, everybody!
But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.
He's right. We don't have to call the police back.
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today.  Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?
Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!
That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds.  You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.  Kenny, why are you late to class?  Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.  Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...  Yes Kenny, what is it?
Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege.
Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!
Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack.
This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!
Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!
Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.
We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!
One of you?!  We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!
You will be! You will be!  You will be.
Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need.
We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone!  Well what are you waiting for?!
M-m-m.  Oh, well, thank you!  You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad.  Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home.
Oh, boy, we're free!  Wow, what a daring rescue.  Mr. Hat!  Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!  Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat.
Children, children! Today is a very special day.
They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.
And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, "Thanksgiving, Mon Ami."
Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris?  Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung.  Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for...  Filmore.
Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!!  Go ahead.
Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?
Oh, wuh, welluh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.
You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business!
And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children.  Yeah.
I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.
Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? 
Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
Huh? Oh, oh, Wendy, uhhh, very nicely done. Thank you. Okay, next report,Â Â let's have uh, Peter Mullen.
I thought of it before you were born!
Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?
All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner!
Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs!  Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!
Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you.
Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father!
Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls.
Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon? 
Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!
Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!
Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.
All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. 
You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!! 
Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas! 
Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides.
We can save the town and be super-rich!
Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes.
...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?  Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.  Okay.  Now let's practice our... 
I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better?  I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever.  Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..?  Aaaggghhh!! Mr. Twig is broken in half! Who did this?!  You won't get away with this, you bastards!
Come on you little bitch.  You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy.
Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Oowww! 
Saying "normal" is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group.  Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girls room!
WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
These pictures just arrived.  I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed.  Now, go arrest him!  What..?
Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.  A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
Oh yeah?!  I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final!  Let's just see you try and go without me!  Mi-Mr. Hat?
Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy...
No, you got your door code, let us go!
All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.  Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.  This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.
Can we get rid of all the Mexicans?
Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!
Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.
Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! 
Oh, and by the way, children, there's a walkout scheduled today to protest the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against the war, run along outside, and if you're for the war, uh, stay here and we'll do math problems. 
And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better.  Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president,  so first we must pick nominees.  Who would like to nominate someone?
Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together?  Let's see, how about...
Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus.  Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G.
That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm.
Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.  Stanley, gay people... well- gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Naziesque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?
Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true!  Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!
Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.
Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!!  Go ahead.
Really? What did you like best about it?
Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch.
Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?
I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp.
Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant.
I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things.
Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma.
Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!
No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school.
There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?
Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.
Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters.
They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes.
Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.
Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.
Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials. 
I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us!
Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.
O-kay!  Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?
Who should we call on next Mr. Hat?
Pay attention children!  I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever.
No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me. 
Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problems.
"What's Vietnam?" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war.
Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's see. 
I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?
Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?
Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!
Okay, children, I want it quiet!  Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is six times three?
...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me.
I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns! 
Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?
Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.
Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react.  Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy
Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear somethin' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake!
Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there!  Get out of there!
Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?
Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!
How?  No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!
Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.
That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!
Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis.  He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste.
Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!
Okay okay, go ahead.  As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. 
But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to...  Mr. Slave. 
It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-
How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?
Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes.
Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. 
NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  First of all you remove the condom from its package.  Then you find which way the condom rolls out.  Put it in your mouth...  And apply.  And it's as simple as that. Any questions?
Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage.  Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage .
In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go?  Okay Eric. 
This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, "We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-"!
Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.
Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut.
No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board.
We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat...  Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you?
She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien. 
And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Uh, boys!  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?
Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!  Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman? 
And the presentation will be on national television.
I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!
Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch.
All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. 
All right boys, show us what you've brought. 
Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? 
Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.
Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!
What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?
God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! 
Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes? 
Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! 
Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! 
Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, "This is not a victimless crime"? Anybody?  Children, were you paying attention?!
Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!
What? Well of course I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more!
Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez.
Now, pay attention. Ahem...
I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East 
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.
And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, 
Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday 
So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. 
There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. 
They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. 
They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.
And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,
Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. 
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. 
So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. 
Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,
Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. 
So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. 
On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
"Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you." 
Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat.
And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. 
There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce.  Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.
What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?
Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better 'cause they're better people.
I thought you just came from the bathroom.
Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan.
You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? I don't know, it's a little small.
Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.
There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?
Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!
Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America?  Ehyes, Mark?
Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!
So does anybody know  any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.  Yes, Eric?
That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...
Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat.
Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever!
...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda. 
Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.
Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?
And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol. 
"Current Events in South Park". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on.
So now, can you please change your network's programming?
You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help.  And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. 
Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.  And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?  Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.  Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.
I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.
I don't know Eric, they just do.  Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.
No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper.
You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!
But I never know what to write about.
Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?
Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?  Yes, Eric?
And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a "Mongol," not to be confused with a "mongoloid" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what  ...year ...the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  That's odd.  Those ROTC guys are way off course. 
I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! 
Well thanks. You too.  So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?
Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?
Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!
Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!
No I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!
Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.
Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play.  The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus.
Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.
Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?
You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow.
Your sister?!  Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss.  Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!
What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
Oh brother.  Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?  And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there.
Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?
I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.
Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?
Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! 
...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such.  Put the four together and we're ready to go. 
See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan.
Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes.  Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers. 
IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.
And the winner of the costume contest is  Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! Come on up, Wendy. 
Mr. Mackey, can he just go talk to the principal?
Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you.  Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.
Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy.
Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Token , you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek.
Everyone, let's give K. C. and his weed a big hand.  Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.
Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.
Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?
Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-
Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad.  The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again.  Yes, Stanley?
I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.
It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks.
I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!
Okay kids, there have been some hurtful and hateful things being said around this school, and so we are gonna hear from a guest speaker. Here to explain why Kim Kardashian is not a hobbit, please welcome, Aquaman.Â 
Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?
You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
Okay, good. Just step through here  And then this is your steering and here's your throttle.
Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe.  That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing.
Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?
Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention.  Aaaaaah!  Ooooh.
Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather.
