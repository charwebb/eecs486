You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. 
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.
Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.
Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-
Dad, I want to join the basketball team. 
It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.
I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.
Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.
East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.
I know. That's kind of why I like it.
It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.
