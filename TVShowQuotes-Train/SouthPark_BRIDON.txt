I don't know...

East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.

I'm ready, coach.

It's my life, Dad!

Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.

Uhh, sure. 

Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me.

You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. 

This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.

No! I'm sick of singing!

Hey.

Special in their own way!

Okay.

It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.

Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-

Really?

Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.

I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.

No, Dad, can we just talk?

Look, I should be getting to class.

They are?

Yeah, great.

Dad, stop!

Huh?

Just let me go.

Hey.

You're hurting my arm.

It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.

I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.

I know. That's kind of why I like it.

Thanks.

Dad, I was just messin' around.

I can't.

Hi.

Dad, I want to join the basketball team.
