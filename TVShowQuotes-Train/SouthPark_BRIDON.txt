I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.
I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.
Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.
Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-
You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. 
It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.
I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.
It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.
I know. That's kind of why I like it.
Dad, I want to join the basketball team.
