I know. That's kind of why I like it.

Hi.

Okay.

Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me.

I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.

I'm ready, coach.

It's my life, Dad!

But Dad, it's what I really want.

Really?

They are?

I can't.

No! I'm sick of singing!

Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.

You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. 

I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.

Thanks.

This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.

Yeah, great.

Dad, stop!

Look, I should be getting to class.

I don't know...

Special in their own way!

It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.

Hey.

You're hurting my arm.

Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-

Dad, I was just messin' around.

Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.

No, Dad, can we just talk?

Just let me go.

It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.

East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.

Uhh, sure. 

Let it out! Party people!

Hey.
