Wow, ah I'm sorry. I totally respect that.  Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.
Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. 
It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence.
Token, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Oh gee, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.
I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter.
Look!  Somebody left a deli platter.  And board games. And massage oil.
Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been reeeally scary.
Yeahh, it kind of was. Maybe... uh I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.
That kid, with the orange coat and the greet hat?
Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.
I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?
