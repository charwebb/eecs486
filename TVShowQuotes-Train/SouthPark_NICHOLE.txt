Token. Hey.

Oh gee, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.

OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry!

Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been reeeally scary.

Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out.

Yeah.

Look!  Somebody left a deli platter.  And board games. And massage oil.

Hello??

You think the janitors are still here?

Oh, he does?  Okay.

Coach wanted me to...  I'm sorry. 

Oh no, who told you that?

His name is Token. He's really nice.

Hey Token.

Let them look. I don't care.

Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. 

Where are you going?

Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.

Wow, ah I'm sorry. I totally respect that.  Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.

It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence.

Token, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black.

Okay. 

Ohhh.

So?

Maybe we can give it another try?

Well that was sure an interesting night.

Can I talk to you for a sec?

That kid, with the orange coat and the greet hat?

I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter.

I think you're really great... Ww-we just...

Oh no...

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?

He did that? Oh no.

Cool. Well... thanks again. 

Yeahh, it kind of was. Maybe... uh I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.
