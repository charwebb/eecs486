Cool. Well... thanks again. 

Where are you going?

It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence.

Can I talk to you for a sec?

...I'm sorry.

Look!  Somebody left a deli platter.  And board games. And massage oil.

Hey Token.

His name is Token. He's really nice.

He did that? Oh no.

Oh gee, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.

Token. Hey.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Ohhh.

You think the janitors are still here?

Yeah.

Oh, he does?  Okay.

Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.

OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry!

Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out.

I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter.

Yeah. 

Hello??

Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. 

Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been reeeally scary.

Okay. 

Wow, ah I'm sorry. I totally respect that.  Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.

Oh no, who told you that?

Coach wanted me to...  I'm sorry. 

I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?

Token, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black.

Maybe we can give it another try?

Yeahh, it kind of was. Maybe... uh I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.

That kid, with the orange coat and the greet hat?

Oh no...

So?

Well that was sure an interesting night.
