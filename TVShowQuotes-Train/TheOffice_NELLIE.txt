Psst. Say, 'So who's leading this thing, anyway?'
I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
Today, I launch my big charity initiative ���Operation Give Back���. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I���d like to see him piss on that one.
I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
���Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.���
Oh, well good for you. I mean, you���ll need a prescription.
It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?
The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%.  Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?
Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
[Reading] ���She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.���
[As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace.
[Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
You are gonna bloody ruin it. You���re gonna bloody ruin it because you���re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
That���s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I���ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.
On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  [hugs Pam]
oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
Oh, it���s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
Do you think I���d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We���ll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won���t we?
I���m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let���s-- let���s use an example. Take Erin. Erin���s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ���full-ass��� it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? [knocks] [Dwight turns off the lights] Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? [knocks] Dwight? [whispers] Dwight. [Dwight eats his Bananas Foster]
I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
They���re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.
Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
[to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
And the answer��� is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich.  Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim].
Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?
Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
What is the delay here? Where���s Ryan? Why is he not here?
By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.
well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? [Toby nods] One week? [Toby shakes head] Ok, two weeks? [Toby nods] Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. �����Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.��� I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?
All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ���I'm amazing.���
Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.
Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You���re welcome, Andy. And you���re welcome, my own ass.
I got your voicemail. From ��� from last night.
I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.
Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
And then we thought we���d ��� I can���t. I just can���t  carry on with that face. Look at it. I���m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he���s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.
Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ���Hello. Hi sweetie. It���s Jim. I���m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.���
Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
No, let���s-- let���s-- let���s not say Creed. Let���s say Mr. X.
Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.
Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
[at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would���[hit in the face with trash]
Here���s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
It���s just that I am taking my driver���s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to ���Demandy���...[Points to Andy's office with her thumb].  I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But���in who's car?
Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
Okay, look Dwight, let���s just call this thing off. I mean, it���s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
[Put her finger to his lips again] Shh.
All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, ���looking for dirt.���
Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick [points to Pam]
Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!
So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?
Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?
I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
[whispers] Pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy���s head].
No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.
Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It���s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods]
Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship.
Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
I wasn���t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
The way he just cuts off his arm.
The black one. I never stood a chance.
But he���s flirting with Jim���s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.
Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
Mmmm���the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I���m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.
We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?
Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn���t even get a callback.
Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.
Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I���m this patrician goddess. But here���s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ��� what���s lower than dirt?
What did I just say? What did I just say?
Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
We are now down to an elite eight.  Well, seven and Toby.
Hmm? Oh���oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  I'm mean, I d���I just don't wanna���burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will��� who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
���A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.���
Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And��� I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
Yes! You! You are soo talented! It���s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton���s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don���t you just have some more coffee?
Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.
I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.
Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
Pam, what is your address? I���m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don���t ���
Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-
[Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies. [cheers, claps]
And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?
Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just��� you three, no.
There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
Hmm. Yeah. ��All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...
Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we���re going to be in so much trouble!
Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't 'a good fit-'
That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I���ve tried so far is Alpine Select!
Ok, that's enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
Oh. Oh, I���ll tell you what he does.
She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
You���ve just got me started. Robert��� is��� a filthy beast. I mean, don���t you get the feeling, he���s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
[laughing] It���s funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]
Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he���s a good man and that I hope he feels better.
Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I���m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can���t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says ���Now Pants���] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.
So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
It's the apology. I really have to insist.
It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.
Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Dwight, our co-workers��� health issues are really none of our business so-
Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
���In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There���s Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.���
With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.
Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
I didn���t really think about it like that.
Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
Psst. Say, 'I can't wait to meet him.'
I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
Oh, thank you. I don���t know, I sort of thought--
I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let���s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
