For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich.  Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim].
Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. [both laugh at Clark]
oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
Hmm. Yeah. ��All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...
Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.
Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?
I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
They���re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I���ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.
I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
Here���s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn���t even get a callback.
All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
And the answer��� is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.
God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
[at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
I���m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let���s-- let���s use an example. Take Erin. Erin���s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says ���Now Pants���] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.
What is the delay here? Where���s Ryan? Why is he not here?
You are gonna bloody ruin it. You���re gonna bloody ruin it because you���re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will��� who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
Oh, well good for you. I mean, you���ll need a prescription.
Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would���[hit in the face with trash]
You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
The black one. I never stood a chance.
And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.
[As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.
Yes! You! You are soo talented! It���s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton���s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies. [cheers, claps]
I didn���t really think about it like that.
Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. �����Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.��� I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
And then we thought we���d ��� I can���t. I just can���t  carry on with that face. Look at it. I���m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he���s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?
Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
I got your voicemail. From ��� from last night.
You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.
You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
Oh, your mom���s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. ���Do Not Disturb��� sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?
That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don���t you just have some more coffee?
Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
Okay, look Dwight, let���s just call this thing off. I mean, it���s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?
Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  [hugs Pam]
[Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
Oh, it���s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
It���s just that I am taking my driver���s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to ���Demandy���...[Points to Andy's office with her thumb].  I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But���in who's car?
Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-
Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
[laughing] It���s funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]
Do you think I���d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Hmm? Oh���oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  I'm mean, I d���I just don't wanna���burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let���s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?
Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.
I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ���I'm amazing.���
Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?
You���ve just got me started. Robert��� is��� a filthy beast. I mean, don���t you get the feeling, he���s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
Mmmm���the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I���m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%.  Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?
I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
[to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?
If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.
[quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.
[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
���In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There���s Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.���
So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I���m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can���t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? [Toby nods] One week? [Toby shakes head] Ok, two weeks? [Toby nods] Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
Oh. Oh, I���ll tell you what he does.
Pam, what is your address? I���m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don���t ���
Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just��� you three, no.
[whispers] Pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy���s head].
We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!
Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I���m this patrician goddess. But here���s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ��� what���s lower than dirt?
Dwight, our co-workers��� health issues are really none of our business so-
Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.
Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.
[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
Ok, that's enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods]
���Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.���
I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'Yes!' So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?
When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
It���s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I���m not ashamed of that, But I���m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, ���looking for dirt.���
And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we���re going to be in so much trouble!
Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship.
And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he���s a good man and that I hope he feels better.
I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
Yeah, you���re right. This man needs to be apprehended.
The way he just cuts off his arm.
Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Oh, thank you. I don���t know, I sort of thought--
But he���s flirting with Jim���s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.
Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And��� I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
I wasn���t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.
You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? [knocks] [Dwight turns off the lights] Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? [knocks] Dwight? [whispers] Dwight. [Dwight eats his Bananas Foster]
Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
It's the apology. I really have to insist.
I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget.
Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
No, let���s-- let���s-- let���s not say Creed. Let���s say Mr. X.
[Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
Psst. Say, 'So who's leading this thing, anyway?'
Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.
So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.
Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
And Filipino. But we���ll break that to her later.
Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
[Reading] ���She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.���
Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace.
Yes. I thought I���d you know, be you.
Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick [points to Pam]
Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
We are now down to an elite eight.  Well, seven and Toby.
Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ���full-ass��� it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.
