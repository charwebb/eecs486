Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
I didn���t really think about it like that.
[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?
Yeah, you���re right. This man needs to be apprehended.
Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
What did I just say? What did I just say?
Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.
[whispers] Pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy���s head].
We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?
Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we���re going to be in so much trouble!
[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich.  Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim].
[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
I wasn���t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will��� who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace.
Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just��� you three, no.
Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ���Hello. Hi sweetie. It���s Jim. I���m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.���
Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
It���s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I���m not ashamed of that, But I���m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.
Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You���re welcome, Andy. And you���re welcome, my own ass.
I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
What is the delay here? Where���s Ryan? Why is he not here?
You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
[Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?
Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.
I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.
Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And��� I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says ���Now Pants���] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.
I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't 'a good fit-'
Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. �����Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.��� I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I���ve tried so far is Alpine Select!
[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.
Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he���s a good man and that I hope he feels better.
Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship.
I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
Do you think I���d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?
[quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
Oh, your mom���s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. ���Do Not Disturb��� sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
Yes! You! You are soo talented! It���s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton���s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We���ll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won���t we?
Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
[at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don���t you just have some more coffee?
What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ���full-ass��� it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.
No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
The black one. I never stood a chance.
Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.
Hmm? Oh���oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  I'm mean, I d���I just don't wanna���burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
And then we thought we���d ��� I can���t. I just can���t  carry on with that face. Look at it. I���m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he���s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.
Oh. Oh, I���ll tell you what he does.
Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
���In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There���s Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.���
That���s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'Yes!' So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?
So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick [points to Pam]
Oh, thank you. I don���t know, I sort of thought--
So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I���ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.
It���s just that I am taking my driver���s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to ���Demandy���...[Points to Andy's office with her thumb].  I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But���in who's car?
Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
���A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.���
Ok, that's enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
[As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
You are gonna bloody ruin it. You���re gonna bloody ruin it because you���re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
It's the apology. I really have to insist.
The way he just cuts off his arm.
Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
Oh, it���s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  [hugs Pam]
My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods]
So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
Here���s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
[Reading] ���She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.���
I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, ���looking for dirt.���
No, let���s-- let���s-- let���s not say Creed. Let���s say Mr. X.
Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.
Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
[Put her finger to his lips again] Shh.
So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.
This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Dwight, our co-workers��� health issues are really none of our business so-
You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?
You���ve just got me started. Robert��� is��� a filthy beast. I mean, don���t you get the feeling, he���s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
Hmm. Yeah. ��All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...
The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I���m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can���t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
���Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.���
In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
Okay, look Dwight, let���s just call this thing off. I mean, it���s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ���I'm amazing.���
My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. [both laugh at Clark]
Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I���m this patrician goddess. But here���s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ��� what���s lower than dirt?
My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.
Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
Psst. Say, 'So who's leading this thing, anyway?'
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.
[laughing] It���s funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]
Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
I got your voicemail. From ��� from last night.
Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
Yes. I thought I���d you know, be you.
Psst. Say, 'I can't wait to meet him.'
She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It���s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
Today, I launch my big charity initiative ���Operation Give Back���. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I���d like to see him piss on that one.
I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn���t even get a callback.
I���m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let���s-- let���s use an example. Take Erin. Erin���s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
They���re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
Mmmm���the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I���m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
And the answer��� is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? [Toby nods] One week? [Toby shakes head] Ok, two weeks? [Toby nods] Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?
All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.
Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
