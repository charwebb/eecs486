Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
Mm-hmm.
The black one. I never stood a chance.
It's the apology. I really have to insist.
I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
Have you seen Darryl?
What should we say about Jim?
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Angela advances.
Next up we have Dwight and Phyllis.
You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?
It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
���In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There���s Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.���
Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.
God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
I'm trying to adopt a baby.
You're the stupid one.
Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?
Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
We are now down to an elite eight.  Well, seven and Toby.
Oh, your mom���s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. ���Do Not Disturb��� sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who?
A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
Do you want to go again?
I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
[nail stylist 2 giggles] What?
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
Wow.
Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
Oh, gosh.
Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
Stop saying no.
Oh!
No.
Oh, thank you. I don���t know, I sort of thought--
Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.
How you doing?
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Okay, look Dwight, let���s just call this thing off. I mean, it���s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
Yes, Robert!
I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
Absolutely not. Seven percent.
This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
Oh, you signed it?
And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It���s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
Andy.
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I���ve tried so far is Alpine Select!
Yes. [Kisses Toby]
I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking���a mural.
Psst. Say, 'So who's leading this thing, anyway?'
That���s....
Alright then.
Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
Allow me to solve your problem, then.
Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
What did I just say? What did I just say?
Performance reviews.
Were they angry?
I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
Dwight, what about you?
Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I���ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.
What do you mean?
Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich.  Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim].
Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? [knocks] [Dwight turns off the lights] Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? [knocks] Dwight? [whispers] Dwight. [Dwight eats his Bananas Foster]
Oh, god, Pam. Don���t get me started.
Blow in my ear.
Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will��� who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
Oh, good lord.
Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
Andy.
[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?
Oh, please don't use the hourglass.
Or what's her name.
Dwight. ��You���re the vice president.
Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship.
And then we thought we���d ��� I can���t. I just can���t  carry on with that face. Look at it. I���m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he���s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ���Hello. Hi sweetie. It���s Jim. I���m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.���
Is It?
Oh, is it?
Yeah. I...
Whoo!
[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
Yeah
Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
I don't need anyone to-
Let's get Darryl Val.
Oh thank you so much!
Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And��� I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
Like I'm on the beach.
Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.
Get her out.
[Reading] ���She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.���
It's not..it's-
I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
Nope.
What is the delay here? Where���s Ryan? Why is he not here?
[laughs] Well, I have considered kidnapping one.
The quality of mercy is not strained.
I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
May I say one thing?
No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
Oh.
[laughing] It���s funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]
God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
But he���s flirting with Jim���s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.
What are the three pillars of retail?
Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies. [cheers, claps]
She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?
I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says ���Now Pants���] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.
Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn���t even get a callback.
Oh, yes, yes I see that! Perfect.
Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
���Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.���
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
No.
Five... four...
Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding.
No, no, no, not numbers, no.
Mmmm���the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I���m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
That���s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.
And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we���re going to be in so much trouble!
That is absolutely revolting!
[sighs]
Ah ha!
Let's go again. Five... four...
I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.
No. And I thought I unfriended you.
It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
Uh��� that is excellent.
I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
Ok, that's enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
Andy?
Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don���t you just have some more coffee?
And Filipino. But we���ll break that to her later.
Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
[hears knocks on door.] Come in!
Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
Well, they deserve each other, then.
Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
No no no no.
Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
Oh yes.
Do you think I���d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
Yeah.
Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You���re welcome, Andy. And you���re welcome, my own ass.
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
Oh, I don't care.
Creed, you are a thousand years old.
[speechless.] I...
���What we have���?
Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?
That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
Okay.
That's not even a thing.
Entrapment if I'm..
Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
Not necessarily
That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
Um.
The real Mose.
No.
Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%.  Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?
Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?
Dwight, our co-workers��� health issues are really none of our business so-
Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
Oh, well good for you. I mean, you���ll need a prescription.
[squealing]
Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
Why thank you.
I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ���I'm amazing.���
I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
Darryl is ���dating��� Dunder Mifflin.
well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? [Toby nods] One week? [Toby shakes head] Ok, two weeks? [Toby nods] Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
Yes!
[chuckles] What, then?
Ew. That���s not good.
Oh... Stanley?
Too weird.
You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?
Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
Angela, two hundred dollars!
Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
Impressive.
I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
You have to choose one now.
[whispers] Pam! [she pretends to slam a wrench over the tire service guy���s head].
Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'Yes!' So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?
You're the stupid one.
Okay, just calm down.
Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
No, you don't understand-
Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
Yes. I thought I���d you know, be you.
Yes. It is. Oh yes it is.
Brilliant!
He's doing it.
No...more...talking.
Let me just get the projector working.
I'm Tinkerbell.
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
[walks in] Oh.
Is it gonna be long?
No, I���m sorry but that is true.
Mmm.
I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.
Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.
Oh of course, you were adopted.
Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
mm-hmm���
Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. �����Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.��� I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
Oh man.
Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
And a wave crashing��� a wave crashing.
This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
Ah, what is your topic?
Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, ���looking for dirt.���
Oh.
Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
���A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.���
Hmm. Yeah. ��All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...
If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We���ll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won���t we?
Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!
No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful
Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I���m this patrician goddess. But here���s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ��� what���s lower than dirt?
Oh!
Stupid like you.
It���s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I���m not ashamed of that, But I���m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
Something wrong Dwight?
Yes?
Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
You.
I will be right back.
Oh, I don���t know. Okay.
I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
Oh God.
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
Oh come on, Andy!
Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
Yes!
..writing..
Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault.
Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
I will see you in seven-
That is for sure.
Oh, that is lovely.
$30, yes!
It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.
Psst. Say, 'I can't wait to meet him.'
That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
Thank you. I���m��� so stupid.
[to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
You are most welcome.
No.
Dwight, are you all right?
I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
aagh!
Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would���[hit in the face with trash]
[laughs mischievously] Yeeeeahhhh! It's almost unbelievable!
Good night Andy.
You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
Oh.
Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
Oh! Which public figure?
Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
Brilliant.
I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
Marriage counseling?
No.
Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars.
Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
Hmm? Oh���oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  I'm mean, I d���I just don't wanna���burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
It's not..it's not
Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
The mind is part of the body.
Mm-hmm.
Fine.
Pam, what is your address? I���m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don���t ���
Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?
Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
Well, it doesn't make you stupid.
Like you.
My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. [both laugh at Clark]
Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
I���m sexy Toby.
It���s just that I am taking my driver���s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to ���Demandy���...[Points to Andy's office with her thumb].  I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But���in who's car?
Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.
Oh, get out, skeleton man!
Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't 'a good fit-'
He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods]
No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
Shh.
Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
[Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
[Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
Dwight, you will be participating.
Mmm. [exits, Erin smiles deviously]
I���m very self-conscious about my feet.
Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
Oh, come on!
Well done, you two.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Well, I don't want any soup.
Well, this is getting us nowhere.
Absolutely not!
That one looks empty.
Well then if I could just convince...
How are you feeling?
Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
What?
[at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
Then you accept it?
Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I���m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can���t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
He doesn't even care.
The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.
[As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.
I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
The first 'sorry' sounded sincere.
I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?
I will.
[everyone groans] Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight.
Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.
Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  [hugs Pam]
Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
The pill is mine.
Whoo!
Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
Jim, time for your review.
Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
And the answer��� is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
They���re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
Loyalty is exactly right.
Oh.
Thank you, Andy.
Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?
Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
[Put her finger to his lips again] Shh.
Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight.
Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!
Three... two... one...
My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.
You don't need to-
Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.
Um, is this a good time?
No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.
Great, thank you.
No, let���s-- let���s-- let���s not say Creed. Let���s say Mr. X.
I got your voicemail. From ��� from last night.
I���m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let���s-- let���s use an example. Take Erin. Erin���s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
Hey Toby.
The way he just cuts off his arm.
When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
Mm-hm.
If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
That is amazing. Todd, look at that.
All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
Whhooooo!
Here���s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
Hmm, no.
Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!
Why are you sitting down like that?
I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Oooohh... you salty dog.
Ugh! I hate that! No offense.
Yeah, you���re right. This man needs to be apprehended.
Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
Hm?
I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.
He is so good, though.
We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
Wonderful, thanks.
You are gonna bloody ruin it. You���re gonna bloody ruin it because you���re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
I didn���t really think about it like that.
Jim, could you give us a hand?
You���ve just got me started. Robert��� is��� a filthy beast. I mean, don���t you get the feeling, he���s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Today, I launch my big charity initiative ���Operation Give Back���. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I���d like to see him piss on that one.
Can I see the wound?
Yes.
Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
Kevin, did you make that yourself?
How are things in the warehouse?
So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
I wasn���t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
Oh no.
Very good point.
