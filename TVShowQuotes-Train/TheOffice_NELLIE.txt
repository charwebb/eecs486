So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
[Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
We are now down to an elite eight.  Well, seven and Toby.
Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
Oh, it���s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let���s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
I���m having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let���s-- let���s use an example. Take Erin. Erin���s boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.
The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I���ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.
Oh, well good for you. I mean, you���ll need a prescription.
Here���s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
What is the delay here? Where���s Ryan? Why is he not here?
I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'Yes!' So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?
Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
You are gonna bloody ruin it. You���re gonna bloody ruin it because you���re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
And Filipino. But we���ll break that to her later.
For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!
Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies. [cheers, claps]
My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.
Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
Oh, thank you. I don���t know, I sort of thought--
Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don���t you just have some more coffee?
Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-
So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.
Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he���s a good man and that I hope he feels better.
I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says ���Now Pants���] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.
And then we thought we���d ��� I can���t. I just can���t  carry on with that face. Look at it. I���m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he���s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?
Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.
Mmmm���the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I���m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.
Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
The way he just cuts off his arm.
Okay, look Dwight, let���s just call this thing off. I mean, it���s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?
Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
No, let���s-- let���s-- let���s not say Creed. Let���s say Mr. X.
Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
What did I just say? What did I just say?
Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just��� you three, no.
Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
I got your voicemail. From ��� from last night.
Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will��� who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?
I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? [Toby nods] One week? [Toby shakes head] Ok, two weeks? [Toby nods] Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
Yeah, you���re right. This man needs to be apprehended.
Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%.  Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?
Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
They���re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we���re going to be in so much trouble!
Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
[Reading] ���She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.���
Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.
Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ���I'm amazing.���
You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't 'a good fit-'
You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
Ok, that's enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I���m this patrician goddess. But here���s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ��� what���s lower than dirt?
Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, ���looking for dirt.���
Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.
Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
Hmm? Oh���oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  I'm mean, I d���I just don't wanna���burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.
God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
[Put her finger to his lips again] Shh.
I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
���A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.���
And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.
Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
I wasn���t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
Yes! You! You are soo talented! It���s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton���s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.
If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We���ll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won���t we?
Psst. Say, 'I can't wait to meet him.'
Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And��� I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?
Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.
Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
[laughing] It���s funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]
Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
Psst. Say, 'So who's leading this thing, anyway?'
Oh. Oh, I���ll tell you what he does.
It���s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I���m not ashamed of that, But I���m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
The black one. I never stood a chance.
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship.
Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick [points to Pam]
It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
Oh, your mom���s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. ���Do Not Disturb��� sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
[Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would���[hit in the face with trash]
Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ���full-ass��� it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich.  Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim].
I didn���t really think about it like that.
God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?
Hmm. Yeah. ��All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...
Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.
Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It���s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
���Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.���
Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.
Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I���m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can���t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  [hugs Pam]
[quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?
Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
Yes. I thought I���d you know, be you.
You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?
Do you think I���d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. �����Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.��� I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
It���s just that I am taking my driver���s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to ���Demandy���...[Points to Andy's office with her thumb].  I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But���in who's car?
[at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget.
Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn���t even get a callback.
Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. [both laugh at Clark]
Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?
Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
[to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
[As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.
Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Today, I launch my big charity initiative ���Operation Give Back���. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I���d like to see him piss on that one.
Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?
She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
Dwight, our co-workers��� health issues are really none of our business so-
I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods]
So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
It's the apology. I really have to insist.
Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
And the answer��� is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
