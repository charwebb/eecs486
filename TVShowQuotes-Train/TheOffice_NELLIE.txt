I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Whhooooo!
I got your voicemail. From ��� from last night.
Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
Not necessarily
Whoo!
No.
Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?
[distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
���A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.���
No...more...talking.
Yes!
Uh��� that is excellent.
Mmm. [exits, Erin smiles deviously]
[chuckles] What, then?
Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
So far, so good.
Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
[laughing] It���s funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]
No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! [whispers] I love it.
It's not..it's not
Angela advances.
Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?
Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual.
Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
And the answer��� is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't 'a good fit-'
Well then if I could just convince...
Quite enormous.
Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
[nail stylist 2 giggles] What?
Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It���s for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
I wasn���t really sure which one of you is Chuck.
Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
How did that look?
Oh.
The mind is part of the body.
Ah, what is your topic?
Oh thank you so much!
No no no no.
There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?
What did I just say? What did I just say?
Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
Oh, good lord.
So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?
Then you accept it?
Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
Ah ha!
Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.
mm-hmm���
Performance reviews.
How are things in the warehouse?
Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
The first 'sorry' sounded sincere.
Dwight, what about you?
[sighs]. How can you be sure?
$30, yes!
Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
Jim, could you give us a hand?
Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
Entrapment if I'm..
[to Darryl] You know what this is all about.
Oh, it���s nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?
Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars.
Darryl is ���dating��� Dunder Mifflin.
Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will��� who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
What?
Kevin, did you make that yourself?
All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would���[hit in the face with trash]
Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ���full-ass��� it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. [pauses] I just made a joke there.
[sighs]
Wonderful, thanks.
Um, is this a good time?
Mm-hmm.
What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Hmm. Yeah. ��All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...
[As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
Oh.
Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-
Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?
Three...
Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let���s all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
Alright then.
Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
But he���s flirting with Jim���s company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.
May I say one thing?
Oh, god, Pam. Don���t get me started.
No. And I thought I unfriended you.
No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
Well done, you two.
Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
You're the stupid one.
Absolutely not!
What should we say about Jim?
Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.
We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?
Well, I don't want any soup.
Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
Allow me to solve your problem, then.
Yes! You! You are soo talented! It���s going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton���s most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
Thank you. I���m��� so stupid.
Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
[speechless.] I...
Fine.
Yes.
Oooohh... you salty dog.
What is the delay here? Where���s Ryan? Why is he not here?
[to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
Oh, you signed it?
Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.
Today, I launch my big charity initiative ���Operation Give Back���. Andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I���d like to see him piss on that one.
You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?
Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.
Oh no.
And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
Oh... Stanley?
Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
The real Mose.
You're the stupid one.
Angela, two hundred dollars!
Nope.
God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
The black one. I never stood a chance.
So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.
I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%.  Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?
Have you seen Darryl?
Oh. Oh, I���ll tell you what he does.
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
Is it gonna be long?
Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
Mm.
That's not even a thing.
How you doing?
Let's go again. Five... four...
Yes!
He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods]
Oh, your mom���s watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. ���Do Not Disturb��� sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
aagh!
Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
That was exhausting.
Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
Is It?
Why are you sitting down like that?
Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
Good night Andy.
I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: ���I'm amazing.���
I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Darryl, looking good!
We are now down to an elite eight.  Well, seven and Toby.
Mmm.
I don't need anyone to-
Wow.
Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.
I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
Yes. I thought I���d you know, be you.
You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
Whoo!
I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
Okay, just calm down.
Do you think I���d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Andy?
[Reading] ���She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents.���
He's doing it.
Oh, gosh.
Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
You are gonna bloody ruin it. You���re gonna bloody ruin it because you���re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
Marriage counseling?
Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight.
The way he just cuts off his arm.
Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
Creed, you are a thousand years old.
Here���s an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
No, no, no, not numbers, no.
Well, Angela is the winner.
[hears knocks on door.] Come in!
I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
Stupid like you.
For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!
Shh. [Puts her finger to Toby's lips]
Oh man.
Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
Yeah, you���re right. This man needs to be apprehended.
Something wrong Dwight?
[walks in] Oh.
Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!  [hugs Pam]
Psst. Say, 'I can't wait to meet him.'
Oh yes.
Robert.
Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, 'Yes!' So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?
Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says ���Now Pants���] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.
You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. [both laugh at Clark]
How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Absolutely not. Seven percent.
Oh.
Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace.
Dwight told me about it earlier.
I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
Oh.
Oh!
I will.
A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
[Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
[at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
You.
Shh.
Very good point.
No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?
Yes?
By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
I���m very self-conscious about my feet.
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding.
I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
[to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I���ve commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking  color schemes and the major themes we want to hit.  Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper.  But not in a child labor-y way.
I will be right back.
In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.
So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!
Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
Are you insulting my guests?
If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
Hmm? Oh���oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine.  I'm mean, I d���I just don't wanna���burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We���ll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won���t we?
Next up we have Dwight and Phyllis.
Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You���re welcome, Andy. And you���re welcome, my own ass.
Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget.
No, you don't understand-
Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.
I didn���t really think about it like that.
Oh, that is lovely.
No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. �����Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously.��� I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
[Put her finger to his lips again] Shh.
Pam, what is your address? I���m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don���t ���
Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
Dwight. ��You���re the vice president.
A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I���ve tried so far is Alpine Select!
Oh, yes, yes I see that! Perfect.
Mmmm���the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I���m driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
Oh come on, Andy!
Hey Toby.
Or what's her name.
Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
Thank you, Andy.
He is so good, though.
It���s just that I am taking my driver���s license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to ���Demandy���...[Points to Andy's office with her thumb].  I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But���in who's car?
Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
Well, it doesn't make you stupid.
Okay.
No.
Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn���t even get a callback.
Yeah
That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
You���ve just got me started. Robert��� is��� a filthy beast. I mean, don���t you get the feeling, he���s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Oh, why, is there something?
No.
Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship.
We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? ���Hello. Hi sweetie. It���s Jim. I���m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.���
Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
���In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There���s Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.���
Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
What do you mean?
Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
No.
Psst. Say, 'So who's leading this thing, anyway?'
Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don���t you just have some more coffee?
No.
well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? [Toby nods] One week? [Toby shakes head] Ok, two weeks? [Toby nods] Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
Brilliant.
No, let���s-- let���s-- let���s not say Creed. Let���s say Mr. X.
That is absolutely revolting!
So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
Yeah.
Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.
We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
Oh, come on!
Andy.
Hmm, no.
[considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
[misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!
Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I���m this patrician goddess. But here���s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ��� what���s lower than dirt?
Blow in my ear.
[laughs] Well, I have considered kidnapping one.
I'm Tinkerbell.
Ok, that's enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
Ugh! I hate that! No offense.
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
It's the apology. I really have to insist.
It���s my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I���m not ashamed of that, But I���m not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
That is amazing. Todd, look at that.
How are you feeling?
Dwight, you will be participating.
And Filipino. But we���ll break that to her later.
What?
What are the three pillars of retail?
And then we thought we���d ��� I can���t. I just can���t  carry on with that face. Look at it. I���m gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he���s laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
That���s amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
Hm?
Oh, well good for you. I mean, you���ll need a prescription.
I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
Oh! Which public figure?
I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.
No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
Andy.
Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
..writing..
Let me just get the projector working.
No.
I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
That is for sure.
Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, ���looking for dirt.���
They���re freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? [knocks] [Dwight turns off the lights] Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? [knocks] Dwight? [whispers] Dwight. [Dwight eats his Bananas Foster]
Dwight, our co-workers��� health issues are really none of our business so-
I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
[As trash is thrown at her] Fluke.
Too weird.
Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
Loyalty is exactly right.
I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.
Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
Yes, Robert!
You have to choose one now.
And a wave crashing��� a wave crashing.
Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just��� you three, no.
For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich.  Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim].
Oh, thank you. I don���t know, I sort of thought--
Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies]
You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
You are most welcome.
Get her out.
Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
Um.
Oh, get out, skeleton man!
Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
[to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies. [cheers, claps]
[Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this?
Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
Mm-hm.
Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
[Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
Oh, is it?
Like you.
I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
Were they angry?
[holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
Yes. It is. Oh yes it is.
Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
No.
Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
���What we have���?
On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
The pill is mine.
Oh!
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick [points to Pam]
Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Three... two... one...
She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
Okay, look Dwight, let���s just call this thing off. I mean, it���s just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
I am in too, Pam.
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he���s a good man and that I hope he feels better.
Well, they deserve each other, then.
Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
Great, thank you.
So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
Why thank you.
I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
Mm-hmm.
But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
No, I���m sorry but that is true.
I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
Oh, please don't use the hourglass.
Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful
I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
Whoo!
Ew. That���s not good.
Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And��� I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault.
Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.
Impressive.
Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
Let's get Darryl Val.
I'm trying to adopt a baby.
Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Like I'm on the beach.
Five... four...
Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
It's not..it's-
Brilliant!
You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
Can I see the wound?
It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
Dwight, are you all right?
And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we���re going to be in so much trouble!
Do you want to go again?
