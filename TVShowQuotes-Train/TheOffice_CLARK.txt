Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
You know what, man? I deserve this job.
All I���m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager���s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where���s the band? ���Cause there���s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then��� Killed those kids on their way to prom!
A gentleman doesn���t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
There���s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And���and Wallace is here today. And I don���t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.
It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
Dude, this size of my haunches��� [Stanley���s body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]
[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?
I don't want to teach you Power Point.
[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but��� God I missed you!
Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.
I���ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
Thanks, dude. You���you sure it���s okay? ���Cause you���re kinda���
Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together.
Do what? Get into sales? That���s what I want.
I think I���m busy that night. Or I would.
[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is��� our relationship is��� terr-
No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.
Great, now we got three hours to fill.
That���s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete���s beautiful, dead eyes.
All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.
Is this���is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that���s totally fine. Like, I���m fine with it. But you should know that I���m into the ladies.
Oh, I���m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh?
Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?
Okay. We, hey���hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond��� and under.
I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
Well, that���s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
We can���t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.
You know, if you���re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
[looking down at Erin���s desk] Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election��� thing is crazy, right?
Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave]
Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
This interview���s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru���d the whole process.
[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
Hey, so I hear you���re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.
Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad���s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That���s why his face always breaks out.
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
If it���ll lead to me being a salesman, I���ll pretend to be your friend.
I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue.
Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It���s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so��� bon appetite.
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
[emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.
OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?
Dwight, for the last time, she���s not a waitress.
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
So if you look at our catalog here���
God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
So how���d you guys hear about the position?
So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
Well, you're doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.
Hey, Pam, I���m going to the kitchen. You want anything?
Isn���t the client, like, best friends with his sister?
Hey, wait, wait, how���how are we doing this?
Yeah, it's quite full.  Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
Just say ���arms��� and ���legs,��� okay? That just���that���s the vernacular that I���m comfortable with.
He calls me Clarky ���cause he���s my Dad.
It doesn't...  Why don't you bring your baby over here...  She's beautiful.
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I���m going to need one right? If I���m ever going to get a ���real job��� and move my ���lazy ass��� out of your ���G.D. house���.
You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won...
You just let it all hang out, that's what...
[Playing computer game with Toby] You���re looking good.
Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.���
Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
I don't even know what an auger is!
Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven���t had time to pursue yet?
[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?
I can���t catch him. He���s like, 250 pounds.
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren���t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
Alright, that���s enough, ���cause I can say some things about him too.
God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he���s like a serial killer��� of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]
You got this, it���s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It���s not a race, Dwight.
They got us set up with Windows 95, ��so you���re kind of dreaming here.
Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with.
