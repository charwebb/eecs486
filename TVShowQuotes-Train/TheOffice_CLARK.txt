Congrats, Dwight.
I can���t catch him. He���s like, 250 pounds.
Just do the tutorial.
Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?
Hey, Pam, I���m going to the kitchen. You want anything?
Hey guys.
What lines?
I think I���m busy that night. Or I would.
No.
And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
Yeah, I���ll just give it a glance���
What's her name?
Kay. [removes glasses]
Quater finals in an hour.  Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
We can���t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It���s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so��� bon appetite.
Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
Oooohhhhhhhh!
Oh, wide wings, interesting.
[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?
Yeah, it's quite full.  Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
Right. Yeah. But, you know, I���ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I���ve earned this. I mean, you know?
Alright, let���s see you do it.
So how���d you guys hear about the position?
Well, you know, I���m also Customer Service.
What���s with the wig Meredith?
There he is.
Come back.
Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.
I don't even know what an auger is!
No, we sure hadn���t Pop. [both chuckling]
Sweet.
Stimulate it.
I was thinking about���
Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then��� Killed those kids on their way to prom!
Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
Hey, so I hear you���re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
That���s a little weird.
I���ll give it a read.
Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
Well, if I may, you���re a natural.
What?
Ok
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And���and Wallace is here today. And I don���t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
Perfect height, yeah.
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
Hi, I���m Clark.
My mistake.
Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga! [laughs]
My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he���s like a serial killer��� of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]
Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.
Okay.
He calls me Clarky ���cause he���s my Dad.
Packer laced the cupcakes.
Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
The same thing that you think.
That���s just a classic no-win situation.
Is this���is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that���s totally fine. Like, I���m fine with it. But you should know that I���m into the ladies.
This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
Yep, body by Cheez-it
Thanks, dude.
Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
So if you look at our catalog here���
I don���t either.
Yeah.
So Pete was a librarian?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You just let it all hang out, that's what...
Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.
Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?
Why?
I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
Damn it.
Well, uh��� see, you raised it.
Did you? [pushes pencil cup at Erin]
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
God!
���And I love you, for saying that.
That���s how you do that! Whoo!
Hey, Dwight.
Oh.
Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.���
I don't want to teach you Power Point.
Women don���t despise me���
What���s up good lookin���?
You know, if you���re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
All right.
[Playing computer game with Toby] You���re looking good.
What?
Do what? Get into sales? That���s what I want.
Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless.
Alright, that���s enough, ���cause I can say some things about him too.
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond��� and under.
So Creed is that dude's step dad?
Just clap through it, man.
No!
These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
Why?
Okay.  Let me feel here.
X-Men school?
I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad���s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That���s why his face always breaks out.
Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.
Yeah.
Come on in.
Kay.
I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue.
Here we go!
Dwight, for the last time, she���s not a waitress.
It doesn't...  Why don't you bring your baby over here...  She's beautiful.
Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
I am!
I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
One second.
I do. I love the boss���s interests.
When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?
I���ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.
Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
All right.
Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was��� like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh��� like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
[to Pam] Who's this guy?
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
Holy [bleep].
Blunt?
Think it over. [punches Pete]
If it���ll lead to me being a salesman, I���ll pretend to be your friend.
Hey, how was the singing show audition?
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but��� God I missed you!
Well, I wouldn���t be so sure about that. I mean, I���ve been working here 12 weeks. That���s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we���ve seen.
Great, now we got three hours to fill.
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren���t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
[emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?
Well, I understand, but ���
They got us set up with Windows 95, ��so you���re kind of dreaming here.
Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
Learning what?
Well, you're doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
All I���m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager���s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
You didn't actually say that.
Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave]
She's living a lie.
I absolutely will do that.
Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
Was he like the sexy librarian?
One second.
I love it.
Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.
And then what?
We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
It's a medical thing.
You know what, man? I deserve this job.
Okay. We, hey���hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
This interview���s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru���d the whole process.
But I fought for this seat.
You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I���m going to need one right? If I���m ever going to get a ���real job��� and move my ���lazy ass��� out of your ���G.D. house���.
[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?
No, I prefer Fart.
Yes, congratulations.
You gave him three shots.
Yep.
Yeah, good nose.
[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is��� our relationship is��� terr-
Isn���t the client, like, best friends with his sister?
I'll get that for you.
I would love a corn dog.
Aw, come on.
That���s actually really smart.
So I���d Kobayashi Maru it.
Wha���What���s a shank?
Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.
Ok.
Right. Well, I���m here to sell paper.
Dude, this size of my haunches��� [Stanley���s body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]
Mmm.
Oh, I���m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.
Just say ���arms��� and ���legs,��� okay? That just���that���s the vernacular that I���m comfortable with.
I am.
Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together.
[exhales]
Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where���s the band? ���Cause there���s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
[to Pete] What're you doing here?
Well, that���s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
A gentleman doesn���t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
Driving.
Yeah���yup yup.
You opened the door-
Yep, she's done.
No, we got it. We got it.
Thanks, dude. You���you sure it���s okay? ���Cause you���re kinda���
Oh, Dove Men.
[connect helmet straps around Stanley���s head] That���s about as good as that���s gonna be.
Wintergreen.
OK, I don't.
This is never gonna work.
Hmm.
Don't do it. [takes Dwight's pen]
What, am I overdoing it? No. No.
[sarcastically chuckling] I loved it.
Uh, I don���t know yet.
Terrible.
That���s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete���s beautiful, dead eyes.
[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
Stretch. Alright.
Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for?
So you guys all know Dwight already?
Dude, we're being conned.
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven���t had time to pursue yet?
There���s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won...
Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
[Pete looks on disappointed] Ok.
There you go, good for you.
Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.
