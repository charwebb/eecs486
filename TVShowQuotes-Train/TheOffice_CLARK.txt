I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven���t had time to pursue yet?
We can���t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
Hey, wait, wait, how���how are we doing this?
Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
He calls me Clarky ���cause he���s my Dad.
There���s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
Do what? Get into sales? That���s what I want.
Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together.
Great, now we got three hours to fill.
Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was��� like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh��� like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
[Playing computer game with Toby] You���re looking good.
Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
Hey, so I hear you���re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
So how���d you guys hear about the position?
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.
So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
If it���ll lead to me being a salesman, I���ll pretend to be your friend.
I���ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
So if you look at our catalog here���
They got us set up with Windows 95, ��so you���re kind of dreaming here.
It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave]
All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And���and Wallace is here today. And I don���t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.
I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.
[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.
These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
Isn���t the client, like, best friends with his sister?
We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
I think I���m busy that night. Or I would.
Hey, Pam, I���m going to the kitchen. You want anything?
Right. Yeah. But, you know, I���ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I���ve earned this. I mean, you know?
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
Thanks, dude. You���you sure it���s okay? ���Cause you���re kinda���
Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless.
I don't want to teach you Power Point.
This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
[emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.
Just say ���arms��� and ���legs,��� okay? That just���that���s the vernacular that I���m comfortable with.
Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where���s the band? ���Cause there���s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
You know, if you���re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then��� Killed those kids on their way to prom!
You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh?
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren���t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
[looking down at Erin���s desk] Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election��� thing is crazy, right?
Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
Is this���is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that���s totally fine. Like, I���m fine with it. But you should know that I���m into the ladies.
Alright, that���s enough, ���cause I can say some things about him too.
Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?
Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
Yeah, it's quite full.  Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.
Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
Well, I wouldn���t be so sure about that. I mean, I���ve been working here 12 weeks. That���s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we���ve seen.
[connect helmet straps around Stanley���s head] That���s about as good as that���s gonna be.
And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
Oh, I���m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
You know what, man? I deserve this job.
Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond��� and under.
Dude, this size of my haunches��� [Stanley���s body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]
Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but��� God I missed you!
Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.
A gentleman doesn���t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
This interview���s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru���d the whole process.
No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It���s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so��� bon appetite.
[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?
It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
Well, you're doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
It doesn't...  Why don't you bring your baby over here...  She's beautiful.
[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won...
Quater finals in an hour.  Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.���
Okay. We, hey���hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
[emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?
I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad���s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That���s why his face always breaks out.
Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with.
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.
Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
You got this, it���s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It���s not a race, Dwight.
Well, that���s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
I don't even know what an auger is!
Dwight, for the last time, she���s not a waitress.
You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I���m going to need one right? If I���m ever going to get a ���real job��� and move my ���lazy ass��� out of your ���G.D. house���.
That���s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete���s beautiful, dead eyes.
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
