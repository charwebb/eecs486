Blunt?
That���s a little weird.
It's porn.
She's living a lie.
Think it over. [punches Pete]
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
Hey, Pam, I���m going to the kitchen. You want anything?
Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
You didn't actually say that.
What���s with the wig Meredith?
Well, uh��� see, you raised it.
Yeah. Star Trek rules.
Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
You gave him three shots.
Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.
Thanks, dude. You���you sure it���s okay? ���Cause you���re kinda���
God!
Come back.
[sighs]
No.
Well, you know, I���m also Customer Service.
He calls me Clarky ���cause he���s my Dad.
You know what, Dwight?
Okay.  Let me feel here.
Oh, I���m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
Right. Well, I���m here to sell paper.
I'll get that for you.
Well, I wouldn���t be so sure about that. I mean, I���ve been working here 12 weeks. That���s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we���ve seen.
That���s how you do that! Whoo!
Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven���t had time to pursue yet?
Any good weekend plans?
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
Alright, let���s see you do it.
You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I���m going to need one right? If I���m ever going to get a ���real job��� and move my ���lazy ass��� out of your ���G.D. house���.
Well, if I may, you���re a natural.
I love it.
I���ll give it a read.
OK, I don't.
No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
Catch?
[emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.
Stimulate it.
Did you? [pushes pencil cup at Erin]
If it���ll lead to me being a salesman, I���ll pretend to be your friend.
Learning what?
Holy [bleep].
So how���d you guys hear about the position?
This interview���s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru���d the whole process.
There you go, good for you.
Mm-mm.
All I���m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager���s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
But I fought for this seat.
So you guys all know Dwight already?
Wha���What���s a shank?
All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And���and Wallace is here today. And I don���t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
I can���t catch him. He���s like, 250 pounds.
We can���t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
Alright, that���s enough, ���cause I can say some things about him too.
Do what? Get into sales? That���s what I want.
Ok
Right. Yeah. But, you know, I���ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I���ve earned this. I mean, you know?
No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.
So I���d Kobayashi Maru it.
Was he like the sexy librarian?
Thanks, dude.
I would love a corn dog.
Damn it.
[sarcastically chuckling] I loved it.
Packer laced the cupcakes.
Quater finals in an hour.  Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
So if you look at our catalog here���
Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.
Well, that���s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.
Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was��� like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh��� like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
Where���s the Quizno���s?
Just do the tutorial.
Yeah���yup yup.
Sweet.
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad���s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That���s why his face always breaks out.
What?
What���s up good lookin���?
This is never gonna work.
Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
Okay. We, hey���hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
Yes! All right!
Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for?
Isn���t the client, like, best friends with his sister?
You know, if you���re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue.
Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is��� our relationship is��� terr-
[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?
Hey, how was the singing show audition?
What, am I overdoing it? No. No.
I don't even know what an auger is!
Yep, body by Cheez-it
Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.
[connect helmet straps around Stanley���s head] That���s about as good as that���s gonna be.
No, we sure hadn���t Pop. [both chuckling]
Kay. [removes glasses]
Yeah, good nose.
OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
I don���t either.
Here we go!
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
Kay.
Dude, this size of my haunches��� [Stanley���s body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]
Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.
All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.
That���s just a classic no-win situation.
Oh.
There���s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
I do. I love the boss���s interests.
Nice.
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then��� Killed those kids on their way to prom!
Hey, so I hear you���re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
Yes, congratulations.
Hey, wait, wait, how���how are we doing this?
Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
You just let it all hang out, that's what...
That���s actually really smart.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?
And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
���And I love you, for saying that.
Hey, Dwight.
[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.���
Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won...
I am!
So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
Perfect height, yeah.
Oh, wide wings, interesting.
My mistake.
Mmm.
We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
[Playing computer game with Toby] You���re looking good.
I am.
These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
Don't do it. [takes Dwight's pen]
It doesn't...  Why don't you bring your baby over here...  She's beautiful.
This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
Okay.
[exhales]
Stretch. Alright.
Yeah, it's quite full.  Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond��� and under.
Oooohhhhhhhh!
Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga! [laughs]
Great, now we got three hours to fill.
Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
So Pete was a librarian?
Terrible.
Is this���is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that���s totally fine. Like, I���m fine with it. But you should know that I���m into the ladies.
No, we got it. We got it.
The same thing that you think.
One second.
[to Pam] Who's this guy?
So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.
I absolutely will do that.
They got us set up with Windows 95, ��so you���re kind of dreaming here.
What?
A gentleman doesn���t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?
Why?
Congrats, Dwight.
Yeah, I���ll just give it a glance���
It's a medical thing.
I don't want to teach you Power Point.
Let���s talk.
[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
What's her name?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless.
I was thinking about���
And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
All right.
That���s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete���s beautiful, dead eyes.
Yep.
Just clap through it, man.
[emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?
My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he���s like a serial killer��� of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]
God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
Dwight, for the last time, she���s not a waitress.
Well, I understand, but ���
Come on in.
So Creed is that dude's step dad?
There he is.
Uh, I don���t know yet.
One second.
Driving.
What lines?
[looking down at Erin���s desk] Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election��� thing is crazy, right?
We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
[to Pete] What're you doing here?
Hey guys.
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren���t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
Women don���t despise me���
Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It���s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so��� bon appetite.
[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but��� God I missed you!
I think I���m busy that night. Or I would.
No!
Why?
It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave]
Hi, I���m Clark.
God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
Just say ���arms��� and ���legs,��� okay? That just���that���s the vernacular that I���m comfortable with.
Well, you're doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
[Pete looks on disappointed] Ok.
X-Men school?
No, I prefer Fart.
Aw, come on.
[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
Yep, she's done.
I���ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
