It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless.
Well, that���s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?
Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
Hey, wait, wait, how���how are we doing this?
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
Yeah, it's quite full.  Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.
Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where���s the band? ���Cause there���s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
If it���ll lead to me being a salesman, I���ll pretend to be your friend.
Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?
Dwight, for the last time, she���s not a waitress.
It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave]
So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
He calls me Clarky ���cause he���s my Dad.
You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won...
All I���m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager���s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then��� Killed those kids on their way to prom!
I don't even know what an auger is!
Right. Yeah. But, you know, I���ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I���ve earned this. I mean, you know?
[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.
Great, now we got three hours to fill.
Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
Well, I wouldn���t be so sure about that. I mean, I���ve been working here 12 weeks. That���s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we���ve seen.
[emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?
No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.
You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh?
I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad���s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That���s why his face always breaks out.
Okay. We, hey���hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
Quater finals in an hour.  Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
[Playing computer game with Toby] You���re looking good.
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
Thanks, dude. You���you sure it���s okay? ���Cause you���re kinda���
We can���t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
Oh, I���m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
There���s obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
You know, if you���re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
You just let it all hang out, that's what...
Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
You got this, it���s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It���s not a race, Dwight.
[emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.
I���ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?
Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.
They got us set up with Windows 95, ��so you���re kind of dreaming here.
I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue.
Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together.
Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.
Isn���t the client, like, best friends with his sister?
Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with.
I don't want to teach you Power Point.
My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he���s like a serial killer��� of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]
Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
It doesn't...  Why don't you bring your baby over here...  She's beautiful.
All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.
This interview���s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru���d the whole process.
Hey, Pam, I���m going to the kitchen. You want anything?
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
A gentleman doesn���t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven���t had time to pursue yet?
So if you look at our catalog here���
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren���t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
Just say ���arms��� and ���legs,��� okay? That just���that���s the vernacular that I���m comfortable with.
[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is��� our relationship is��� terr-
[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.���
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was��� like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh��� like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It���s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so��� bon appetite.
Do what? Get into sales? That���s what I want.
And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
I can���t catch him. He���s like, 250 pounds.
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond��� and under.
Well, you're doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?
Alright, that���s enough, ���cause I can say some things about him too.
[connect helmet straps around Stanley���s head] That���s about as good as that���s gonna be.
I think I���m busy that night. Or I would.
When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.
Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?
You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I���m going to need one right? If I���m ever going to get a ���real job��� and move my ���lazy ass��� out of your ���G.D. house���.
Hey, so I hear you���re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but��� God I missed you!
This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And���and Wallace is here today. And I don���t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.
So how���d you guys hear about the position?
So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.
