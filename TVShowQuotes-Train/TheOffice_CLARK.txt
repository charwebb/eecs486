[to Pam] Who's this guy?
Okay.
God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
[Playing computer game with Toby] You���re looking good.
No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.
One second.
When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
Any good weekend plans?
Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga! [laughs]
What's her name?
Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
Packer laced the cupcakes.
Yeah, good nose.
Damn it.
God!
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven���t had time to pursue yet?
Hmm.
I do. I love the boss���s interests.
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
What?
[sarcastically chuckling] I loved it.
Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was��� like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh��� like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
Just say ���arms��� and ���legs,��� okay? That just���that���s the vernacular that I���m comfortable with.
That���s actually really smart.
Just do the tutorial.
Oh, Dove Men.
Yep.
A gentleman doesn���t discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
[Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
He calls me Clarky ���cause he���s my Dad.
[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too?
No, I prefer Fart.
These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
So you guys all know Dwight already?
Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?
Yeah, it's quite full.  Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue.
He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.
The same thing that you think.
Dude, we're being conned.
What lines?
You just let it all hang out, that's what...
Dwight, for the last time, she���s not a waitress.
Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.
Hey, Pam, I���m going to the kitchen. You want anything?
And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
I am!
Is this���is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that���s totally fine. Like, I���m fine with it. But you should know that I���m into the ladies.
Stretch. Alright.
Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where���s the band? ���Cause there���s just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
So Pete was a librarian?
You didn't actually say that.
It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave]
We can���t just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
Holy [bleep].
You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I���m going to need one right? If I���m ever going to get a ���real job��� and move my ���lazy ass��� out of your ���G.D. house���.
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
I don���t either.
That���s a little weird.
What���s with the wig Meredith?
No!
Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
Why?
Hi, I���m Clark.
Uh... couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
Kay.
Well, you know, I���m also Customer Service.
Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
Well, I understand, but ���
We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
Why?
Was he like the sexy librarian?
That���s how you do that! Whoo!
So Creed is that dude's step dad?
One second.
I love it.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
X-Men school?
It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
You gave him three shots.
Okay. We, hey���hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
What?
This is never gonna work.
OK, boss. [quietly] Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
Quater finals in an hour.  Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
Come on in.
I can���t catch him. He���s like, 250 pounds.
Thanks, dude.
Oh, wide wings, interesting.
Yep, body by Cheez-it
I���ll give it a read.
So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
Oh, I���m sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
Hey, wait, wait, how���how are we doing this?
So if you look at our catalog here���
Nice.
Just clap through it, man.
Alright, that���s enough, ���cause I can say some things about him too.
All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.
Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.
Isn���t the client, like, best friends with his sister?
Ok
Thanks, dude. You���you sure it���s okay? ���Cause you���re kinda���
Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
I���ve always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits.
Let���s talk.
You know, if you���re ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
Yeah, I���ll just give it a glance���
It's porn.
So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.
So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
I would love a corn dog.
You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
Catch?
Did you? [pushes pencil cup at Erin]
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
Mmm.
Great, now we got three hours to fill.
This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
Well, you're doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
Learning what?
Come back.
���And I love you, for saying that.
I'm good. I..
Right. Yeah. But, you know, I���ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I���ve earned this. I mean, you know?
I absolutely will do that.
[answers his door to find Erin, Andy and Pete] Hey! Everybody.
But I fought for this seat.
Right. Well, I���m here to sell paper.
All I���m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager���s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
Where���s the Quizno���s?
Hey, so I hear you���re bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
Perfect height, yeah.
Alright, let���s see you do it.
There he is.
Okay.  Let me feel here.
Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for?
Oh.
This interview���s over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru���d the whole process.
I'll get that for you.
Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?
No, we sure hadn���t Pop. [both chuckling]
Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
Hey, Dwight.
No.
I think I���m busy that night. Or I would.
Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It���s an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so��� bon appetite.
[emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?
[sighs]
[Pete looks on disappointed] Ok.
[reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.���
Oooohhhhhhhh!
No, we got it. We got it.
It doesn't...  Why don't you bring your baby over here...  She's beautiful.
Well, I wouldn���t be so sure about that. I mean, I���ve been working here 12 weeks. That���s a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we���ve seen.
I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad���s suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That���s why his face always breaks out.
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then��� Killed those kids on their way to prom!
My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he���s like a serial killer��� of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]
All right.
Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.
Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
[looking down at Erin���s desk] Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election��� thing is crazy, right?
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond��� and under.
Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
[whispering to Pete] Whatever it takes.
That���s just a classic no-win situation.
You got this, it���s all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It���s not a race, Dwight.
Terrible.
All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And���and Wallace is here today. And I don���t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
Blunt?
They're tasteful.
So I���d Kobayashi Maru it.
Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.
Ok.
You know what, man? I deserve this job.
It's a medical thing.
Stimulate it.
Well, that���s better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
Congrats, Dwight.
I was thinking about���
We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?
Kay. [removes glasses]
Yeah.
You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh?
Women don���t despise me���
Wha���What���s a shank?
They got us set up with Windows 95, ��so you���re kind of dreaming here.
Well, if I may, you���re a natural.
You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won...
No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless.
[enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but��� God I missed you!
I don't want to teach you Power Point.
She's living a lie.
Wintergreen.
[catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is��� our relationship is��� terr-
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren���t those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
That���s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete���s beautiful, dead eyes.
I don't even know what an auger is!
All right.
What���s up good lookin���?
Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together.
Yeah���yup yup.
There you go, good for you.
God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
Yep, she's done.
Hey guys.
[to Pete] What're you doing here?
[confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
Do what? Get into sales? That���s what I want.
Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
Yes! All right!
Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
Here we go!
Mm-mm.
[talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?
Sweet.
[connect helmet straps around Stanley���s head] That���s about as good as that���s gonna be.
And then what?
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
Come in.
