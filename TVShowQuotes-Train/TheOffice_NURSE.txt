Oh good, because my next question was 'do you have a game to get back to.'
Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant...
What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.
Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
Yeah, she'll be fine.  I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.
I don't know what that means. We're gonna circumcise him.
To be safe, we should do an x-ray.
Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.
Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while.  I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
She can.  But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest.  You've been through a lot.
Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?
Bottles are fine.  A lot of babies grow up using bottles.  So are you excited to bring your baby home?
Twenty five minutes.  And you're all set with the car seat?
That bottom part needs to go in the car.
