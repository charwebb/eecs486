Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant...

She can.  But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest.  You've been through a lot.
Hey, guys.  We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.
Yeah, she'll be fine.  I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.

Twenty five minutes.  And you're all set with the car seat?
Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while.  I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.
Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?
Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.
Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
Oh good, because my next question was 'do you have a game to get back to.'
