I want to give you a big cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me.
Finally, the triangle is mine! After centuries of waiting, I finally have the triangle of Zinthar! Now, the Diamond of Pantheos is complete  Sugoi! Kono ima... atarashii hajimari da! Ima kara... atashi no na mae wa... (Wow! This is... a new beginning! From now on... my name will be...) 
That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person.  I hear that one of you found my triangle.
A cop showed up - he's a clever one - I can't blow everything now that I'm this close. Everything must be handled very carefully.  How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand! 
You fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! I'll teach you to meddle with my triangle! 
Alright. You asked for it!I'm gonna tell you now... 
He has it, Milo. That little bastard has the triangle.
I'm sure! He knew about the symbol of Krewluck!
Ugh. Look. Little boy, I understand that you found a neat little triangle near here, you know what I'm talking about?
Well, little boy, does the triangle have a symbol of two snakes joined at the middle?
Who is the boy I saw on the news report tonight?  Hello there, little boy. Do you know who I am?
So?! Uh muh, so I'm a very famous and vey important individual.
Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours.
Problemo? Huh, There's no problemo, Officer. I was just introducing myself to these charming little boys.
Eh. Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will be mine, and I will be the biggest, most famous person ever!
Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today?
Okay, now this is very important. Where is the triangle of Zinthar now?
I'm not talking to you, you piss-ant little hick!
