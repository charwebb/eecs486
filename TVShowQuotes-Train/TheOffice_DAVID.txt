Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...
Good work.
Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.
Uh, hey, I'm sorry.  I'm taking this out on you.
In the middle of a work day?
I don't know. I mean, what can you do?
Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.
Yes, as we've discussed-
Hmm.
Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  You've given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak.
Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh.
No. No dogs.
Thanks, Michael.
No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?
[opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.
What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.
Thank you for coming.
Herrow! Herrow!
Oh.  Yes.  Very good.
Yes.
Uh.
It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.
I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
Okay, I will look at it Monday.
This is a very very bad time.
Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier.
Is this why you're calling me?
Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
Yeah.
Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.
Am I missing something?
So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
Yeah!
God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
Okay.
Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li [bleep].  That's what it sounds like.
This is off the record.
Hmmm.
Pam's not a salesperson.
Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
I'll be fired.
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It���s someone new but she didn���t catch her name.
You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
Nice to meet you.
And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
Okay, I have to go.
Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
Um��� I���m in the middle of a piano lesson.
No.
...that's a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads 'Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous!  Pam'  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up...
Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
How did you get here, Michael?
I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?
Yes.
How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]
I do.
I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know.
But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well... You know what?  I'm sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?
Shh.
Please do.
Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?
You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
Hey Sweetie, what is it?
I find that extraordinarily surprising.
Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.
Yes.
...what do you think about Michael Scott?
Stephanie, can you hop off please?
Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it.
I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.
[on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I'm so glad.  We're all very excited you're going to be joining us.  It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.
Keep it up, son.
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
No, ah it's okay Michael.  We got it.
Okay.
Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in.
Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]
Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.
Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. [imitates vacuum] Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. [sucking noise] Picks it up!
It's not.
Yep.
Was it the sales department?
We'll bring them both in.
What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael?
[on phone] Michael, I am calling---
Okay!
So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?
Yeah!
Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
You know, I just want to address everyone first.
Good. [Michael leaves office]
My wife?
No.
Hi Michael how are you?
Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?
Michael. I am very sorry.
I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
Has it?
Of course I do.
Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
It's been crazy here.  You know I think you're doing a great job, right?
Hello everyone.
We are even...now. Understand? Got it?
Your company cannot be worth that much.
Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?
Michael?
Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
Sure.
Michael?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's not exactly-
Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
Just let me know.
Probable.
[laughing] What you doing?
Ever, ever...
Oh, Michael.
Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They���ve apparently just dropped the supplier they���ve been with for the last ten years. .
Erin, is Michael around?
Uh, you already have a new receptionist--
About 5,000.
Michael.
Hi, everyone.
We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
No, we're letting Jan go.
I, I - It's a tough one.
That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
OK, was it Dwight?
I'll give it my best shot, Michael.
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
You understand this is a very serious situation.
Hi.  Uh, look it's no secret--
But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
Andy.
No, we're not giving you the job.
Andy.
That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
Good luck!
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
Yeah?
Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?
I thought you liked Jim?
Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
[opens door] Andy Bernard.
Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy.
Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
Michael--
Yeah.
Yes.
[confused] Oh, Michael?
So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
[playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
That's too bad.
Yeah, yeah.
That's not necessary.
I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.
How was the ride?
Michael, is everyone okay?
We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
What?
There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
Yeah?
Might have hi--- OK, what firm?
Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.
Thanks very much.
Michael-
You made a joke?
There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
Not without cause, Michael.
Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
[on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
���By the way, Oscar says 'hi'���
Was it Jim?
Yes.
What gave you that idea?
Thanks Jim.
Look, this is important, Michael.
[on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there���s a crisis -- the more I think about it --
Jan, glad you could make it.
Michael?
Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
Yes.
Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
Goodbye Michael.
Alan will be out too. All of us.
Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.
Michael. Listen-
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
Michael...
I am gone.
Ok.
Yep.
We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
No, no.
Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet.
Yeah.
You hungry? I'm just having lunch.
Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
Ummm... okay, here's the thing though.  The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.
So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?
Okay, Michael.
Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
Okay?
You're back together.
[on speakerphone] Michael.
But it's very possible-
Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion.
A... multivitamin?
No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
Okay.  Please continue.
[reading performance report]  'Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.'
[on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?
You can't do that these days. You can't.
Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor [Michael makes exaggerated oh-my-gosh face at camera]. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.
Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.
$12,000.00
What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
Yes Michael, what is so urgent?
Yeah!
This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
Andy Bernard!
Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
They did?
Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
You have to get along with Toby.
Jim, good! You should hear this too.
I don't know
Alright Dwight. This is huge.
Okay.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.
How could you not know Michael?
Well, okay. Great to meet you.
Yes.
We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
No.
But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.
Thank you Jim.
Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe.
I see.
Michael, I have never-
You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.
Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything.  If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?
Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
It's not.
Yeah.
[same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Yes.
OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Any jobs now?
It'll be ok.
I don't have any ideas for you there.
Okay.  And your strengths?
Dwight.
Goodbye, Michael. [hangs up]
No! No, and congratulations.
Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.
Fine. What is going on?
Pleasure.
OK, Michael.
We didn't ask you to do that.
There is no plan.
Cheese platter?
Where are you working?
What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone's on board.
A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
Okay.
Yep.
Why don���t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
Things not going so well there?
Isn't our interview tomorrow?
Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
Hey, oh, okay. Wait.
Michael, good to see you!
No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
How do you think you function here in New York?
You look great.
Jan is out of town right now.
I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping]
So glad you could make it.
All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?
Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Yeah big time, yeah.
Michael, I really don't know what's going on [police sirens in background] down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
Michael.
Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now��� why would I want that? It���s worth half of what it was three years ago.
Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
What the hell?
Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file.
Yeah!
I don't think so.
[coming out from bathroom] Michael.
You-you don't like it.
Yeah?
Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
You weren't supposed to tell anyone Michael.
All right.
What do you think we could be doing better?
I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
