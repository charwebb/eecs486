What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
Um��� I���m in the middle of a piano lesson.
Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
I don't know. I mean, what can you do?
How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
[singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.
But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?
[on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there���s a crisis -- the more I think about it --
[reading performance report]  'Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.'
Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. [imitates vacuum] Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. [sucking noise] Picks it up!
Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...
I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe.
Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]
Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file.
Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They���ve apparently just dropped the supplier they���ve been with for the last ten years. .
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now��� why would I want that? It���s worth half of what it was three years ago.
Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It���s someone new but she didn���t catch her name.
Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?
Really? [reading from phone] ���Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.���
Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
...that's a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads 'Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous!  Pam'  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up...
Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael.
Uh, hey, I'm sorry.  I'm taking this out on you.
[same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
It's been crazy here.  You know I think you're doing a great job, right?
I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
Ummm... okay, here's the thing though.  The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.
Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
Alan will be out too. All of us.
Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
Why don���t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?
A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
What do you think we could be doing better?
Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.
So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?
Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping]
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.
No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.
Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You're clearly a very bright guy.
Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?
All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?
I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?
But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
No, ah it's okay Michael.  We got it.
Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
[on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.
Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
You understand this is a very serious situation.
Michael, I really don't know what's going on [police sirens in background] down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  You've given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak.
Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone's on board.
Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
[on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
[on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well... You know what?  I'm sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?
Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.
Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.
Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.
Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.
Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
[over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.
So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know.
I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh.
Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?
Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.
Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
How do you think you function here in New York?
I don't have any ideas for you there.
Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.
Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?
Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
Where do you see yourself in ten years?
So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
You know, I just want to address everyone first.
Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet.
[on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I'm so glad.  We're all very excited you're going to be joining us.  It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.
I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor [Michael makes exaggerated oh-my-gosh face at camera]. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.
Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]
Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
