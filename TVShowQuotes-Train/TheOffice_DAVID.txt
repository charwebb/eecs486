Herrow! Herrow!
Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
[opens door] Andy Bernard.
I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know.
I, I - It's a tough one.
Was it the sales department?
Hi, everyone.
You hungry? I'm just having lunch.
I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.
In the middle of a work day?
Yeah.
So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?
Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?
Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Any jobs now?
[on phone] This is David.
You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
Andy!
I thought you liked Jim?
Okay!
Michael, good to see you!
Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in.
Thank you Jim.
You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.
I believe we put you in charge.
Michael, I really don't know what's going on [police sirens in background] down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
[on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I'm so glad.  We're all very excited you're going to be joining us.  It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.
No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
Goodbye Michael.
Alright Dwight. This is huge.
Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?
Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it.
All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?
Oh.  Yes.  Very good.
Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
[on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?
Goodbye, Michael. [hangs up]
We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
Okay.  And your strengths?
What gave you that idea?
Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything.  If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?
It'll be ok.
Yeah.
Okay.  Please continue.
Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
You look great.
...what do you think about Michael Scott?
Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.
I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.
Of course I do.
Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
How was the ride?
Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
No. No dogs.
We are even...now. Understand? Got it?
Yeah?
Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
You-you don't like it.
Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
Hmm.
Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?
Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
Hello everyone.
There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
What say we do.
Andy Bernard!
Yeah!
You understand this is a very serious situation.
You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
Has it?
No! No, and congratulations.
Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.
Good work.
Okay?
[on phone] Michael, I am calling---
A... multivitamin?
No, ah it's okay Michael.  We got it.
Okay, I have to go.
Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  You've given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak.
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
No.
Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion.
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
I don't have any ideas for you there.
No.
Okay.
I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.
What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...
Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
They did?
Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone's on board.
And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
I don't know
Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You're clearly a very bright guy.
So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?
Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. [imitates vacuum] Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. [sucking noise] Picks it up!
[on speakerphone] Michael.
Andy.
Yeah?
Okay.
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe.
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.
Where are you working?
No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh.
Oh, Michael.
Thanks, Michael.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...
Pleasure.
Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
I don't understand, is anyone hurt?
[confused] Oh, Michael?
It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.
We didn't ask you to do that.
Thanks Jim.
Okay.  Deal.  Okay?
My wife?
I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.
How did you get here, Michael?
Uh.
Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy.
I don't know. I mean, what can you do?
Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.
Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.
Yeah.
Michael?
...that's a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads 'Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous!  Pam'  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up...
No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael.
Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
Yeah.
Jan, glad you could make it.
Hi Michael how are you?
Watch it Andy!
Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.
I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?
I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
Probable.
I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
Andy.
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
Keep it up, son.
Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
Yep.
There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
How do you think you function here in New York?
Good. [Michael leaves office]
Yes.
Michael?
Am I missing something?
But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
Yeah!
That's not necessary.
Pam's not a salesperson.
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.
Yes.
That's not exactly-
It's not.
Was it Jim?
[coming out from bathroom] Michael.
No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
Very good.
Ok.
Michael-
What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
That's too bad.
Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.
Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
Jan is out of town right now.
Okay.
Hey guys, long time.
We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.
Why don���t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
No, we're not giving you the job.
Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
You can't do that these days. You can't.
Good luck!
Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
I do.
Michael, is everyone okay?
I'm really looking forward to our interview.
You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
This is a very very bad time.
Michael. Listen-
You have to get along with Toby.
I am gone.
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
Your company cannot be worth that much.
Where do you see yourself in ten years?
That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.
Thanks very much.
It's been crazy here.  You know I think you're doing a great job, right?
A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
What?
Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li [bleep].  That's what it sounds like.
Fine. What is going on?
Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
Michael?
Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet.
No.
No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It���s someone new but she didn���t catch her name.
But it's very possible-
Hey, oh, okay. Wait.
I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]
Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
Look, this is important, Michael.
Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
[same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
Things not going so well there?
Isn't our interview tomorrow?
Michael.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now��� why would I want that? It���s worth half of what it was three years ago.
You're back together.
So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
I find that extraordinarily surprising.
I don't think so.
OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
Okay, Michael.
Yeah!
This is off the record.
So glad you could make it.
Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
Okay, I will look at it Monday.
No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?
Michael, I have never-
Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
Alan will be out too. All of us.
���By the way, Oscar says 'hi'���
Nice to meet you.
I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
[over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.
Yeah! Teddy!
[opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.
Yeah.
Is this why you're calling me?
Yes.
[laughing] What you doing?
How could you not know Michael?
We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
Stephanie, can you hop off please?
[playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
Yes.
You know, I just want to address everyone first.
I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping]
Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file.
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Please do.
[reading performance report]  'Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.'
It's not.
Hi.  Uh, look it's no secret--
Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?
I'll be fired.
Erin, is Michael around?
Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.
Really? [reading from phone] ���Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.���
All right.
You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]
Um��� I���m in the middle of a piano lesson.
Yes.
Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.
No, we're letting Jan go.
No.
Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.
Michael.
Mmhmm.
No.
Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor [Michael makes exaggerated oh-my-gosh face at camera]. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.
Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
[singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
Thank you for coming.
How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
No, no.
[on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
Yeah!
I see.
Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
Ummm... okay, here's the thing though.  The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.
This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They���ve apparently just dropped the supplier they���ve been with for the last ten years. .
Yep.
What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.
OK, Michael.
Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
Not without cause, Michael.
Might have hi--- OK, what firm?
[on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there���s a crisis -- the more I think about it --
Yes, as we've discussed-
There is no plan.
Michael...
Michael?
Yes.
Yeah.
What do you think we could be doing better?
Hmmm.
$12,000.00
Just let me know.
You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
