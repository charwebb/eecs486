Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.
But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well... You know what?  I'm sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?
Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.
I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.
How do you think you function here in New York?
Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?
No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It���s someone new but she didn���t catch her name.
[playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
[on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there���s a crisis -- the more I think about it --
[on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now��� why would I want that? It���s worth half of what it was three years ago.
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]
Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor [Michael makes exaggerated oh-my-gosh face at camera]. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.
We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.
Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping]
I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...
Um��� I���m in the middle of a piano lesson.
That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.
You know, I just want to address everyone first.
So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?
Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file.
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.
Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
[same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.
You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.
Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion.
[on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?
Alan will be out too. All of us.
Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?
Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
No, ah it's okay Michael.  We got it.
Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe.
Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.
Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
Really? [reading from phone] ���Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.���
Ummm... okay, here's the thing though.  The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.
Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
Why don���t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
[over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.
Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
[on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.
Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet.
It's been crazy here.  You know I think you're doing a great job, right?
[reading performance report]  'Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.'
[singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?
You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
[on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
You understand this is a very serious situation.
Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  You've given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak.
You can't do that these days. You can't.
Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
I don't have any ideas for you there.
Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.
How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?
Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.
Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.
Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?
Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.
What do you think we could be doing better?
I don't know. I mean, what can you do?
Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael.
Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. [imitates vacuum] Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. [sucking noise] Picks it up!
Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier.
You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
...that's a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads 'Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous!  Pam'  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up...
[on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I'm so glad.  We're all very excited you're going to be joining us.  It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.
What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.
What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone's on board.
Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
Uh, hey, I'm sorry.  I'm taking this out on you.
I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know.
There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You're clearly a very bright guy.
Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
