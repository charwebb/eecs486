Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.
Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.
Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file.
[on phone] Michael, I am calling---
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
There is no plan.
Hi Michael how are you?
Sure.
Very good.
Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.
Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They���ve apparently just dropped the supplier they���ve been with for the last ten years. .
Goodbye, Michael. [hangs up]
Okay.
Good work.
[coming out from bathroom] Michael.
Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?
No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
I don't know. I mean, what can you do?
Michael?
I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?
Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
[on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?
Thank you for coming.
I, I - It's a tough one.
Michael.
But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?
You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
Of course I do.
[on speakerphone] Michael.
Please do.
Yep.
Andy.
Yes.
Yeah.
[on phone] This is David.
Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
Pam's not a salesperson.
Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.
You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
Michael...
Mmhmm.
Uh.
Yes.
No.
How was the ride?
But it's very possible-
Yeah!
Good luck!
We are even...now. Understand? Got it?
Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  You've given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak.
Andy!
So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
[playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
What the hell?
Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
You're back together.
That's not exactly-
I see.
No! No, and congratulations.
You weren't supposed to tell anyone Michael.
Hi, everyone.
You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
Where are you working?
Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Probable.
You know, I just want to address everyone first.
I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.
I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
Ever, ever...
Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.
Yeah!
Dwight.
No, no.
Thank you Jim.
I do.
Hello everyone.
Watch it Andy!
I'm really looking forward to our interview.
Okay.  And your strengths?
Hmm.
Michael. Listen-
Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
No. No dogs.
That's too bad.
I'll give it my best shot, Michael.
Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
A... multivitamin?
A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
Fine. What is going on?
What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael?
That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.
I believe we put you in charge.
Might have hi--- OK, what firm?
Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...
No, we're letting Jan go.
Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet.
My wife?
Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.
Not without cause, Michael.
Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
Michael-
I don't have any ideas for you there.
You have to get along with Toby.
What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.
Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
In the middle of a work day?
Yes.
No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Ok.
[on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.
Your company cannot be worth that much.
Yes.
So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?
Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it.
Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?
That's not necessary.
Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in.
Yeah.
So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?
Well, okay. Great to meet you.
How did you get here, Michael?
OK, Michael.
Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?
Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
[reading performance report]  'Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.'
We'll bring them both in.
Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
Okay!
What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
Any jobs now?
Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
Michael?
[on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
So glad you could make it.
I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
[laughing] What you doing?
[same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
No.
Shh.
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
Hey Sweetie, what is it?
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
Michael?
Things not going so well there?
I don't think so.
Okay, I have to go.
This is a very very bad time.
Goodbye Michael.
Hi.  Uh, look it's no secret--
Hey, oh, okay. Wait.
You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.
Andy Bernard!
No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh.
[opens door] Andy Bernard.
Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]
Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
What?
No, we're not giving you the job.
Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.
Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now��� why would I want that? It���s worth half of what it was three years ago.
Just let me know.
You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.
Jan is out of town right now.
It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.
Herrow! Herrow!
It'll be ok.
Yeah.
Okay?
Yeah?
So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
I'll be fired.
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
Was it the sales department?
We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
Yeah.
[on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?
Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li [bleep].  That's what it sounds like.
I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
Suck it. That's what it's called.
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
It's not.
Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
OK, was it Dwight?
Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy.
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
I thought you liked Jim?
All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?
Yep.
Okay, I will look at it Monday.
Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
Michael--
You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping]
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
[over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.
Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
This is off the record.
Michael, I really don't know what's going on [police sirens in background] down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
Michael, good to see you!
We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
Thanks very much.
Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
No.
I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
You made a joke?
Michael. I am very sorry.
Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
Okay.  Please continue.
Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything.  If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?
There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
Am I missing something?
Thanks, Michael.
Yes, as we've discussed-
You hungry? I'm just having lunch.
You understand this is a very serious situation.
Thanks Jim.
Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier.
Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
Look, this is important, Michael.
No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It���s someone new but she didn���t catch her name.
Yeah?
Erin, is Michael around?
Hmmm.
Pleasure.
[confused] Oh, Michael?
Was it Jim?
Yes.
Yeah!
They did?
I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know.
Keep it up, son.
Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
How could you not know Michael?
Yeah?
Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor [Michael makes exaggerated oh-my-gosh face at camera]. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.
Hey guys, long time.
I am gone.
...what do you think about Michael Scott?
Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?
You-you don't like it.
Alright Dwight. This is huge.
Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
Cheese platter?
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
Michael?
...that's a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads 'Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous!  Pam'  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up...
Really? [reading from phone] ���Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.���
Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
Yep.
Uh, you already have a new receptionist--
About 5,000.
Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
What gave you that idea?
[on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I'm so glad.  We're all very excited you're going to be joining us.  It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.
Isn't our interview tomorrow?
[opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.
Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe.
Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]
���By the way, Oscar says 'hi'���
I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
Okay.
But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well... You know what?  I'm sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Yeah!
Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Good. [Michael leaves office]
You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
You can't do that these days. You can't.
I find that extraordinarily surprising.
We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
Andy.
Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You're clearly a very bright guy.
Yes.
Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael.
All right.
Yes.
Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
Yes Michael, what is so urgent?
But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
What say we do.
Okay.  Deal.  Okay?
No.
It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.
I don't know
Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
Yeah.
Michael, I have never-
Um��� I���m in the middle of a piano lesson.
No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
Yes.
Oh.  Yes.  Very good.
Uh, hey, I'm sorry.  I'm taking this out on you.
Is this why you're calling me?
Nice to meet you.
Michael.
Why don���t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.
How do you think you function here in New York?
That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.
[nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]
Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
