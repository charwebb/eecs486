Great. I'll put your order in right now. 
What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.
I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
I gotta get these curly fries to Table 12. 
Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay? 
Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??
Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you.  Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay? 
Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie.  Why don't you just come down to Raisins?
Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you.
Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay? 
Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
Oh, okay. Hi, cutie.  Hey sweetie.  So how are you, honey?
