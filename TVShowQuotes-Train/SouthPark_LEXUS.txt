Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay? 
What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.
Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here, youuu! 
Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??
Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you.  Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay? 
Great. I'll put your order in right now. 
Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay? 
Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you.
Oh, okay. Hi, cutie.  Hey sweetie.  So how are you, honey?
Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie.  Why don't you just come down to Raisins?
I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
