Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?
We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.
Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.
Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?
Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "nigger guys"? 
Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 
Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!
You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself! 
You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!
Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. 
Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?
Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 
Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right?
Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!
Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.
Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 
Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!
Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.
My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. 
Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever.
Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. 
We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.
Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.
That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.
Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!
Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.
Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him. 
No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!
Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 
Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!
You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!
Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!
Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?
Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.
Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 
Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. 
That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home.
Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 
Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!
No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!
You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.
Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 
I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started...
Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?
We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!
Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!
He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
Leave me alone I don't have any change!
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 
Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!
Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!
Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it.
Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! 
Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!
Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! 
You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? 
There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!
Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.
I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?
My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!
Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!
Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.
Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 
I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.
But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.
Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.
No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.
Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go.
Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.
The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
You kind of seem shitty to me too.
It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah! 
Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Great, thanks.  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.
Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?
Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 
Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 
"Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"  "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man.
Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?
What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!
Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!
She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!
That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!
Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic.
Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 
Hey Bat Dad!  I didn't hear no bell.
Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.
I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!
Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black! 
Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.
No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.
Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.
Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!
AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?!
Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.
Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.
That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.
Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 
I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. 
Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. 
You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!
I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.
Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! "Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom." Oh, we need this! 
Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
All right, look, we've been here for over three hours
The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!
Get back inside. We have work to do. 
Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 
Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. 
Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 
KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.
Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 
Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.
Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!
Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. 
Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!
We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.
I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! 
Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-
So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?
This is America! This is an honest America!
Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
Shelly? Shelly?  Shelly, come on. We have to go!
Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 
Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! 
Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 
Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 
Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go! 
I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 
I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. 
You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 
Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. 
I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.
It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.
Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?
Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.
Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.
Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?
Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!
Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? 
We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.
No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
"It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross!
Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!
Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 
Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 
Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?
Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?
Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!
All right, let's not make that mistake again.
Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 
So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!
I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.
I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
Well at least that part's like the Internet.
We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 
What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!
Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.
You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 
AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
How much do we have to raise, Mayor?
Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"?
Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.
Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 
You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!
Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?
Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. 
Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!
Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.
I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.
My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.
Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 
Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.
Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. 
Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.
Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.
You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 
It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.
Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 
Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold
Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.
You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. 
And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.
More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.
...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!
Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 
Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!
The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made." 
Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.
Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!
Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.
Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.
Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...
Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.
If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.
Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?
Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!
This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 
I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.
What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!
You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?
A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal.
Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?
Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.
NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.
But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.
Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!
You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! 
Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the "Don't be scared"  and of course there's the-
Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.
I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!
Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on.  Wa-hang on, hang on. 
God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! 
"Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers." Alright.  "Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..."  "slow-growing and can take years to develop." Dammit.  "Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive." Oh this is good. "There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?
Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.
In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?
I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
If all your friends jumped off a cliff,  would you do that too?
Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.
Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.
Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie.
Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.
Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!
I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?
Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 
Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 
Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?
Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.
Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.
Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.
Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls. 
Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!
It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.
You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!
Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! 
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.
No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 
No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. 
Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 
Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...
Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 
Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 
Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 
They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. 
Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 
Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
I know it but I don't think I should say it.
Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!
Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?
You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.
Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. 
Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!
Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. 
You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!
It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!
All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 
Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.
Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.
Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.
Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.
Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!
Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. 
Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!
It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. 
The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!
No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!
This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!
No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 
Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?
Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
How do you think I met your mother?
All right, what the hell is going on here?!
Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! 
Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...
A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!
Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.
The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.
These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 
When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?
Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! 
Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!
The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??
Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...
...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.
This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! 
But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. 
Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! 
Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. 
Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!
Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.
Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 
Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. 
Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.
Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-
For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. 
Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!  Stan?  You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! 
Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.
Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. 
I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!
GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 
All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.
I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.
How long do I have to stay here?!
What the hell is that?  Who put that there?
You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! 
Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.
Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.
Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 
Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 
It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!  Can you help me stop them?!
GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.
Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 
Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!
That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"
Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?
Alright, listen up.  The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.  It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God!
Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!
Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 
So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! 
Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am? 
Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. 
Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.
At least we're smart enough to know better!
No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.
Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.
Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! 
Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.
Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 
Aw, you people have me on camera now?
Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance.
They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.
His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.
Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 
Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say "Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy."  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! "Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just "Nigger Guy".  Respect. 
Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 
You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.
Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!
Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.
Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.
I don't think so, you son of a bitch! 
That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. 
Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!
Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!
Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power.
Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. 
Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 
A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! 
No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! 
Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 
I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!
Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease. 
Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!
Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!
Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.
Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.
Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.
All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 
Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!
Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! 
We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 
Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! 
I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 
Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!
Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.
I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.
Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  "Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."  Stan?
Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!
I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! 
Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. 
Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! 
Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh?
Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 
Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 
Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys.
All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.
Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. 
Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs.
It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? 
Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.
Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.
I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.
We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!
Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?
All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*
Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!
Who who did you hear is, is gay?!
You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
You want me to kick your ass right here?! 
When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. 
Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. 
Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! 
Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 
Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault.
Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. 
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. 
Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!
We can stand here as long as it takes. 
You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! 
Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool?
Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 
Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.
Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?
Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 
Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?
Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!
This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place.
Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. 
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. 
Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.
Oh, do we have to do it right now?
Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 
Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.
Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. 
Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!
And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?
No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.
It is time for us all to grow up.
Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.
Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!
I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! 
But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.
If it means war, then we say NO!
Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!
Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 
I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. 
Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?
Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...
And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!
All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.
Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.
Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.
Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 
I am not chugging beer!  I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! 
See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?
Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck.
Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.
Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?
I know! Are we watching at your house?!
No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.
Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.
How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.
"Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."
I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO! 
Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row!
And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! 
I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. 
Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.
Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 
They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!
Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again. 
Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. 
Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person "Randy" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 
That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!
Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!
I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?
One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.
Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!
Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?
City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.
I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.
The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.
Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.
Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?
Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?
Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.
We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. 
What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing.
I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.
Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.
Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.
Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.
Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
A startup company? A company that does what?
I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?
Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Bzzz bzzz. 
No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.
MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
Here we see a view from outside the bus.
Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. 
Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?
Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 
Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.
Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 
All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.
Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!
Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!
Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. 
Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? 
Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!
Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.
Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!
Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.
Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.
I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 
Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.
Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! 
Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.
Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 
Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.
An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!
You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!
My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. 
So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? 
Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
Will he be okay out of the hospital?
This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! 
I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?
Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. 
They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! 
Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. 
We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!
They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh! 
Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!
Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!
Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.
Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 
Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 
Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!
Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?
Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...
Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.
Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.
What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.
Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!
Looks like next harvest will be even better. 
Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.
Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 
We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?
It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?
Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. 
Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 
Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans.
Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! 
No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?
I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!
Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.
Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.  All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. Whew, that was hard.
I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!
Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww...
Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit?  Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-Shu-Sharon? 
Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!
Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? 
Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?
...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 
Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!
Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 
Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.
Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?
Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please to put a penny in the old man's-
NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?
Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.
Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? 
Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 
No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  "Hello."  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 
City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much 
We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!
Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
Get inside! We have to close these doors! 
Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!
And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 
I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.
Uh, look, I just want to tell you that
You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! 
You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!
Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.
This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!
Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!
You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!
Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. 
Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.
Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang. 
Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.
Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! 
With all due respect, clichй dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. 
Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 
But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.
Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!
It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
No, it does NOT  sound nice!  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.
Don't be a fag!  Come on! We can make it!  We have to try!
Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.
They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!
Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
I just... don't think I can, all right?
No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.
Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-
Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!
A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 
Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.
You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers. 
Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?
Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.
It looks like she had a heart attack.
Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?
That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 
Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!
Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.
We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?
Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.
The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 
Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.
No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!
I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 
Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle. 
No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. 
Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 
I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.
Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!
Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 
Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?
Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. 
Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? 
This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.
Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.
Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!
I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important.
We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! 
Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!
Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!
Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.
Is it really as bad as they say it is?
Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.
Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!
You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance?
Yeah, me too.  Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! 
Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.
Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,
All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. 
Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.
It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 
$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.
Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.
Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.
Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!
It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.
And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 
I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers.
Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!
I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 
There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.
Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.
Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying "That's my son!"  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. 
We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!
Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.
This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"?
Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!
I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.
It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. 
Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?
A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 
We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.
I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
You guys wanna put some money on it? 
Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.
There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!
Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 
Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! 
...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.
Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. 
Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.
I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
Not one more good person dies on my watch! 
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.
What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!
Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 
Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.
Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!
Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "nigger guy".
Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 
Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  "Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn"  "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."
I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.
This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.
Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.
And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. 
Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! 
It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!
I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. 
Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. 
What does that have to do with anything? 
Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, 
He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.
Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter!
I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.
Where did you get that kind of money??
Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.
We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!
I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!
Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!
All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!
Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! 
Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!
The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.
Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.
What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them!
Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells."
There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.
I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!  Oh crap.
We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 
Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!
Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. 
Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!
Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
What? I thought this was a free country! 
Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?
Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.
They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.
Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.
THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  SHIT!! 
If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.
Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. 
He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.
Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 
Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!
And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.
It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! 
Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the "no" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!
No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!
Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 
No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud
We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather. 
Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!
Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!
You can barely even tell you have one on.
Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.
Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." 
Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.
He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!
What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 
Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.
Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!
No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.
Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.
Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?
Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.
Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 
Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real. 
Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 
Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.
What? What did I do?!  What did I do?!
Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!
I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.
Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 
...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.
You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  "Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!"  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!
I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.
He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.
Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.
Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.
Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!
Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!
