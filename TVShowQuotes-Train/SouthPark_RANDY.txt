Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls. 
...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!
It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.
Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.
They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. 
All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
Where did you get that kind of money??
Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!
Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person "Randy" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 
I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!
Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. 
Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.
Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. 
The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. 
Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!
I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home.
Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!
Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.
It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 
No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.
Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 
Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.
Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real. 
GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 
Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!
Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.
Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 
Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." 
Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!
You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!
Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! 
The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO! 
You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 
There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?
Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. 
...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! 
I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-
He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.
Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.
Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 
Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?
Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 
I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!
Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!
We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.
Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!
He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. 
Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. 
Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. 
I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.
All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.
O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 
And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys.
You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! 
And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! 
But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic.
Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.
Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Shelly? Shelly?  Shelly, come on. We have to go!
And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important.
Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 
Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  "Hello."  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 
And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
All right, what the hell is going on here?!
I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 
You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.
Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself! 
If all your friends jumped off a cliff,  would you do that too?
I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 
Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. 
Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.
My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!
Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance?
And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.
Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  "Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!"  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!
So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! 
What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! 
You can barely even tell you have one on.
Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault.
Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! 
We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*
Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!
Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!
Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 
One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers.
Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! 
No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.
Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?
"Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"  "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man.
Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!
It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...
Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.
I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.
Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!
The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 
Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.
I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!
Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!
Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.
Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!
Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.  All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. Whew, that was hard.
There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.
I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 
You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!
I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. 
Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?
Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle. 
My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 
Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!
Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
Alright, listen up.  The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.  It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God!
What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!
Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.
No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.
We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!
Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!
All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.
That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.
You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!
Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.
Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!
Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.
Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.
Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. 
I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.
The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
No, it does NOT  sound nice!  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.
Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 
Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. 
Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!
Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.
No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 
Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.
Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh?
Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
I know! Are we watching at your house?!
Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? 
Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.
Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?
Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.
Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,
Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 
Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? 
No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!
No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.
I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.
Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.
Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!
I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.
I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!  Can you help me stop them?!
It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?
It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 
Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. 
Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!
How do you think I met your mother?
You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!
Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 
Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.
I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!
Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!
Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, 
Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!
With all due respect, clichй dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. 
That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. 
Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. 
...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.
Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.
There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?
Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! "Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom." Oh, we need this! 
On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 
Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.
Leave me alone I don't have any change!
I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!
Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.
Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?
Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease. 
Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.
They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!
Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 
On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 
Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.
Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
What? I thought this was a free country! 
Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie.
Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. 
Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!
Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.
Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.
The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
What? What did I do?!  What did I do?!
It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh! 
Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.
Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Great, thanks.  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.
Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.
Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.
No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! 
Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.
Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 
You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!
Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.
Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.
Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.
All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!
Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...
But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.
Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  "Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn"  "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."
Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather. 
Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 
Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!
"It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross!
Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!  Stan?  You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! 
Yeah, me too.  Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! 
Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.
Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!
Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 
Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. 
Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!
This is America! This is an honest America!
I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!
Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it.
Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. 
Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!
Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.
Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the "no" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!
No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.
Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. 
Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?
All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.
Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool?
I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!
Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on.  Wa-hang on, hang on. 
Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing.
I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.
Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! 
I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.
Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!
No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying "That's my son!"  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. 
Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. 
I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started...
His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.
Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?
What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?
Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.
I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the "Don't be scared"  and of course there's the-
No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.
No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!
Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 
Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.
Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.
Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. 
Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.
We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black! 
Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!
Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.
Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans.
Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 
Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?
Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.
You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.
...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?
Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit! 
Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. 
The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!
Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! 
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!
Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! 
We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.
He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?
And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"?
City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much 
Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.
I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.
Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
Hey Bat Dad!  I didn't hear no bell.
Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 
Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.
Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him.
Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.
Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 
Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.
Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!
I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.
Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.
Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?
Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-
Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!
Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 
Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!
Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter!
I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 
I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 
Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 
You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!
I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!
My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!
Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 
Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.
Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.
Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! 
Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him. 
Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!
Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang. 
I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.
You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!
Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.
Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "nigger guys"? 
Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!
Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 
Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 
All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.
Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? 
Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.
Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 
Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.
Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.
No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. 
Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! 
All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 
Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!
How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! 
Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!
It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.
Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.
How do we get our runaway children back?
Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. 
One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 
Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?
Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please to put a penny in the old man's-
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. 
Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. 
I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!
Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.
Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 
No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.
That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 
Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 
Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.
All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 
All right, look, we've been here for over three hours
I just... don't think I can, all right?
We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!
Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again. 
Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 
Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!
Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 
Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.
Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.
Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.
What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 
Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 
Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs.
I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. 
O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.
I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. 
Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.
If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?
Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.
See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-
Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!
Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.
Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!
Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.
Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.
No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.
Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!
At least we're smart enough to know better!
Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.
How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!
Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.
Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.
Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!
I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.
Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!
Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.
They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. 
You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. 
Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!
Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! 
What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 
Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!
Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 
Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?
Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
Aw, you people have me on camera now?
I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
Is it really as bad as they say it is?
OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.
For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.
Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.
Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.
I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.
Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 
Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. 
What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. 
Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-
All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 
Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 
Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 
Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.
Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.
Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.
What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!
It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 
Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.
Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.
I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!
This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.
What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 
That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.
Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 
My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. 
Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! 
Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.
Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?
Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?
D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"?
Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever.
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.
Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.
Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?
Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
I can't do it! I can't do it!
There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!
What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!
Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!
Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?
Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?
Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.
Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!
Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.
You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? 
I am not chugging beer!  I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! 
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. 
When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.
Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?
What the hell is that?  Who put that there?
Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. 
Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.
Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 
Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 
I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!
Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.
Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 
I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 
Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.
Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.
It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.
It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.
In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?
If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.
Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! 
Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.
This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. 
Looks like next harvest will be even better. 
Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.
It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 
Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!
It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. 
That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!
Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 
Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.
Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!
No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 
Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.
I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?
Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.
Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!
You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.
Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!
Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?! 
Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.
So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?
Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.
I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.
So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. 
Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold
...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.
Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the "nigger" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on "Wheel of Fortune", you know and... and when people call me... "nigger guy"... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 
You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 
Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.
Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.
And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.
Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?
Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!
Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. 
Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?
Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 
Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.
Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!
Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.
Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?
I don't think so, you son of a bitch! 
Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...
This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!
Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.
Get inside! We have to close these doors! 
To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.
Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?
Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.
I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.
Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.
Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 
Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  SHIT!! 
It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! 
You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! 
Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!
You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 
Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.
Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.
Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!
Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.
Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! 
Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?
Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!
Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 
Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say "Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy."  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! "Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just "Nigger Guy".  Respect. 
We can stand here as long as it takes. 
Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place.
Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!
Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!
Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 
Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
You want me to kick your ass right here?! 
You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck.
Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.
Who who did you hear is, is gay?!
Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?
Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 
Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.
Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!
Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 
Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 
Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!
Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!
Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!
Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? 
Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!
I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?
Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.
Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?
I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!  Oh crap.
Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah! 
Oh, do we have to do it right now?
You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.
They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 
That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.
Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. 
If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.
I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"
Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.
Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells."
The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go! 
Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 
Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!
What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 
Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.
All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.
Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 
That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!
Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. 
We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. 
I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!
I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.
How long do I have to stay here?!
The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?
You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. 
Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 
No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?
No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?
Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! 
Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.
You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
Don't be a fag!  Come on! We can make it!  We have to try!
It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 
You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!
We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.
Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud
It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.
Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 
City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Bzzz bzzz. 
Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?
Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!
Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!
Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!
But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! 
That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 
Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.
Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.
Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.
Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!
Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 
Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. 
Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.
The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. 
Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. 
A startup company? A company that does what?
Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!
I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?
GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! 
Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.
He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.
No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!
We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!
I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.
Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 
Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!
Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? 
We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! 
Not one more good person dies on my watch! 
According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. 
Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. 
Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. 
You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! 
Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 
Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!
They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance.
I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.
Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?
Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.
You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
"He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this- 
I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!
You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-
Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.
And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
Uh, look, I just want to tell you that
Well at least that part's like the Internet.
Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.
No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! 
I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?
Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go.
Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel! 
Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!
Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?
Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!
What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them!
Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "nigger guy".
This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.
Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.
It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.
Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!
All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. 
Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!
Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...
Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
All right, let's not make that mistake again.
Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! 
Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?
Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me.
"Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."
I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!
I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?
We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! 
Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? 
Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 
Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!
Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.
Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!
Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  "Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."  Stan?
Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit?  Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-Shu-Sharon? 
...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!
Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?
Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?
We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. 
Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. 
So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? 
Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!
I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 
Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! 
...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am? 
How much do we have to raise, Mayor?
All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. 
I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 
No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.
I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.
We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!
Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. 
Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.
Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!
I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 
I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.
No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! 
No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!
Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!
Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 
Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 
Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!
I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 
The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! 
Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?
Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! 
Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys.
Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. 
It looks like she had a heart attack.
Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.
It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! 
NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 
This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! 
Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?
I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.
Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...
No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. 
Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?
Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!
Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??
Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!
Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 
It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.
What does that have to do with anything? 
No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. 
Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!
Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 
Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.
Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 
More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!
Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 
Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.
Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.
Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 
Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 
No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.
That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 
MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
You guys wanna put some money on it? 
Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row!
Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.
We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. 
They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!
I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.
Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 
Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?
Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. 
Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. 
Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.
Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. 
But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.
You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 
Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 
Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!
Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!
But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! 
Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.
AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?!
Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! 
Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 
And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?
Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! 
Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 
You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! 
I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! 
Here we see a view from outside the bus.
I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal.
Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?
That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 
I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.
I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 
One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.
Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 
Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!
