I just... don't think I can, all right?

What?

Hamburger Helper?

Oh My God!! 

This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!

I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!

She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.

Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!

Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.

See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.

Now! 

Okay...

Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.

Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 

I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.

Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.

Why can't you ever just support me?!

Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 

Face it, we're gonna starve!

They let you stay for free?

Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! 

"He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this- 

Harrrh!

That thing is famous? Why?

What was that?? 

Hello?

Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.

Sorry sorry, that's me.  Hello?

Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.

Let's just get out of here. 

Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.

S-stan. STAAAN!

Well, you never know. Maybe--

Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!

I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. 

Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.

He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.

Doctor?

It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?

Isn't this great food?

Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.

Okay! 

Ahhh.

Yeah, I got lube right here.

That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.

Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?

Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!

Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.

Staaan!

I just gave you change!

But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-

No, what happened?

You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!

Get back to your room, Shelly! 

Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.

Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?

Here we see a view from outside the bus.

I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!

Sure will be nice. 

D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"?

Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?

The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.

I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!

No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.

Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!

Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. 

Oh, yeah. 

Three minutes would be plenty.

I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?

They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!

It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.

Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!

Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.

Give me a second, would you?

Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?

Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!

Oh, Stan! 

Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!

He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. 

Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.

Well, hello, ladies.

You need to shape up, mister.

No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof.

"Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"  "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man.

Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.

Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.

Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?

What is that?

And we want-

That's right, yep, you're the first ones.

Punched his trees, huh?

City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.

I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?

Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 

Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 

Pfft! That's none's the cool.

I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?

Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!

How's your mom? Your, your sister?

There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.

I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!

Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?

Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?

Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 

Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.

You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.

I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!

You know we're all cutting down on phone time.

You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! 

Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.

Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.

It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 

This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.

Sweetheart, you saw the news...

Dammit.

She's such a train wreck!

Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?

Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!

Huh.  That's weird.

Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 

...Hey, you didn't get beeped.

ЎPueblo, no bueno! ЎPueblo es muy mal! 

Uh... a disease?

We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!

What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?

Well, no, no, I just-

Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!

Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.

All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.

Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?

Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?

Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. 

Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! 

No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.

Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.

Aah ahhh aha ahhh.

Ohhh.

Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.

And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH! 

Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please to put a penny in the old man's-

What'd you say?!

Hey!

How do we get our runaway children back?

Aaaah!  Yeaaah... &lt;/&gt;

Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?

AAAAA!  AAAAA! 

What?

That's my boy.

Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Great, thanks.  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?

GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!

Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!

Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!

I'm a geologist!

That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 

I love Candy Crush.

It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.

Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!

He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!

Heeey!

Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.

Yeah, whatever.

... This is cum. 

We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 

...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?

WHERE?!

...I don't get it.

You got served? By who?

Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.

Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.

You did it, son! You did it!

No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!

Come on, Stan.

What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them!

You bet.

We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.

Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!

Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!

Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold

I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.

Ohhh, never mind. 

Shelly! 

Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!

Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! 

Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?

No! Nobody's is!

Oh my God, it's on fire! 

I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!

To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.

I was told to!

Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!

Let 'em be pissed off, then!

Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.

I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers!

Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?

Just trying to leave without being rude.

Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!

BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!

You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?

You get in the truck right now! 

Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.

Fuck you! 

No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!

What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! 

Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...

I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!

Where do we want them?

Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?

Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person "Randy" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 

Well what are we waiting for?

What do we want?

HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!

Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...

You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place.

Ooo, what's that?

Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!

Oh. Well okay, great.

Do you still love me?

Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!  Stan?  You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! 

Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.

Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.

Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.

I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?

The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.

All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!

Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?

Staaaan? 

"Internet Porn Simulator" 

There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.

Uhh, yes, Officer?

Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.

Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff. 

Waaah!  Awwww!  Stay away!  Stay awayhay!

Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!

That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.

Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.

Right right. Does vodka count?

Well, Stan, it's not really our-

Staaan! 

Stan! 

Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.

I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.

No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!

Here he comes! 

Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?

Come on Stanley, let's go. 

Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.

Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?

What's the matter with him?

Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. 

They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.

If all your friends jumped off a cliff,  would you do that too?

It was... a trick?

Aww, stupid commercials.

Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!

Ow! That hurt!

Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?

All right? Stan? Okay?

Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!

That makes sense.

You wanna go watch?

Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!

Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row!

Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!

Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!

Stanley, I... Skylarkings?

What are you talking about?

Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.

O ba ma! O ba ma!

Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.

Yahtzee!

The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.

Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!

Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right?

Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.

How painful is "painful"?

Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. 

If we have to! Siddown Glen!

Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!

With what?  With what? 

Really??

Look, Glen. We're saved. 

A television! 

Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.

Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!

Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!

Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. 

Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! 

Huh?

It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?

Oh, well that's good.

The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. 

Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?

Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? 

Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.

We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.

Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.

Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 

They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!

Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?

We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.

What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!

Dammit!

Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!

Me.

Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.

Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?

Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!

It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?

There's nothing to talk about.

Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?

I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.

All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*

Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.

It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. 

I'm going to die!

Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.

Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.

Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!

Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 

You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?

We're out of s'more schnapps?

Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!

With two girls or two guys?

There isn't enough food for more people up here!

Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 

I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!

Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!

You're from Cirque du Cheville. 

Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.

Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!

Bi kute.

Sharon, what are the boys doing?

Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." 

Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.

I wasn't watching food channels!

Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!

It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!

Dad, what are you doing??

I don't interrupt you.

The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?

A whole year?

Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!

Hey, Mr. Nelson.

I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.

Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.

That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 

I'm...  I'm not ready...

You're the new scout leader?

Oh. 

Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...

Jamie Oliver!

No...

Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am? 

Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?

Oh my God...

I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!

Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!

Stan?

All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. 

Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?

Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. 

Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.

Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?

What happened to him?

Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?

Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. 

No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.

No, sorry, I don't have any change.

Uh... NO I mean...  I like it.

We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?

Boys! Boys!

And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.

Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.

Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.

I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.

Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool?

Yeah, with our own eyes.

It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?

The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! 

Hey there, son.

And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.

Okay, okay. 

What do you want?

I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!

I know it's not a real ticket!!

Yeah, I'm playing from the office.

Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.

Oooo! Booom!

Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!

It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly!

...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.

ManBearPig?

Oh, I see. So when does the game start?

Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 

Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.

What are?!

Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 

Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! 

You mean it? I'm not gay?

It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.

No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.

Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.

...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?

No??

Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 

My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!

Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?

Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!

This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!

We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. 

Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!

Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?

Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. 

Aw, you people have me on camera now?

Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him. 

Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer.

Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.

So is there Internet here?

Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.

No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.

Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! 

Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.

Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.

Well, maybe it's time.

They can play guitar now?

You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!

Noh uh.

No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.

Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole!

Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.

I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.

Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.

With all due respect, clichй dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. 

You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! 

I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!

Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!

Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!

Wow!

It is time for a sue-ance.

I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.

Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.

And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 

Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.

Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.

Yeeaahh!

But the statue wasn't a miracle!

I know it but I don't think I should say it.

KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!

Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.

Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real. 

What's going on?

What are you? A McCain voter?

Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 

Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...

Okay, problem solved.

Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?

Do what??

Alright son! Yeah!!

We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.

Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. 

Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. 

Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! 

We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!

Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.

I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.

That's... tricky...

This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 

How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!

Hey. My eyes are up here.

There's more to life than profits!

Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!

It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?

Oh, shi- 

Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.

Okay.

Uh oh! 

Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.

Oh, no.

No! That was a copy of me!

Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.

What?! 

Check.

What?! 

Subliminal messages?

I know where it is! 

Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! 

My musical has lots of subtext.

I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 

Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. 

And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.

We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.

Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.

Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!

I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!

Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.

And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!

I'm going to Beaverton.

Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power.

What?  Hey, hey Sharon.

No.

I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.

No! I think I might have it.

Seven centimeters...

Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!

Stan?

No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. 

This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! 

Yours? What?

Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?

Stan? Okay?

It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.

I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.

Yes I do, yes I do.

You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.

Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!

All right, time to win some money!

Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!

Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.

I said get me in there!

What are they doing?  Don't leave us!

Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.

Sorry folks, just one second here.

Oh no! Oho oho. 

That's completely different!

Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.

Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.

Not now, Stanley. 

Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.

Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.

It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 

Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!

Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.

I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 

We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. 

Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.

Our house... It has no Internet.

FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!

Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.

Hey, Mr. Allens.

You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!

You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!

What?

Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.

Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.

Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!

Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?

Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? 

Oh really? About... about what?

Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!

Where do we want them?

No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. 

Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 

Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!

So who won, Mr. Mackey?

There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.

No!

Yes I can! Yes I can! 

I guess it was pretty big.

Well, you're about to be.

That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 

Wooo, change.

Sharon? Sharon!

You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?

Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?

Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. 

Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!

NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!

All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.

Ooof. 

With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.

A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal.

Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.

How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?

Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 

The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!

Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.

Ohh! Ohh! Duuude! 

We don't have any change! Go away!

Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!

Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the "no" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!

Stan?  Stan!

Oh! Yes! 

Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?

They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.

Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta.

All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 

Hm. Really?

Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!

You don't understand the issues, Sharon!

So you boys like this music, huh?

Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.

We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!

Ey, that sounds fun. 

Because I said so!

Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!

Why? What's the matter with him?

Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 

Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup. 

Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.

No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!

Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.

Raaaawr! 

Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks!

What did you say?!

Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!

We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! 

Huh? Nothing.

Just get out of here! 

No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!

Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!

Courics...

Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!

If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.

And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important.

Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 

Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.

A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!

Sharon?

I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.

Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.

Yeah, she's a hot victim. 

"Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers." Alright.  "Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..."  "slow-growing and can take years to develop." Dammit.  "Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive." Oh this is good. "There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?

There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!

Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?

Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! 

I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.

He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.

WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!

When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.

And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.

Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle. 

Hey, see you Nelson.

I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.

Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.

I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 

No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!

How. You won't have Internet. 

Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!

The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.

Well, of course we wouldn't.

Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!

When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!

How's it feel to be 102, paps?

Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?

Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.

Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! 

That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!

He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.

Okay. 

So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?

Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. 

Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!

Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!

Really? So we can't say ***?

No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! 

Uh, girls, we... have some bad news.

Well...

Well, thanks. 

Wasn't that great, son?

Oh my God! 

Ohhhh... 

Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?

Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.

Stan, you're behaving like a kid!

Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!

Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?

Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.

New girlfriend?

Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.

No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?!

I think he's pretty scared alright.

Not yet. It's only a matter of time.

Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.

What's he doing?

Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.

I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?

Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. 

Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?

Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.

Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. 

...Yeah.

Okay, is everyone ready to go?

What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing.

Yeah I'll bet. 

It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.

Where did you get that kind of money??

Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.

Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, 

Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!

Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 

I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 

Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.  All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. Whew, that was hard.

Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit?  Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-Shu-Sharon? 

Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!

Whoa, no way!

Oh dear.

Sharon! Marsh!

Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. 

That's my son, you bastard!

I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.

Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.

Oh?

Awhuh. 

One more thing?  Ooooyeah... 

Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 

We have a hundred ounces of silver. 

You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.

JUST GET THE GUN!! 

Yeah it's good!

I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.

Don't be a fag!  Come on! We can make it!  We have to try!

Ahhh...

That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.

Thought we wouldn't find out??? 

You can't help him!

You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?

Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?

P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff.

What about emphysema?? Is that cool?? 

They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!

Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.

Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!

You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!

AAAW!! 

You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!

I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.

I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?

Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?

Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 

Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!

Huh?

Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!

Oh really?!

Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 

Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 

Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!

Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! 

You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?

No, son. We... like to sleep in.

She's WHAT?!

Well how about four?

People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh! 

Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.

Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.

How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! 

Biggie Smalls?

Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!

Well, thanks. Uh...

What?

Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.

Uuuh, do you want your pants back?

This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.

Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...

Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!

Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.

"Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."

I don't know.

Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!

We know!

Hey eses.

Exactly. 

Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance?

No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!

Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.

Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!

Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!

This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!

You want me to kiss your-

My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.

...the women all left...

Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!

Hey Bat Dad!  I didn't hear no bell.

Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.

Who are the Harrisons?

Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 

That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.

No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.

Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.

Oh, what a fighter.

Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.

Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!

I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.

Right, Starbucks!

Will he be okay out of the hospital?

Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.

Look what your old man made.

No. I didn't. 

I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"

Nyugh!

Oh my God. I've gotta help him! 

What?!

I don't know.

Augh!

Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 

But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.

Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you. 

Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.

Yeah. That, that was me.

Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go.

Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?

What brah?! What brah?!

Marsh.

What is it?

One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!

I know that, okay?!

No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 

Jesus Christ!

Nuh uh.

Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.

Nice to meet you.

Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.

No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! 

Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.

People from Jersey?

They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. 

Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 

Bohh-riiing.

THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  SHIT!! 

America is back!
America is back!

Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--

I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.

You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.

Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 

Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.

Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!

I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.

Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?

Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?

And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?

Wait...

Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!

A holiday special. Oh my God.

You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!

You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!

Well, I guess that settles that.

Cure... cure disease. STAN!!

Alright men, fire! 

That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.

How do you know?!

Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!

I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!

And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...

Those are cherry! Ich!

Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.

See ya, son. 

Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.

Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!

Vaginitis?

What do you wanna do, huh? 

Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!

Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.

He's homeless now. We aren't safe.

We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-

Stan, our son?

We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! 

Please I, I don't want any trouble.

There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!

What is it, son?

Okay, well well, let's go look--

What do we want?

The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!

Not one more good person dies on my watch! 

What are you gaywads doin'?

Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!

Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready?

I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.

Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?

You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? 

I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.

How can you do this to people?

All right, come on! 

You didn't realize! What are "Canadian coins"?

Okay. 

I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!  Oh crap.

Oh Glen! We made it!

I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. 

Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE 

It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 

Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!

One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.

Every time?

...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.

Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?

No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.

Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh?

Yes?

Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.

Yeeaahh! 

You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.

Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!

Huh?

Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!

Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers.

Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.

What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!

There you are!

What the hell is going on?!

Ohhh.

A Catholic boat trip? 

Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter!

Behind you!

Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!

Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in! 

Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.

All right, what the hell is going on here?!

Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go with the porno tape?

Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. 

My God...

Uhh, Stan?

They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.

What's going on?

All right all right, fine! 

Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov.

I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. 

I know! Are we watching at your house?!

Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!

What are we goin' to do, Sharon??

Now, give it to me, 'cause...

I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.

STAN?! Stan! 

Probably.

Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?

Haarrrr! 

Vehicle shell holding! 

No, sorry. 

Find another place to hide, Steve!

Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.

I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.

What is wrong with him?!

Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. 

Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. 

What?!

I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. 

Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.

Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  "Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!"  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!

Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!

Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.

The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO! 

Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.

The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!

...I'm not gonna go. 

Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! 

Sharon, have you seen Dad?

I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!

Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!

Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.

Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.

All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!

We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.

Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!

Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?

Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.

Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.

Mr. Garrison, help me!

Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah! 

I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon!

Hmmm, that gets rid of them.

I can't!

What does that mean?

What?

You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!

That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 

Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.

Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.

Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 

Ohhh this is good!

Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,

Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.

Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.

We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!

Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.

Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.

Yah, that's my cover.

Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.

Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?

No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 

Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!

What?! I specifically told him not to do that!

Puh, punching trees?

Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!

Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.

An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.

Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?

GAAAAAH!!

Thanks son.

But how can they do that?!

I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!

Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. 

Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!

It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 

People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 

What? 

Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.

Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!

Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde.

You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!

No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. 

It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.

Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!

Oh okay. 

MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!

Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon.

Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?

Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.

Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!

Okay, hang on.

Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? 

Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...

Oh, maybe it was.

No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.

Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "nigger guy".

What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?

Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!

Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!

Thanks.

Stan?  Stan?

We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. 

You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!

Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.

Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!

Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.

He's become one of them.

Yeah.

No, I-... I don't know.

Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. 

It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?

Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!

Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?

Oh, we should've seen that coming!

It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.

Uh. Please, everyone- 

Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.

Stan?? Shoot it! 

Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! 

...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. 

Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer?

Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 

Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.

Oh I feel like such an idiot.

Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!

No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!

Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.

I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.

Give me the sword.

You kind of seem shitty to me too.

This is America! This is an honest America!

Hey, why is the basement door locked? 

All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.

Aw yeah, look at that.

Uh I think I found it. 

Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?

Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.

Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grampa.

No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.

You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!

OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.

It's working!

Oh pass interference! Interference! 

Hi Bill.

It is time for us all to grow up.

Wow.

...Smalls.  No way!

Come on, hurry! 

The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!

WOOOO Obama!

Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! 

Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 

Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!

I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic.

Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 

Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!

Fine! 

I gotta get to the doctor! 

$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!

Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.

Yeah, they're all rooting for me.

No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.

Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?

Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!

Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?

Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.

I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.

An O please.

So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?

But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic.

Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.

Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  "Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn"  "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."

Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.

Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 

Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.

Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!

Jesus... we're all alone... 

What?

I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 

It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.

Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! 

The hologram's in our bedroom?

Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck.

Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?

I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.

You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!

Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.

Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.

Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.

SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.

Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! 

You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!

You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.

Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!

Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!

Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.

...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...

Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.

Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!

This guy doesn't know when to quit!

Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.

Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything.

Aaah I don't know. Why?

This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!

Just hand over the bunny, Stan!

Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?

Aw rats. 

Ooww!

Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 

Will do, officer. Will... do... 

I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!  Can you help me stop them?!

What?

Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.

Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 

How's it goin', Gerald?

AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!

Stan, poke your grandma!

Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 

Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?

Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? 

No!

I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?

Can I get a scotch and soda? 

Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.

Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!

It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!

Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. 

That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!

Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?

Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!

Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!

Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?

Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.

Nobody can build anything!!

Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!

Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.

See ya. 

Stan?

STAAAN!!

Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.

No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.

No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?

The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.

We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.

I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.

No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!

Well I don't know about ever...

I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.

Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.

OH!  Shelly! Hold on! 

Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?

Yes, it's me, Stan.

Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 

Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?

Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?

Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.

Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape?

That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!

Yeah, experiment.

Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.

No sign of anybody else.

Come on up here, everybody! 

The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 

Oh no, pull in here.

Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.

Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.

Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?

Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault.

Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.

Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.

Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.

Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.

All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.

If she means that much to you.

Come on, let's go! I'm right here!

Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.

Yeah! 

Um... Yeah yeah sure sure. 

How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?

Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.

Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!

Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! 

I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?

This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!

And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.

They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!

He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.

Butters? Is that true?

On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 

It's cool on my tongue.

He took the bell!

We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!

You know. About... God, and stuff.

We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.

Felt great?

Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?

Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!

Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 

Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. 

They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!

That's right. We need to get online.

Sharon?

Leave me alone I don't have any change!

Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!

Yeah, no, we've told you everything.

Uh sure.

Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.

Come onnn, come on!

Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!

A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 

Read what?

Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.

Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?

No, she is. 

Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.

Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.

Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!

I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.

Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!

It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 

How's it goin'? 

Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!

Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!

Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!

Oh no you're not!

What did you say to him?

I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 

Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. 

Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying "That's my son!"  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. 

Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.

Ng-oh. 

Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.

Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 

And me, I'll be the caring soul.

That's right.

...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist.

Uhh...

All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?

Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!

Unh, come on! 

And?  Your turn, Sharon.

You wanted to see me, Mayor?

My son is counting on me!

No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.

That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. 

Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah. 

He's going to vote!

Oh? Not impressed? How about this? 

All we can do is try, Harrison.

Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll.

No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. 

Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.

Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.

Okay. 

Uh - pretty sure.

Come on!

Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?

A bus! A bus is coming!

Wha?! Finland?! 

He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.

Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!

See ya. 

Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.

Geez!

Oh, that is beautiful!

Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?

Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes!

There, I think that's got it. 

Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!

We did it!

We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! 

Where?!

That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.

No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.

Christmas is ruined again! 

Yeh-hah! 

No problem, Jakov.

Or else what?

You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!

I'm so startled.

Really?

Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.

Huh! I don't have any change. 

It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.

I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 

Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 

Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. 

My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!

I don't think so, you son of a bitch! 

Wuh sure! 

Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!

Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.

So he's a homosexual. So what?

Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??

Believe what?

GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!

They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...

Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.

...Drones are spooky?

Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?

Yup. They're from Jersey alright.

Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.

What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?

Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.

Aww, fuck yeah. 

A startup company? A company that does what?

Smartasses. 

And then she does. It's a metaphor.

Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!

Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!

Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.

Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.

Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.

Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.

I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 

But... she's hot.

What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?

Okay.

Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.

We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.

Yes chef!

Wh-where's Stan?

Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.

Oh my God, you...  but... you're okay.

I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.

Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?

Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.

Huh?

Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?

Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 

How?!

Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Bzzz bzzz. 

Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!

Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!

All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.

Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.

Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!

What makes you the brauthority brah?!

You're looking ultra-fabulous.

Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 

I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?

Hell, we should get in.

This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! 

You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!

We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black! 

Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.

Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. 

All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 

Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. 

I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.

One point five?

Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!

Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...

Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.

Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?

Oh you fucking pervert!

I think he IS from the future.

Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 

Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!

Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 

Uh, kay, here we go. 

How do you think I met your mother?

Shuut up,  beer is bad for you?!

Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!

Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.

Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS!

WAH! Sharon!

Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?

That's God?

Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?

Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?

Oh cool! Okay. 

Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? 

Yeah, w-what are they?

Yeah, no, you nice going! 

Well, yeah.

Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming. 

Watching informative murder porn?

Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.

Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?

Yeah... No problem...

Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him.

Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!

I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. 

Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.

Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? 

The video sandwich?

Awww crap.

We know, Stanley. We've been watching.

Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?

You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.

I do respect you, bro!

Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.

Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!

Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?

Mayor, I might have an idea.

This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!

I mean, hello!

Oh my God. They took my jarb!!

Sup brah?!

Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.

Aw, dammit. 

We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.

I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!

You can barely even tell you have one on.

It looks like she had a heart attack.

But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.

Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.

Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?

Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!

I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.

Yeah, and you kicked ass!

You-d, you do?

And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the "nigger" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on "Wheel of Fortune", you know and... and when people call me... "nigger guy"... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 

Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo! 

Make your dick fly off?

Oh, my head.

Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! 

Aww crap!  Here, hold this! 

Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.

Hullo?

Hang on, I'm taking a crap.

Who are they? 

Okay, we've had enough!

But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! 

Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.

Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. 

Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! 

Yes.

How long do I have to stay here?!

Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather. 

Yes I know.

What?

Y-you can call me... Randy.

Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.

Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.

Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.

...Yeah... 

Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "nigger guys"? 

You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!

Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?

Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.

Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.

Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.

...Ew!

Whoa! Haha.  Yes sir!

Get in the truck! 

Sure um... Chad, is it?

Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!

Your vote still mattered.

Ohh, thanks.

Fags! 

That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.

Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?

Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?

That's our Cartman. 

No! Has she been doing anything odd?

Whoa! 

Sorry! Sorry.

Staaaaaaan!

Stan! Boys! You're safe!

If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.

Wha-what do you mean?

We got him!

Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.

Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that.

All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.

And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.

Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.

...Are those good moral values?

Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.

Hi, "nigger" guy! 

I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? 

Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!

Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?

Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. 

That felt so good!

Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 

Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.

Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 

Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans.

Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.

I can't afford DirecTV.

Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!

Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! 

Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??

Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys.

All right, go ahead and tell him.

Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous.

...I'm not a r-tard. 

Oh my God...

Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. 

Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!

It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!

Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 

Eh, it's fine with me.

Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. 

Okay. 

Hey yeah...

Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.

One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.

...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.

Well, the Union be damned!

It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!

This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.

Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.

Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?

You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again. 

I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.

Good idea.

What might be?

You ready for some hot, steamy fun?

Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.

Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?

You wanted to see me, boss?

Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.

Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.

I like the sand idea.

What?

That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.

Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!

Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 

Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.

Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-

I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?

Stan, you're an atheist now!

I do respect you, bro!

I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.

No!!  NOOO!! 

Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 

Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.

...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.

Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?! 

You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! 

No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.

Yeah. Good going, stupid!

That's IT! 

Thanks, Pat!

Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.

Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!

We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!

And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 

All right, let's not make that mistake again.

Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!

Come on, Stanley.

Jesus, this thing is worldwide? 

I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!

Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?

Staan...

My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!

Okay, no problem. Easy.

You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!

I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. 

Lynch mob! 

That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 

All right!

No, but war shouldn't be our goal.

You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.

I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.

Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.

Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?

I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.

Walk to first! Woo!

Come on, boys! 

Stanley, where the hell have you been?

Oh Sharon, you're the best. 

Well, I-

If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. 

Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers. 

Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!

I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started...

Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?

What's the matter? 

Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!

What the hell was that?!

Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 

Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!

Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.

Where's your car?

I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.

Why?

What?! Why the hell would you do that?!

Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?

No, no, no, it's not on.

Stan! What the hell did you do?!

Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.

Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.

No, we're sure.

So?

Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!

Uh that is nice! That is nice!

No, just the usual cable-company stuff.

What is it?

Uh... nothing. Go ahead.

No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.

It couldn't hurt.

Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.

Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?

The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!

Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  "Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."  Stan?

No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?

I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?

You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.

How? Call the fire department.

You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.

Burn it down! 

Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.

Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?

Yeah?

Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.

We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!

Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!

If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.

Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.

No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.

With a student? But... she's a woman.

Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!

Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! 

Stanley, they belong to him.

Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?

I don't have a son!

Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.

What was that?

Hello, Stan.

No... Nooo...

What does that mean?!

Can I help you? 

It's obvious to me, girl

Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.

Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.

All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.

No, it does NOT  sound nice!  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.

No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?

Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.

I don't know.

Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.

Did you see that?! Oh!

Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?

Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.

Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.

Yeah-hah! 

Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!

Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-

Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!

Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! 

The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made." 

We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...

Hi Carol.

All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. 

Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.

Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.

Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.

Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.

Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?

SCORE! 

'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.

Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.

Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.

I just... need some aspirin.

I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!

It's not working, Gerald.

Shelly! 

I don't really work out.

Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!

No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid! 

Well, this certainly is nice.

Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.

At least we're smart enough to know better!

Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!

Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.

And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"?

What is this? What's going on?

What did that?!  What is that thing?! 

So then it's not really ours.

All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!

Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!

More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.

Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. 

What's going on?

No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.

Oh Jesus!

Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?

Thanks Jim. 

Oh, please!

It's simple.

Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.

What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.

Yoyoyo! 

...And I left my family.

All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.

What is it?

NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO! 

Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home.

Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?

That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber! 

What? 

Yes?

What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!

What?? Why?? Why?!

Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.

Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 

That does it! 

Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 

No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.

Stan, are you okay?

Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!

Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.

Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 

We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.

But that means...

Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!

Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.

Yes?

AAAA!

Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?

KFC's gone, been replaced.

SIT... doowwwnnnn!

Why? This is my office.

Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.

I'll do no such thing!

I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!

Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 

No way!

Aaww!  Sharon?  Sharon, cuh can we go?

You wanna see it?

Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww...

Who?!

Who?

According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. 

Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.

Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!

Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang. 

And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.

Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.

Little fucking pricks. 

I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!

Oh, Jesus.

Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?

Yeah yeah.

Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 

Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.

Oh yeah. 

Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley.

Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. 

And when it gets cold it shrinks. 

Which cord is it?

What seems to be the officer, problem?

Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!

I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.

Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... 

Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?

What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.

Wacky Races?! Holy shit!

Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!

Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.

What's this? 

You can't just keep us in here!

All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.

I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.

Aw yeah?

Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!

His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.

Oh niice... Whoa... 

Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?

He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.

Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.

Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.

Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.

What the hell was that? 

Do they have Internet here?

I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.

What do you want?

Help! Help us!

You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.

God, the whole neighborhood's affected. 

I didn't snap at you.

I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.

I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the "Don't be scared"  and of course there's the-

Hello there, children!

Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.

The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. 

You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.

All right, look, we've been here for over three hours

Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself! 

BOOOO! 

Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.

Here's their van! Here's their van!

Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?

I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me.

Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! 

Get over there! Stay low! 

I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.

You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!

I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.

Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.

Rrrr!

For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. 

Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.

You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!

Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!

Oh, man, it that the IT?

Six thousand?!

City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much 

Awww! Awwww! 

They don't care. 

Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.

Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 

Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. 

What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!

Expulsion?!

Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit! 

Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.

That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.

Okay, I'll start. 

Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?

Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 

Did I?

Uh-oh.

OH! Ohoho, you bitch!  Ohohunh.

Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.

Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say "Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy."  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! "Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just "Nigger Guy".  Respect. 

What does that have to do with anything? 

Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.

Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.

Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. 

You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!

Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 

Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.

Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.

Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.

That's it. That's that the last one.

You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.

Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?

I guess... one step at a time.

Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!

We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!

Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?

What?

Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?

Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.

Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.

Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!

Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. 

If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.

The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.

Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-

Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. 

Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 

You know so little! 

Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 

Heh, yeah?

Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! 

"It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross!

Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?

We are the same, she and I.

Yeah! 

Did you turn the heat down?

No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  "Hello."  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 

A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! 

Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. 

Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!

Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!

I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.

Aw, that's ridiculous.

NetZero.

Stanley, what the hell are you doing?

This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!

Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on.  Wa-hang on, hang on. 

My huh?

Come on, Stan, you can do this! 

Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?

...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!

Alright, listen up.  The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.  It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God!

Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  It's Obamobama! 

All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.

Crème fraîche.

Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! 

Hey, back off, cunt!

Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!

When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. 

Agh! 

Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.

Stan?

Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.

We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.

You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! 

Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...

I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!

We can stand here as long as it takes. 

Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?

Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 

You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-

Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.

Jesus Christ!

My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?

It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! 

Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something.

Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!

Hey! That's not true, Stan.

Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells."

Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.

Huh? Yeah?

Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!

Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.

It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.

Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.

Right now, Stan!

Just six quarters!

Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!

We worked it out, pal. Surprise!

For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.

You guys wanna put some money on it? 

Go back, go back!!

Oh my God... That's today! 

Godspeed.

Alright... then you drive. 

Alright, alright. We surrender. 

Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.

Go on, Stanley. 

I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.

What do they want?

Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.

Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.

Stan!

What?

That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.

Yeah, how'd you know?

Gluten expohn... oh not here!

Well he's gotta see this.

Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.

Yeah, it's fuckin' money.

You...

He's got a gun!

Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!

Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?

The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go! 

Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.

Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.

Why, why would we punch trees?

Fort Collins can't play!

Well that's just a beer.

Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!

Stan, you're alive!

Quiet! Keep quiet! 

It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.

So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.

Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.

Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.

Put it out! Put it out! Fire!

It's, uh it's nothing, really.

--thing will work out.

Yeah thanks.  Asshole.

Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 

Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.

No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.

Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. 

Obama's not talkin' about you!

It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!

I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.

So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! 

So ridiculous.

I'm 19.

Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!

In here! 

Shhhhh! What are you talking about?

Truth or Dare?

At the same time.  Oh My God!

Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.

Alright babe.

Gerald. Please help us.

What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!

No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.

How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.

Oh. Wicked.

Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.

Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!

Looks like next harvest will be even better. 

We're alive?? We're alive! 

Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?

Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!

It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.

What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!

Stan? Stan?

But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. 

I can't do it! I can't do it!

Okay.  STAN!  STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!

YEAH!  YEAH! WOO!

Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!

Well at least that part's like the Internet.

Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.

Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 

Who are you?

These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 

No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.

In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?

It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah! 

Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!

Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.

Oh my God.

What is it?

Oh naggers. Of course, naggers.  Right.

Who are you people?! You aren't real!

It's yours.

Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! 

Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.

We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?

Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.

We will give you a call!

You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!

I know, I know! God!  Bleeeh! 

But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?

Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. 

No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.

Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 

Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!

Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 

I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 

No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?

Huh?

No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.

Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.

It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys.

Oh, finally! 

Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!

Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.

Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!

Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-

There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.

You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.

I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! 

I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.

Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.

You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?

But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.

Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 

Whassup brah?!

How much do we have to raise, Mayor?

Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 

That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!

Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.

Oh no, I'm way too startled!

Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?

Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.

Yeah, me too.  Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! 

Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. 

Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!

Yeah. You'd become what you hate.

Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.

That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!

Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.

You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?

Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.

Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.

Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 

Well, you know what I think, Stan?

You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!

Hey, what's that thing? 

Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!

You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.

Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?

Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!

We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?

If it means war, then we say NO!

It's beautiful!

But you said I'm totally healthy!

Yeah... awesome...

No, Dad.

Stan, we- 

Mmm, God damn. Yeah.

Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! 

Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!

I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.

Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!

Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it.

What is that supposed to mean?

No!

I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 

Ugh..! 

Exactly.

Stop playing stupid!

GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 

Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 

Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?

In Zurich?

...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud

That's it, I'm leaving! 

...and they took back my house.

God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows.

Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.

Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.

World of Warcraft! I need to play!

Oh, no she di'int. 

Eeww.

Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 

Huh? Oh, you mean, this?

You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!

Nn-Oh my God! 

Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.

Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!

Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls. 

That's great. So can I get a referral from you?

Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!

Stan Marsh!

Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.

O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 

Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!

Hey, whoa, what are you doing?

What's going on here?

Let's hear it for Gerald!

There, like that! Stop that!

Yeah.

Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.

Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?

Dare.

All right, that does it!

See?

If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.

Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!

Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 

Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?

Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!

How about twenty?

Bro'dwaaay!

What are you doing?

Shelly? Shelly?  Shelly, come on. We have to go!

I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 

Yeah...

O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.

Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!

Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.

Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 

Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.

Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever.

We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!

Fraîche.

I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 

Shelly come on!

Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.

The boys have the hottest porno ever made.

I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! 

Stan?? Stan!!

I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!

Morning, Joe, Marcus.

Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie.

Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 

Hey guys!

Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease. 

Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?

Look at it, honey. It's so big.

Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.

Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.

Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.

No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?

Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?

It's okay, it's gluten free.

Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?

Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!

Ugh, that's so unfair!

....Yeeeah.

Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.

God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! 

Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 

We've got nothing! It's just gone.

I-I don't know what to say.

Oh, is that so?

What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?

There is no other team.

All right. Now, let's get to work.

Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?

Stan?  We've found Stan! Ugh. 

All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.

Whatever.

You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?

No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.

Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs.

And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! 

...Well it is a night for experimenting.

What the hell is that?  Who put that there?

...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.

Uh... Well, uh...

Damn it, stop.  Oh!  Damm it!

Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?

Yes ah, I'm getting it now.

Come on! 

Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?

Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?

You can't be serious.

Stan!

Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.

Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.

Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.

Tween Wave?

Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.

Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.

Huh?

Oh hey, sorry boys.

Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?

NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.

What am I supposed to eat?

Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??

I gotta drive to Bailey. 

Yeah, but what's the quickest way?

We could ask Al Qaeda.
