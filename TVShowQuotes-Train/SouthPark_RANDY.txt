Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 
Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?
It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!
Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.
How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?
If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.
Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!
Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! 
Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row!
Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
Here we see a view from outside the bus.
Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
This is America! This is an honest America!
No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?
Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?
I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on.  Wa-hang on, hang on. 
No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.
How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?
They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.
I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me.
And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"?
Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!
I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-
Get back inside. We have work to do. 
Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.
Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!
Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!
I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.
But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! 
Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 
Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...
Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!
Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 
Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.
Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 
No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!
Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.
I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!
There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. 
Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! 
No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 
Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 
"Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers." Alright.  "Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..."  "slow-growing and can take years to develop." Dammit.  "Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive." Oh this is good. "There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?
Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
Well at least that part's like the Internet.
You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?
You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.
Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! 
Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. 
I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.
You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!
Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?
No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!
No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. 
I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.
It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! 
Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!
Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.
The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!
And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go.
For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. 
Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!
I know! Are we watching at your house?!
They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance.
Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.
No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.
Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!
A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! 
Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 
Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 
The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go! 
Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle. 
AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 
Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.
I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started...
Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!
My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.
I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself! 
Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 
Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault.
You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!
Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? 
I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.
Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.
Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!
Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.
We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the "no" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!
Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  "Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."  Stan?
Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!
Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 
Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
You kind of seem shitty to me too.
What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.
The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!
And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.
This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!
It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.
Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.
Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?
Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 
Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!
You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. 
Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!
See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?
Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!
More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, 
Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? 
Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
At least we're smart enough to know better!
Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.
I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.
Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!
Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am? 
Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.
I know it but I don't think I should say it.
I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 
Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?
We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel! 
Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. 
Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!
If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.
Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.
No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 
SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 
Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!
And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! 
Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 
And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. 
Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!
Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home.
No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. 
Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...
I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.
Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 
Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit?  Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-Shu-Sharon? 
Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 
Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!
Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.
But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.
Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 
Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!
Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 
Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right?
It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.
Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!
Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??
Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease. 
Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 
The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made." 
Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!
Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! 
You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!
Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 
Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!
Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.
Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. 
You guys wanna put some money on it? 
Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.
No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!
I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 
Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. 
Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!
And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the "nigger" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on "Wheel of Fortune", you know and... and when people call me... "nigger guy"... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 
Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!
A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 
Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?
Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
How do you think I met your mother?
Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!
Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.
No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.
Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.
This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! 
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 
Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.
I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.
I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.
Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.
It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 
You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.
Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.
Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 
Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. 
Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.  All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. Whew, that was hard.
That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.
Yeah, me too.  Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! 
You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!
Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.
Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? 
Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal.
Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.
Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!
You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. 
Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. 
Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. 
No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.
Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!
We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!
Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? 
Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!
That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?
Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.
We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. 
It is time for us all to grow up.
Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.
We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!
Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.
Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please to put a penny in the old man's-
No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!
Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.
Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? 
Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.
Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.
You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.
Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.
Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! 
Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. 
But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.
Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 
Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!
Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 
Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.
Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 
Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!
Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!
No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?
Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?
That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 
Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 
Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!
With all due respect, clichй dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. 
We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.
Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!
So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 
Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?
Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!
Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. 
You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic.
Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.
Uh, look, I just want to tell you that
Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-
I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 
Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! 
Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?
I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.
Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.
You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!
Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?
Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww...
Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.
No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.
Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-
I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 
Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 
Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!
Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-
When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 
Hey Bat Dad!  I didn't hear no bell.
Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck.
We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?
Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?
Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!
AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?!
Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!
Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.
Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  "Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn"  "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."
We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!
Looks like next harvest will be even better. 
Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?
There isn't enough food for more people up here!
Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." 
Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 
Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.
Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 
Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! 
It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.
No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!
He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.
Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. 
Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
All right, look, we've been here for over three hours
$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 
There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. 
No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.
Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! 
We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. 
Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.
Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!
Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! 
You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.
An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?
I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 
Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Great, thanks.  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 
We can stand here as long as it takes. 
Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?
I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.
Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.
Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.
Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!
Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?
Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 
You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? 
You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 
I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.
Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.
Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 
Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him. 
Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! 
You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.
I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 
Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?
How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 
People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh! 
Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. 
Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.
Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!
Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?
Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
Not one more good person dies on my watch! 
Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "nigger guys"? 
Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.
I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!  Oh crap.
...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 
What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!
Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?
That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.
Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.
...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!
You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! 
Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.
No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! 
I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!
WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!
I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!
No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.
Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie.
Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!
We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!
This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.
They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?
When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. 
I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.
Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!
Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.
If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.
I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! 
All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. 
I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!
Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  SHIT!! 
Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.
That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 
There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!
That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.
Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. 
Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.
Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?
The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.
The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.
Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance?
All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?
The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO! 
I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!
Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?
There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.
I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?
Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.
Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.
Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 
Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys.
Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. 
Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 
Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.
Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.
Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!
Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 
I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 
Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.
Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. 
Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!
I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! 
You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!
No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.
Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!
The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!
Is it really as bad as they say it is?
Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 
Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?
Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.
Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.
It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.
No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.
Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit! 
Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!
Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. 
City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much 
Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 
Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.
Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. 
"It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross!
Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh?
Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.
We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.
We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.
What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!
We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. 
Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?
No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 
Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! 
I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!
Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 
I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 
Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!
What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.
Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.
You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?
Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 
On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 
Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.
We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.
Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?
Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. 
City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.
Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 
Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,
Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.
Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.
Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!
You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. 
Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah! 
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.
If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. 
I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
Alright, listen up.  The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.  It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God!
Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?
Get inside! We have to close these doors! 
You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!
All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.
Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. 
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.
So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.
Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.
I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!
Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.
What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.
Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.
Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.
Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.
Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?
A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!
NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. 
Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!
Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.
Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever.
Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 
Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 
I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 
Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.
Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.
What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.
KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing.
Shelly? Shelly?  Shelly, come on. We have to go!
Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?
They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
If all your friends jumped off a cliff,  would you do that too?
Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!
Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.
Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!
What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them!
Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.
Who who did you hear is, is gay?!
"He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this- 
Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!
Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!
No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.
I don't think so, you son of a bitch! 
Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! 
The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. 
It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?
Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
If it means war, then we say NO!
This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.
Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 
Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 
We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! 
Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!
Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.
Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.
We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!
Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.
Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. 
I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!
Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real. 
I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.
You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!
Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!
Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 
Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 
I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.
Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.
I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.
Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! 
Leave me alone I don't have any change!
I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! 
Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 
That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 
We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.
Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.
What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!
Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Bzzz bzzz. 
We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! 
Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!
Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.
Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. 
Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. 
Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls. 
How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. 
Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? 
Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.
Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. 
They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs.
Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.
Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. 
A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 
All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!
Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place.
Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.
Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.
I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!
Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.
Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 
Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.
Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.
What does that have to do with anything? 
Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 
Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!
We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!
Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. 
NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
What the hell is that?  Who put that there?
Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. 
Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?
Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.
Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.
Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. 
Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.
Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.
Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. 
No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.
So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! 
Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 
What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 
Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.
Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.
Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?
Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!
Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold
Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!
That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.
No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  "Hello."  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 
Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
How long do I have to stay here?!
Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 
Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! 
I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
I just... don't think I can, all right?
Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!
No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. 
Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 
Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! 
Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power.
Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang. 
Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!  Stan?  You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! 
Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!
Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.
All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?
Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!
What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 
Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.
Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!
People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 
Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 
We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.
Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say "Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy."  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! "Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just "Nigger Guy".  Respect. 
What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! 
Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.
We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! 
You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again. 
Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.
Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. 
Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 
Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 
Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!
All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. 
Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 
Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter!
Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.
You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 
Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 
We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black! 
But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.
You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.
Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. 
Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.
Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool?
Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.
It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 
I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?
I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 
Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?
Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 
I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.
You can barely even tell you have one on.
Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!
I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!
Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 
You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.
Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 
This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 
Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 
Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!
What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.
Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. 
Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important.
Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.
How do we get our runaway children back?
What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather. 
We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!
You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-
All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person "Randy" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 
Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.
Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.
GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.
Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 
Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!
I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!
Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! "Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom." Oh, we need this! 
Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.
We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
"Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"  "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man.
Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.
HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 
Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. 
Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 
Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers. 
Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!
Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.
We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?
Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 
Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 
Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 
Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!
Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?
Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!
Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? 
No, it does NOT  sound nice!  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.
It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.
Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 
...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.
Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. 
Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
I am not chugging beer!  I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! 
What? What did I do?!  What did I do?!
Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 
I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
It looks like she had a heart attack.
I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. 
Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
Will he be okay out of the hospital?
Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?
Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys.
She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.
Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?
That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 
Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!
You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?! 
Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?
Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 
Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!
One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.
Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?
You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! 
Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! 
Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
All right, let's not make that mistake again.
That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!
...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?
The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. 
Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! 
And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 
Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!
Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.
I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!
Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying "That's my son!"  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. 
This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!
What? I thought this was a free country! 
Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?
Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.
Oh, do we have to do it right now?
Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?
It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. 
Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!
All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.
It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!
Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells."
We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.
Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.
Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!
How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!
Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!
Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. 
Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.
Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.
...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "nigger guy".
Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 
Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.
Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.
You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!
Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.
Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.
Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! 
He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. 
Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! 
Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.
You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.
Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!
I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!
If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.
This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!
You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.
Where did you get that kind of money??
Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 
Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.
I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. 
The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.
God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! 
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!
Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 
Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. 
I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"
Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.
Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. 
We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?
That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.
Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 
Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 
I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  "Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!"  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!
Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
All right, what the hell is going on here?!
This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! 
Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! 
You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! 
Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.
Aw, you people have me on camera now?
Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 
Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.
