Oh my God. I've gotta help him! 

Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.

OKAY?!

Come on, Stan.

Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?

Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!

Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.

Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?

Thought we wouldn't find out??? 

Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.

Cure... cure disease. STAN!!

Right.

...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?

Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.

Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?

Uh sure.

Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.

Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. 

Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.

What?

I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers!

Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.

Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?

What was that?

Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!

Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!

Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.

Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?

Well, the Union be damned!

No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.

All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.

Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!

We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!

Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!

No, she is. 

Stan! 

But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic.

Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.

Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? 

You didn't realize! What are "Canadian coins"?

But then, does it still count?

All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. 

So then it's not really ours.

Well he's gotta see this.

I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!

Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 

Uh, look, I just want to tell you that

I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!

I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!

I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work!  There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!

City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.

Who are you people?! You aren't real!

What the hell was that? 

Whoa, no way!

I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?

Aah ahhh aha ahhh.

Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.

All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.

Okay, is everyone ready to go?

Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-

Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?

Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 

One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.

There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.

We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.

Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!

Stan! What the hell did you do?!

Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...

I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special!  Can you help me stop them?!

Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?

Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?

Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. 

I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.

I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!

Yes chef!

With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.

Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!

I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.

No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!

How's it goin'? 

Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.

Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.

You want me to kick your ass right here?! 

Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. 

Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 

Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?

Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?

The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 

It's, it's working!

Exactly.

Oh. You. You don't?

Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!

That's God?

A television! 

Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.

All right!

What is that supposed to mean?

If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.

Mr. Garrison, help me!

Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! 

Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.

There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?

Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?

Stan??

Hey eses.

Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.

HAAA! 

Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!

How?!

Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter!

Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. 

Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel! 

Sorry! Sorry.

You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!

"Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."

Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? 

Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!

You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.

I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. 

Hey yeah...

Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! 

So ridiculous.

And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...

Hey, Mr. Nelson.

Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.

Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?

Oh my God.

Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!

Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home.

Uh... a disease?

Huh?

Yes Dad.

Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous.

I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.

More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.

Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  "Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn"  "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."

The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.

Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.

Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!

Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.

That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.

Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 

Okay, well well, let's go look--

It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?

No!

SCORE! 

Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck.

I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!  Oh crap.

It couldn't hurt.

What does that mean?!

How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?

Give me the sword.

What brah?! What brah?!

Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!

Well what are we waiting for?

The boys have the hottest porno ever made.

Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?

Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 

The hologram's in our bedroom?

Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!

I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.

Hi Bill.

Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. 

Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.

Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.

Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!

Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.

Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 

What?! I specifically told him not to do that!

Stan, you're an atheist now!

Oh my God...

...Right, right right.

...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?

Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?

Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying "That's my son!"  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. 

Sure will be nice. 

Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.

Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!

Here we see a view from outside the bus.

I know, I know! God!  Bleeeh! 

With what?  With what? 

Yeah... No problem...

If we have to! Siddown Glen!

Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. 

We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.

I gotta drive to Bailey. 

Take the shot!! Take the shot!!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!

I said get me in there!

Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!

--thing will work out.

No! That was a copy of me!

Come on, boys! 

City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much 

You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!

Aww, stupid commercials.

All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!

This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.

I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.

I just... don't think I can, all right?

What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!

Oh, maybe it was.

Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!

When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. 

Get back inside. We have work to do. 

Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming.

They don't care. 

It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! 

You're looking ultra-fabulous.

I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.

Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!

It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.

No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!

Just six quarters!

Why?

Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE 

Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 

I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 

Sta-ogh. Ugh! 

We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-

Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.

Bro'dwaaay!

Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?

Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.

I know that, okay?!

You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place.

See ya. 

Hey Bat Dad!  I didn't hear no bell.

I don't think so, you son of a bitch! 

I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!

Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?

All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!

See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.

Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!

Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?

Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?

That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 

You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! 

Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.

Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. 

Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.

Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.

Nice to meet you.

We are the same, she and I.

I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.

Sup brah?!

Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.

In my jeans?

All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.

Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 

Oooooo.

How? Call the fire department.

Uh-oh.

Ooof. 

Alright babe.

No, son. We... like to sleep in.

If it means war, then we say NO!

Stan?? Stan!!

...Well it is a night for experimenting.

What?! 

You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!

Let 'em be pissed off, then!

How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.

Ogh, I already did.

Go back, go back!!

Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?

Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.

Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!

Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.

Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.

Well, yeah.

Now your vote didn't matter.

Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.

Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 

Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!

Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.

I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the "Don't be scared"  and of course there's the-

You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!

I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!

Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!

Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!

GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!

We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! 

Really??

They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!

We did it!

I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.

Here he comes! 

Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.

His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.

And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.

Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys.

Sharon, have you seen Dad?

No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?

Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.

Hello?

Okay. What's Shelly doing?

Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.

WAH! Sharon!

Aaaah!  Yeaaah... &lt;/&gt;

What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?

What is it?

Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!

I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!

Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.

Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 

Wait...

All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*

Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.

Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww...

Wooo, change.

Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 

Come on Stanley, let's go. 

Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 

Huh? Yeah?

Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.

Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 

Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.

Well, you're about to be.

Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!

I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.

Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!

All right, that does it!

Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!

Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?

Yours? What?

Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.

If she means that much to you.

You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.

Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!

If all your friends jumped off a cliff,  would you do that too?

Heh, yeah?

He's got a gun!

Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital. 

Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole!

Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 

Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! 

Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.

Sharon? Sharon!

Let's just get out of here. 

Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?

The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!

You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.

Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.

Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.

Expulsion?!

Hm. Really?

Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 

I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.

Staaaan? 

Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?

Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah! 

Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!

Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!

Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.

Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 

Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!

I'm...  I'm not ready...

I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.

You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!

You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!

Oh. 

We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.

Yeah...

This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.

No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof.

This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!

It's, uh it's nothing, really.

Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.

You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!

S-stan. STAAAN!

Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.

I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! 

Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?

Christmas is ruined again! 

A Catholic boat trip? 

Shelly? Shelly?  Shelly, come on. We have to go!

No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.

What?

...Ew!

Shhhhh! What are you talking about?

THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  SHIT!! 

Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!

Fine! 

Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!

It wasn't bigger than mine was.

Yeah.

What do you want?

Hell, we should get in.

It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?

Oh really?!

Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.

Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! 

Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?

Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.

Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.

This is America! This is an honest America!

Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer.

We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.

Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!

Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.

Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.

WOOOO Obama!

I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. 

Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself! 

BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!

According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. 

How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.

Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 

Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.

What brah?!

We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!

You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?

Yeah thanks.  Asshole.

Oh my God...

Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!

Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!

No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.

Oh really? About... about what?

Stan! Boys! You're safe!

Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!

Oh hey, sorry boys.

Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.

Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.

Good call, ref! Good call!

Not one more good person dies on my watch! 

Oh, do we have to do it right now?

Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 

Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...

I know where it is! 

Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.

Who are you?

And?  Your turn, Sharon.

Four point four inches...

You mean it? I'm not gay?

Yeah.  But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.

Hey, why is the basement door locked? 

No! 

Yahtzee!

GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!

Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.

Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?

Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--

Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!

Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?

Yeah. Good going, stupid!

You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!

Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.

Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.

How's your... mother?

Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!

No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.

What was that?? 

Yeah. That, that was me.

What are you gaywads doin'?

Jimmy! Jimmy!  Where did the boys go with the porno tape?

Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!

Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!

Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...

Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.

Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.

Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.

Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.

No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.

Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.

Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!

Smartasses. 

We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.

Um... Yeah yeah sure sure. 

To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.

In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?

Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row!

But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. 

That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 

It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!

Yeah, but what's the quickest way?

It's obvious to me, girl

Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!

Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. 

Aw, suck it! All o'ya!

Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! "Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom." Oh, we need this! 

Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.

No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.

No way!

No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?

She's WHAT?!

This guy doesn't know when to quit!

You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!

You won't make it through, Gerald! 

And we want-

Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 

Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!

Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!

Boys! Boys!

Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-

Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!

I would need a lot of help.

Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.

Oh you fucking pervert!

Yeah, no, we've told you everything.

What is wrong with him?!

They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!

Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.

What do you want?

Please I, I don't want any trouble.

What's the matter? 

Haarrrr! 

Oh! Yes! 

Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.

Ey, that sounds fun. 

Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!

Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "nigger guy".

Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.

You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.

Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the "no" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!

Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!

At least we're smart enough to know better!

And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!

Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 

Uhh...

Oh, man, it that the IT?

Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?

Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?

The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.

Oh, no she di'int. 

Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-

Shuut up,  beer is bad for you?!

"He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this- 

Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.

Stan?

I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 

You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.

Okay.  STAN!  STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!

At the same time.  Oh My God!

Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.

We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.

O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.

This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.

Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?

Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.

Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!

Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?

Bi kute.

Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?

Stan?  We've found Stan! Ugh. 

What's he doing?

How's it feel to be 102, paps?

Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?

I-I don't know what to say.

Huh? Oh, you mean, this?

Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. 

Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! 

He's going to vote!

Who are they? 

All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 

All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.

Stan, are you okay?

Thank you Gerald. 

Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!

What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them!

Hmmm, that gets rid of them.

That's right. We need to get online.

Because I said so!

In Zurich?

If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.

Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.

I know, right?

Oh no! Oho oho. 

...I don't get it.

Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.

You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!

Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!

Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.

Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!

I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.

See ya, Mr. Grazier. 

You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!

Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.

I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.

I was told to!

Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault.

It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly!

Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.

What the hell was that?!

You wanna go watch?

Did you see that?! Oh!

Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!

Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 

That's better.

Well I think that there's a uh...

My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!

Give me a second, would you?

I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?

We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.

Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!

I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon!

Oh my God, it's on fire! 

I just... need some aspirin.

Ohhh.

Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!

No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.

Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle. 

Okay, okay. 

Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.

Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. 

Sharon! Marsh!

Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!

Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.

Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. 

Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.

Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?

Whoa! Haha.  Yes sir!

We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars!  On thirty one black! 

Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?

Well, you never know. Maybe--

It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.

We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! 

Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!

It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.

No it doesn't.

Yeeaahh!

That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 

Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.

Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!

No, just the usual cable-company stuff.

I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!

Make your dick fly off?

Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?

Truth or Dare?

Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! 

O ba ma! O ba ma!

I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!

Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!

I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?

Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. 

Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! 

Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 

Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.

How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!

Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!

Yup. They're from Jersey alright.

I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison."  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! 

What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?

No, it does NOT  sound nice!  Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.

That's right.

Hullo?

Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll.

So you boys like this music, huh?

And then she does. It's a metaphor.

Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.

A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 

Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. 

Ugh, that's so unfair!

You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!

Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right?

Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?

And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.

Dare.

It's beautiful!

Mmm, God damn. Yeah.

Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever.

Hey, whoa, what are you doing?

Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?

...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.

Oh, Stan! 

Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!

New girlfriend?

Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!

You wanna see it?

My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.

We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.

Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang. 

Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!

No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  "Hello."  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 

It was... a trick?

Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.

Whoa! 

Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?

Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! 

Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!

You-d, you do?

No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.

Jesus, it's statewide.

We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?

Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?

Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. 

I respect you, bro!

Yeah, experiment.

Huh?

The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.

Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?

It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 

Stan!

Heeey!

WAAAH!

I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!

Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.

Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?

Awhuh. 

Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.

Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. 

They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.

What?

Jamie Oliver!

Oh no, I'm way too startled!

No, we're sure.

Are you crazy?

Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!

Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.

And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?

No??

Yeah, I got lube right here.

It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.

...Hey, you didn't get beeped.

I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 

You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 

Uh, girls, we... have some bad news.

The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!

Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!

That's right, yep, you're the first ones.

Stan...

Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 

Get back to your room, Shelly! 

The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!

Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks!

Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?

A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal.

Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!

Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?

What about emphysema?? Is that cool?? 

Staaan! 

All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.

Huh?

Stan? Stan?

It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!

Marsh.

I know it's not a real ticket!!

Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.

No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.

Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.

Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.

Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!

Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.

Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.

Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!

Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!

Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?

Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.

What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?

Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. 

Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.

Yeah, and you kicked ass!

Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??

KFC's gone, been replaced.

All right? Stan? Okay?

This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 

I do respect you, bro!

All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.

Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. 

It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!

Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.

Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!

Yes I do, yes I do.

The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO! 

Ng-oh. 

Yes?

NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!

Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.

Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!

Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.

Ow! That hurt!

Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!

Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 

Stan?

I love you too babe.  OH!

It's okay, it's gluten free.

"It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross!

Aw rats. 

Oh my God.

Ohhh, never mind. 

Stop playing stupid!

How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?

Let's hear it for Gerald!

Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.

...And I left my family.

One more thing?  Ooooyeah... 

Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.

No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid! 

Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.

It's not working, Gerald.

Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person "Randy" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 

Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.

I gotta get to the doctor! 

I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?

Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.

Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 

The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.

Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!

Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!

I'm a geologist! 

Just trying to leave without being rude.

Yeah. You'd become what you hate.

Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.

Your vote still mattered.

You kind of seem shitty to me too.

No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.

What are you doing?

Staan...

Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.

Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.

Oh, no.

Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. 

It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.

I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.

We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.

Uh, look, Mr....

Well, Stan, it's not really our-

All right, go ahead and tell him.

What?

What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!

O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 

That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!

Okay, hang on.

That's IT! 

Oh Sharon, you're the best. 

It looks like she had a heart attack.

They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.

No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. 

Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.

Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 

Right right. Does vodka count?

That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 

All we can do is try, Harrison.

Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?

Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.

Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! 

It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?

Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please to put a penny in the old man's-

A startup company? A company that does what?

People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh! 

You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.

They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!

I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.

What happened to him?

We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.

Oh my God.

Stan?  Stan?

Well, of course we wouldn't.

Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!

Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance?

Well, thanks. 

My God, you're right.

That's... tricky...

Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.

Pfft! That's none's the cool.

My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!

Vaginitis?

We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...

I am not chugging beer!  I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! 

Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?

Ahhh.

Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!

Oh cool! Okay. 

...I'm not gonna go. 

I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.

What might be?

Well at least that part's like the Internet.

Dad, what are you doing??

What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing.

Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!

No problem, Jakov.

Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.

Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.

Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  "Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!"  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!

What am I supposed to eat?

No, sorry. 

Oooo! Booom!

Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?

I'm the... only scientist in town.

Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.

No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.

Aww, fuck yeah. 

Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.

Yeah-hah! 

Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.

I'm getting in for a while, too.  Geronimo!

No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 

Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.

Why? This is my office.

NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.

What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!

Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!

Wha?! Finland?! 

What's going on?

Watching informative murder porn?

If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.

Come on!  Or maybe I'll have three beers. 

Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 

No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.

I'll do no such thing!

I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?

Now, give it to me, 'cause...

Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!

Check.

I like the sand idea.

A bus! A bus is coming!

You really did a nice job, Eric. 

Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...

Hello?  Hey, come out of there!

Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!

No, I-... I don't know.

That's our Cartman. 

You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.

Get in the truck! 

They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance.

That felt so good!

I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.

We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. 

I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 

We're out of s'more schnapps?

You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!

And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 

Hey, back off, cunt!

Where is Stan?

Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 

How much do we have to raise, Mayor?

That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.

Walk to first! Woo!

Stan?

Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit! 

Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!

Oh, that is beautiful!

Just hand over the bunny, Stan!

When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!

Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.

Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming. 

Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...

Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.

Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.

And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 

I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? 

I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 

Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 

Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!

Doctor?

Okay...

This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! 

Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!

Alright men, fire! 

...Drones are spooky?

I guess it was pretty big.

Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.

Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!

Biggie Smalls?

Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?

No! That is not the way we're remembering it!

Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?

Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.

Put it out! Put it out! Fire!

Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.

Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?

Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?

Wow. 

I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.

Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers.

Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 

We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.

Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! 

Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!

What? 

No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.

P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff.

You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!

Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse.  Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.

...Yeah. I do.

Oh yeah, good one! 

Stan, you're alive!

No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! 

Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.

See ya. 

Uh. Please, everyone- 

Damn it! How come you're not combusting? 

Crème fraîche.

Oh, yeah. 

I don't have a son!

Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Bzzz bzzz. 

Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.

We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?

Huh? Nothing.

And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. 

Ugh..! 

Yes I know.

Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!

Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!

I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.

Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta.

Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.

Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!

But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-

Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?

Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.

Aw, you people have me on camera now?

Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real. 

Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.

No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.

That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 

Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?

Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!

Whatever.

Okay.

We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!

Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. 

I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!

Aw, that's ridiculous.

This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!

Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.

Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!

Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?

Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?

Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?

Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?

Gerald. Please help us.

There you are!

There, like that! Stop that!

Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?

NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!

Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.

Unh, come on! 

Oh, brother. 

Those are cherry! Ich!

The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?

Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape?

Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!

Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!

Dammit!

Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.

Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!

Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!

Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!

Waaah!  Awwww!  Stay away!  Stay awayhay!

Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.

Lynch mob! 

All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.

Why? What's the matter with him?

They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. 

I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.

Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go.

Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.

Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.

Stanley, they belong to him.

The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.

I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle.

...Are those good moral values?

Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter!

I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 

Yah, that's my cover.

Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!

This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!

Right here, brah! 

Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.

I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.

Yes I can! Yes I can! 

Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!

YEAH!  YEAH! WOO!

Noh uh.

Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.

Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.

All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!

Punched his trees, huh?

This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!

Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 

Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 

But how can they do that?!

What is it, son?

What? I thought this was a free country! 

You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!

Agh! 

Oh my God... That's today! 

What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! 

WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!

AAAA!

...Smalls.  No way!

Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? 

Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.

Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!

...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.

Right now, Stan!

The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!

No!!  NOOO!! 

Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.

Huh?

Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 

Hi. Corey Lanskin?

So is there Internet here?

How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?

Yeah?

Hey!

I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 

Who?

You got served? By who?

Hamburger Helper?

No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!

Can I, can I see it?

Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.

There isn't enough food for more people up here!

I'm going to die!

...Yeah.

Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.

Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.

Fuck you! 

Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...

Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.

Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.

BOOOO! 

Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!

Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.

Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells."

We don't have any change! Go away!

What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?

No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.

Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.

Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?

Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!

Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 

Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!

What do you wanna do, huh? 

We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.

Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 

Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 

"Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers." Alright.  "Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..."  "slow-growing and can take years to develop." Dammit.  "Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive." Oh this is good. "There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?

Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!

The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made." 

Oh, what a fighter.

Not much, sup with you guys?

Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.

Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?

Aw, dammit. 

All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.

Quiet on set, please.

What do we want?

Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?

Alright son! Yeah!!

He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.

OH!  Shelly! Hold on! 

Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?

Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!

Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.

Oh okay. 

Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.

Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.

And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.

You wanted to see me, Mayor?

And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the "nigger" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on "Wheel of Fortune", you know and... and when people call me... "nigger guy"... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 

WHERE?!

It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 

All right, time to win some money!

Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes!

I didn't snap at you.

You guys wanna put some money on it? 

Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.

I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?

You get in the truck right now! 

So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! 

Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready?

The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! 

You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?

No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!

Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.

You did it, son! You did it!

Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.

Ohhhh... 

There is no other team.

It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.

Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!

All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.

Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?

Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.

Yeah, she's a hot victim. 

I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.

Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.

NetZero.

Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?

It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.

What did you say?!

No!

Okay. 

Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.

You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.

Vehicle shell holding! 

Oh niice... Whoa... 

An O please.

Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him. 

Who are the Harrisons?

Oh, shi- 

Okay. 

Stan, our son?

Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.

You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.

RUN! 

ЎPueblo, no bueno! ЎPueblo es muy mal! 

Stanley, where the hell have you been?

Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!

$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!

Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.

We're going back to the pile.

Sorry sorry, that's me.  Hello?

Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.

Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!

Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.

I'm going to Beaverton.

Hey! That's not true, Stan.

Oh my Gohhhd!

But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.

You ready for some hot, steamy fun?

Alright... then you drive. 

I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.

Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. 

Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!

Burn it down! 

Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?

Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 

I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game.  This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.

Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.

Ohhh.

No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!

Why can't you ever just support me?!

No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?!

You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!

Thanks son.

No, what happened?

Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?

No! I think I might have it.

It's yours.

Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 

Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!

Stan... 

And me, I'll be the caring soul.

Where do we want them?

No!

Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease. 

That's it. That's that the last one.

Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 

Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!

Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!

Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.

Not now, Stanley. 

There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.

Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.

Jesus Christ!

Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?

Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that.

No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.

Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.

You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?

Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.

The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.

Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?

No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.

Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. 

I know! Are we watching at your house?!

There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!

I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 

Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?

Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.

Fags! 

Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.

I'm so startled.

Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.

Oh my God, you...  but... you're okay.

All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. 

No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.

Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 

Hey, what's that thing? 

No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.

That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!

Eeww.

Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.

Sharon?

Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.

You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.

Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.

No! Nobody's is!

Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.

What makes you the brauthority brah?!

Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...

Subliminal messages?

Stan Marsh!

Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.

What is it?

He took the bell!

Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. 

Well, no, no, I just-

I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!

No. I didn't. 

What?? Why?? Why?!

Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?!

But... But this is real.

Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?

Wuh sure! 

A ladder to heaven? Why, son?

Is it really as bad as they say it is?

Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?

Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 

Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!

Morning, Joe, Marcus.

What? What did I do?!  What did I do?!

We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.

We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.

Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.

Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!

I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!

...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...

Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him.

I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!

Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.

I do respect you, bro!

Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.

Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! 

No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?

Yeah!

Find another place to hide, Steve!

Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. 

It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.

So?

Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!

That thing is famous? Why?

Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! 

Oh? Not impressed? How about this? 

Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!

Yes, Freemium gaming.

SIT... doowwwnnnn!

But, w-we're still selling records, right?

How do we get our runaway children back?

America is back!
America is back!

But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.

Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?! 

Get inside! We have to close these doors! 

Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.

It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.

The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.

Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?

Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. 

There's nothing to talk about.

Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?

Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?

Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.

Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!

Wacky Races?! Holy shit!

Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!

Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 

Well...

I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. 

Hi, "nigger" guy! 

Ooww!

Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?

You're the new scout leader?

I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. 

Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!

Stan?? Shoot it! 

No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.

Nuh uh.

Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!

All right, come on! 

Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!

Hello there, children!

Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!

Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.

Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! 

Yeah, they're all rooting for me.

You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!

In here! 

Butters? Is that true?

That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.

Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  It's Obamobama! 

Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?

Aw yeah, look at that.

I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.

I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.

Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!

Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!

Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something.

Can I help you? 

I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?

Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.

Huh?

Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything.

Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.

It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!

Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!

Nobody can build anything!!

It's simple.

All right. Now, let's get to work.

Damn it, stop.  Oh!  Damm it!

Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!

Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!

Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! 

Well, this certainly is nice.

Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup. 

Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!

Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?

Tween Wave?

Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool?

Who?!

So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?

Really? So we can't say ***?

...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver.  I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. 

Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 

Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.

What do we want?

I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.

What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!

Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.

Okay! 

Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.

Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.

Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.

He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.

Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. 

He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!

You can barely even tell you have one on.

Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.

Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!

Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.

Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 

Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.

Or else what?

Huh! I don't have any change. 

I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.

I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"

Oh no you're not!

Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.

All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 

Well, you know what I think, Stan?

You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! 

Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 

Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?

Sharon?

Thanks.

Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. 

Yeah... awesome...

What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!

Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.

Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.

Will you relax, Stan? 

Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??

My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!

Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.

You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!

They let you stay for free?

You...

Mayor, I might have an idea.

Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?

Why, why would we punch trees?

Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS!

I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.

Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!

No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. 

I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.

I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.

Awww! Awwww! 

Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? 

Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in! 

What does that have to do with anything? 

Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?

What's going on here?

Yeah?

Godspeed.

You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!

Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.

Stan!

Uh oh! 

...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud

Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! 

What?

I can't afford DirecTV.

Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.

Do you still love me?

Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! 

...Yeah... 

That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.

Stan, you're behaving like a kid!

We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. 

We will give you a call!

Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?

Wasn't that great, son?

I had everything. A huge house,  and all the women you can imagine.  And then one day, just as quick as it started...

Uh, kay, here we go. 

Stan! 

Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.

How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! 

There, I think that's got it. 

Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?

Augh!

What's this? 

How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!

Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... 

I worked all day! I can watch what I want!

Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.

We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?

Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.

I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!

Quiet! Keep quiet! 

What?

We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!

Ohhh this is good!

I don't really work out.

Do they have Internet here?

Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?

Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!

Yeah I'll bet. 

Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.

Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?

Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.

Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!

Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 

Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?

All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.

Okay, I'll start. 

Y-you can call me... Randy.

He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.

Oh dammit!

Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?

SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.

That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. 

We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. 

No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. 

All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!

Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!

I'm a geologist!

Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!

Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!

Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.

No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.

Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! 

My son is counting on me!

Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. 

Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you. 

I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!

Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!

KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!

What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.

Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.

Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.

Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. 

God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! 

Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...

Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.

You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! 

You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.

I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.

There's more to life than profits!

Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?

Exactly. 

What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.

Okay. 

I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 

Honey! Honey, come quick!

Where do we want them?

Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh?

No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!

Stan, poke your grandma!

Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!

Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!

Courics...

Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 

How's it goin', Gerald?

Hello, Stan.

Sorry folks, just one second here.

Yeah, me too.  Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! 

Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. 

She's too young for that stuff!

What are we goin' to do, Sharon??

Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.

I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.

What?

Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 

Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.

No! Has she been doing anything odd?

Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah. 

You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again. 

Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?

What is that?

You don't understand the issues, Sharon!

Come on up here, everybody! 

Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 

Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.

Isn't this great food?

What did you say to him?

Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.

We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!

It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?

Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. 

A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 

Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.

Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!

Hellooo family!  Who wants champagne? 

OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.

Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.

Where's your car?

I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!

Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.

Uh I think I found it. 

Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.

AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?!

Hang on, I'm taking a crap.

Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power.

Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.

I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!

Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.

Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.

No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!

Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?

What?

Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.

Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.

Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!

Uuuh, do you want your pants back?

...and they took back my house.

Come onnn, come on!

We worked it out, pal. Surprise!

Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 

I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.

Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.

But you said I'm totally healthy!

Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!

She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.

The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go! 

Oh yeah. 

Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!

Get over there! Stay low! 

He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.

Hey guys, Finland's dead.

You wanted to see me, boss?

Wow!

Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 

Well that's just a beer.

Hey guys!

Good idea.

Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.

Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.

Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-

Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!

Six thousand?!

Behind you!

But... she's hot.

Sure um... Chad, is it?

Come on, Stan, you can do this! 

Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?!

So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.

Yeeaahh! 

Shelly! 

Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 

Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! 

Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.

Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!

Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.

Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.

Wow.

Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me.

That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber! 

Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls. 

An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.

Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.

We can stand here as long as it takes. 

That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!

There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!

Looks like next harvest will be even better. 

No.

Oh, Jesus.

Stan?  Stan!

I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 

But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?

Oh no, pull in here.

You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?

Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.

You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.

Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?

Staaaaaaan!

Well, I guess that settles that.

Yeah it's good!

Uhh, yes, Officer?

You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!

I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic.

Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.

Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say "Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy."  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! "Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just "Nigger Guy".  Respect. 

Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.

Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs.

Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?

Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.

Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?

Every time?

Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.

Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?

Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.

Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!

It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!

No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.

A whole year?

Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!

Oh, please!

Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.

Leave me alone I don't have any change!

It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! 

Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!

Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. 

What are you talking about?

Oh naggers. Of course, naggers.  Right.

People from Jersey?

Gluten expohn... oh not here!

Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it.

Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.

Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!

What?

No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?

Well, I-

Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?

STAAAN!!

Did I?

I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.

Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?

Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.

You can't help him!

Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.

Come on! 

Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. 

Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.

Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.

That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.

Who is it, Sharon?

Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?

It is time for us all to grow up.

...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.

A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!

Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo! 

Thanks, Pat!

I can't do it! I can't do it!

Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 

Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?

Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?

Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.

I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?

Which cord is it?

Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. 

Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.

We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! 

And when it gets cold it shrinks. 

Little fucking pricks. 

Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on.  Wa-hang on, hang on. 

...the women all left...

'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.

Aw crap!

Ohh, thanks.

When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.

But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.

My huh?

Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 

Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!

Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!

Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!

Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.

No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.

What?!

So who won, Mr. Mackey?

Can I get a scotch and soda? 

Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.

Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! 

Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.

Uh - pretty sure.

Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov.

Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.

Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.

Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.

Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?

You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-

Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.

With all due respect, clichй dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. 

Hey. My eyes are up here.

NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO! 

Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! 

Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.

Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!

Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.

It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 

Sweetheart, you saw the news...

You want me to kiss your-

We're alive?? We're alive! 

Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 

No, Dad, she's dead!

Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!

Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!

Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.

Oh pass interference! Interference! 

Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!

Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.

We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?

Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?

Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!

On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 

I think he's pretty scared alright.

Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.

Not yet. It's only a matter of time.

And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.

I guess... one step at a time.

Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.

Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?

Where did you get that kind of money??

Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!

Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.

Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!

Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! 

Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 

No sign of anybody else.

Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.

Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.  Ow!

Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.

What's the matter with him?

That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.

I don't know.

Yeah, no, you nice going! 

We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.

No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 

Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.

Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.

You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate,  bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!

We've got nothing! It's just gone.

I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 

You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? 

Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?

All right all right, fine! 

Bohh-riiing.

Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!

What seems to be the officer, problem?

It's cool on my tongue.

Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.  All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. Whew, that was hard.

You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!

Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?

Alright, alright. We surrender. 

Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!

Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?

I can't!

Wull come on, that's impossible!

Rrrr!

Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.

Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.

Believe what?

Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! 

Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?

Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!

Yeah, w-what are they?

Me.

Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.

Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!

Come on, let's go! I'm right here!

Probably.

I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.

But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! 

All right, let's not make that mistake again.

Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!

It is time for a sue-ance.

That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!

Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?

Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.

Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!

Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!

Huh?

Come on!

That's our Grandpa. 

No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.

Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.

Uhh, Stan?

Really?

Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 

Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! 

Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!

What?

This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!

...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.

You're from Cirque du Cheville. 

You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.

I don't interrupt you.

Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!

Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.

Look, Glen. We're saved. 

Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.

You know. About... God, and stuff.

Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. 

We have a hundred ounces of silver. 

Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!

If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.

This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!

Oh my God! 

Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.

Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.

I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.

Uh that is nice! That is nice!

I don't know.

Oh Jesus!

Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.

Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.

One point five?

All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.

Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.

Well, thanks. Uh...

You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.

That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!

I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!

No, but war shouldn't be our goal.

Stan!

MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!

Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!

The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. 

Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!

Jesus... we're all alone... 

Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!

Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!

My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. 

... This is cum. 

Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! 

Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?

Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?

No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!

You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.

My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?

Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.

Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!

I wasn't watching food channels!

Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!

Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans.

You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!

Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan!  Stan! 

Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 

Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.

Awww crap.

We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!

Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!

Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! 

Alright, listen up.  The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.  It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God!

Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 

That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.

"Internet Porn Simulator" 

For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.

So he's a homosexual. So what?

Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!

I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry.

Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer?

What? 

Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.

Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.

Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. 

With a student? But... she's a woman.

Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!

I love Candy Crush.

Ooo, what's that?

I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.

What are they doing?  Don't leave us!

They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.

I mean, hello!

Come on, Stanley.

All right, look, we've been here for over three hours

Yoyoyo! 

We know, Stanley. We've been watching.

How painful is "painful"?

See ya, son. 

I think he IS from the future.

He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.

It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.

Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?

Now! 

You can't just keep us in here!

I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. 

I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.

D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"?

What?

Huh?

You bet.

Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?

Who who did you hear is, is gay?!

Wha-what do you mean?

We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!

And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.

He's become one of them.

...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist.

With two girls or two guys?

Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "nigger guys"? 

Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!

Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!

The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!

Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?

Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!

It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys.

What?!

Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. 

Shelly come on!

Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 

Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.

Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.

We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!

Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!

Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 

Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! 

They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...

Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.

Oh?

I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.

How do you think I met your mother?

I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.

Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?

Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!

Uh... Well, uh...

But the statue wasn't a miracle!

That makes sense.

Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!

Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.

Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.

I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!

I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.

What?! Why the hell would you do that?!

Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit?  Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else?  Shu-Shu-Sharon? 

Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 

You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!

Well I don't know about ever...

Yeah, whatever.

Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?

Geez!

Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. 

Fraîche.

Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.

But that means...

Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 

Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!

Yeah, it's fuckin' money.

ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.

Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 

What's going on?

Dammit.

It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 

Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.

Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.

No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.

Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. 

Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!

We know!

GAAAAAH!!

I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 

Just get out of here! 

Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.

You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?

Well... so... they don't really... do anything.

It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?

Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!  Stan?  You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! 

Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grampa.

That does it! 

Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 

The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. 

I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. 

Aaww!  Sharon?  Sharon, cuh can we go?

I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!

Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? 

Stan? Okay?

Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.

Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!

Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?

Felt great?

Look what your old man made.

Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.

Three minutes would be plenty.

No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!

Hey there, son.

Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. 

Jesus, this thing is worldwide? 

Yes, it's me, Stan.

And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.

Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.

Go on, Stanley. 

Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.

What'd you say?!

Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?

Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,

All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him.  Now, walk.  Do you feel hot?

Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!

Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?

Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde.

Okay, we've had enough!

What the hell is going on?!

What?

...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.

And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! 

Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.

We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.

Yeah yeah.

I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.

Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.

I just gave you change!

We could ask Al Qaeda.

You can't be serious.

JUST GET THE GUN!! 

Oh I feel like such an idiot.

You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!

A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! 

No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.

Yeah, I'm playing from the office.

Oh. Well okay, great.

They can play guitar now?

What's going on?

These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 

Shelly! 

Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.

Okay, no problem. Easy.

Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.

Oh, well that's good.

Mine... mine was bigger.

Oh dear.

Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!

Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?

Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?

My musical has lots of subtext.

A holiday special. Oh my God.

How long do I have to stay here?!

I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?

It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?

Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. 

Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather. 

How can you do this to people?

I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me.

Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.

I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 

On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 

Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.

What are you? A McCain voter?

Seven centimeters...

Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?

Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!

Hey, really??

Jesus Christ!

I don't know.

Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.

No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. 

What?

Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. 

Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. 

I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.

Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.

God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows.

What does that mean?

Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!

Stanley, what the hell are you doing?

You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?

Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!

Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.

What did that?!  What is that thing?! 

Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?

This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!

Yeh-hah! 

Our house... It has no Internet.

Staaan!

Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? 

One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax."  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.

Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!

Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 

Oh, we should've seen that coming!

What are?!

Uh... nothing. Go ahead.

Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 

No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! 

Oh my God. They took my jarb!!

Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 

Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie.

If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. 

Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!

...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?

Yeah, how'd you know?

Yeah! 

If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.

Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.

Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.

Oh My God!! 

Oh. Wicked.

Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.

Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! 

Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!

Wh-where's Stan?

Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 

Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. 

What do they want?

Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 

It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah! 

So what happened?

World of Warcraft! I need to play!

You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!

Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??

That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.

Well how about four?

Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.

Whassup brah?!

Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!

Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??

Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon.

Huh?

You need to shape up, mister.

That's great. So can I get a referral from you?

Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.

Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.

But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.

There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.

Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.

Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.

I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 

And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.

No...

AAAW!! 

Stanley, I... Skylarkings?

Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.

Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.

So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?

GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 

Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.

Okay. 

Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.

It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.

What is this? What's going on?

We got him!
