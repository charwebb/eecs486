I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
But that was my only pair of shoes.
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Michael you could put your initials in it.
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
And he can get any girl that he wants.
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
But you didn't want to start with us?
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
Then why don't you do something about it?
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
What does this mean? What does it mean!
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
I would want to live with no legs.
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
I heard they made out and had sex.
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
But I do like her just the way she is.
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
