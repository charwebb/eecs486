Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
Uh oh. She's doing it again.
That's awesome!
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
What is your type?
Jim said that?
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
[paper football lands on desk] Ooh.
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
Are those the lyrics?
Three queens.
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
And that is Dallas. [shows money]
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
Michael, that was fun.
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
What's goin' on?
Yes!
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
Why not your condo?
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
I guess I could be nicer.
An Escalade.
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
Yeah. Every single day.
One order.
Ditto.
Yes!
The debate is whether she is hot.
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
...ces. [chuckles]
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Nice! [rest of the office looks excited]
Yes!
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
45
Yep.
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
No, wait. [put on a hat] Yeah.
That seems early, even for her.
When will the new copier be ready?
What the hell?
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
It... yeah.
Michael, you're at least forty six!
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
Cool.
You are never going to find them.
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
She touched my shoulder.
Please, please. Please.
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
Wayne Johnson? The Rock?
Nice.
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
[offscreen] No, it does not!
Michael could win.
Nice! Yeah.
You were super mean.
Next stop pies!
Yeah.
No.
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
Jim said that?
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
Oooh yeah... [people chuckle] Jim and Pam!
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
Present company excluded?
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
Most of that is good.
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
My name is Kevin.
Or the me that stinks.
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
Pam's back on the market again.
We're here for the show, Michael.
Hey!
Pam. Can you vote for other people?
Booby honking.
Whoa.
Michael is that a wig?
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
Exactly.
Phillip got this for me?
Nice.
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
I���m���good.
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
Whhh... What are you guys doing?
Mine.
I don't know.
[grinning] Oh boy! What's happening?
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Well, Hol, this is it.
I'm going to call him Little Kevin.
All right.
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Oh, my God!
[looking at Oscar] Mama Bear!
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
We're not listening.
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
Our question is���it seems dumb.
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
[everyone applauding] Awesome!
How 'bout Cooper's then?
Is that all it was?
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
Mm-hmm.
What happened?
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
Michael?
I have a tambourine.
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
I am Oscar Martinez.
Michael is that scotch?
Hi.
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves]
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
Dude, you gotta believe.
You never call back.
Stacy.
Yes!
[still giggling] Tea.
Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump.
Because of how much Angela hates it.
You had me at 'Sex.'
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
No.
Ooh.
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
You've got to be kidding!
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
I do not want to talk about it.
Yes. Me do.
Well, thanks. I appreciate that.
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.
Totally. George Clooney.
[watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut?
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
[interupting] Hey Ryan, you coming?
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
Bearded man boy.
I think it should be a surprise.
Uh huh.
You would.
They have no idea what happened.
You wanna go to the beach?
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
Yes.
Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!
No. I'm still waiting.
Woah, woah [Delivery man with oversized bear]
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
Don't look at me. [smiles at camera]
Andy, are there documentary groupies?
Yes!
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
Ohh.
Set!
Michael?
I'll go to the diner with you.
He's like a better-looking Andy.
Okay. [leaves]
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Where���s the, uh, basket for gifts?
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
I know! It���s alphabetical.
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
Yeah! Tell us a story.
That is lame.
Andy, you're up, let's go!
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
[giggles] Little Kevin.
James Bond was a spy.
Four!
C' is for suspension.
Yes.
[mouthful of food] I understand.
Got that, bimbo?
Stay away from my mom.
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
But that was my only pair of shoes.
And John Wayne?
Six-six-five-zero.
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
Whoa, I'll try it.
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
Do you like Steve Miller?
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
Yeah, it won't shred magazines.
I could sing it.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
Me.
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
Okay.
Hi Jan, you look... tan.
Hello? Hey.
I think that's from Big.
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
Who's we, you and Jim?
Yeah. [everyone raises hands again]
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
[tries stapler/marker combo] Okay.
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
T minus...
[crying] At least I got chocolate.
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
I'm going to help you.
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
Hey guys it's my turn.
I'm going to!
Angela, it is a million degrees.
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
I'm in a band.
That���s totally uncool.
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
So what do we do now?
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
No way.
...unbelievable.
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
No.
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
Michael, isn't that Holly?
Oh, I bet Jim goes too.
Whoa.
Whoa.
[gasps]
Many small time make big time.
Sometimes.
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
Um, I might have skin cancer.
Hey.
Yep, yep, yep.
Oh I'm in.
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
What are you guys talking about?
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
I'm Kevin.
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
[mouths] Damn...
Oh no, that's, that's not happening.
Really, really fun.
Don���t tell me what to do!
Does and email count?
Here you go. [hands money]
Cool.
Bye.
Damn it! [banging machine]
Thank you.
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble.
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
[giggling]
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Oh, I definitely do.
Good thinking.
Yeah.
[Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
Thank you.
Cool. Bye.
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
I always set it at 69. [snickers]
Well... well damn-it.
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?
[rings bell] Les Jolies Choses.
Pam is taller.
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
What?!? No!
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
Okay, I got this one.
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
He's not my client.
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Wait a minute. Yes I am.
I insult you, Oscar.
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
You aren't curious?
My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
[shakes head no]
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis.
They were stolen?
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
What do you mean?
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this.
[to Angela] Shhhh...
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
Whoa.
What does this mean? What does it mean!
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Oh, did I win the pool?
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
[looks at Andy and giggles]
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
I can't believe we're missing that!
Yeah.
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
I just thought-
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
For birthdays!
Pam?
I've dumped better than Erin.
He is black... right? And...
Yeah.
Uh oh.
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
No.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
Me?
Nice. Nice.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
[sniffles] It���s just that I���m so emotional.
You should go to Hedonism.
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
Because... You would love it.
Okay.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
Big mistake.
Butt honking.
That's not fair.
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
She's prettier than you though.
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
I donated sperm.
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
That was a really cool move.
I'm not taking Rogaine.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
Nice.
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
Yeah.
You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
The beef is poisoned?
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
Hey Pam.
Yes!  That's what I'm talking about.
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
Come here [hugs Dwight]
I do the numbers.
Sweep the leg.
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
Wow, that's awesome!
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
Thank you.
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
We all got to go sometime.
Even I know that's weird.
There are no wrong answers.
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
Guys.
I think I should call her.
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
What does that mean?
Yeah, that���you're being really mean, Andy.
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Who's pickle?
That was so awesome.
Hot tub party?
Nice.
[spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?
I can't decide what to get.
Wow.
Federal and State.
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
Yeah.
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
Italian.
I missed you!
All-in.
Whose it from? [to Oscar]
I don���t think so.
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
I think this thing is broken.
Yeah.
Man, that thing's bigger than I am.
What is he doing?
Hi, Toby.
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
Oh, right. The state senator.
Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
No, I-
Better...
Pete what?
Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand]
Thank God.
Yeah!
That's really comfortable. [Michael gasps]
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
Good Valentine's.
[raises hand] Do we have to?
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
Can you hop?
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
It's a good idea.
Yes.
Oh, Yes!
Well, w���
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
Angela, this is inappropriate.
As would I.
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
No way!
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
Fine, fine.  I���ll talk normally.
Yeah.
All of us?
[heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming?
[running laps around the conference room] Yes!
No, under the jacket.
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
Tip-top shape.
Because of reasons...
: That sounds great.
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
Jim, put it on.
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
Then I won't let you down.
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
314 pies.
Yes!
[smiles] I like it.
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
[applauds]
Yes!
I'm on it.
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Bye, Phillip. High five.
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
Hey!
But save time. More success.
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
I wish my car had a bathroom.
I can do that.
Dammit.
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[walks in] Hi!
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Wait, you didn't give it back?
[thinks] Eleven.
When can I sit on your lap?
Well, what if you're cold?
I'm petrified.
Thank you.
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
I think he's singing.
Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes]
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
She wasn't that hot.
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
Michael, have you met the Penguin?
Congrats Phil!
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Pam, look out!
Hi.
Ni-
So���DARRYL! A GIRL!
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
Michael, you might lose your condo.
Night, Oscar.
I'm from here!
No. [chuckles]
I can't wait.
[blows a sigh of relief]
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
[empties bowl of M&M's into his mouth]
Any cat, you mean.
I wonder what he did.
Oooo.
Hooters?
I can't relax about it, you know?
I���ll take him.
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
The Penguin.
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
Oh, I'll take 'em.
I accept your decision!
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Thanks, so sweet.
They call me Kevin.
Oh yeah.
Not really.
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Good cookie.
Yeah Jim, why's it so far?
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
No, not yet.
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
Yeah, later dude.
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
Yeah, Michael, I just uh...
Your name looks really nice.
Yeah. That's pretty bad.
Wow. That is crazy.
You said she liked me.
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Nice! We got burned!
I feel scared a little.
It smelled
I almost died.
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
Yeah!
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
Kevin Malone.
What does a bean mean?
Yeah.
What else you got?
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
Dunh-duh-na-dah!
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
Call it.
That���s the winter season., three months.
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
Red gloves.
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
Nice.
You cannot make me run.
Don't eat it.
But you didn't want to start with us?
Three���
Didn't drop a single ball!
The mob.
No, it is here.
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
Oh man, this is weird!
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
[answers phone] Hello.
Pam.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
Packer, we accept. [others disagree]
Me and Pete are building a tower.
Yeah.
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
Thank.
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
Uh, the man tree puts its penis-
Another one?
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
It feels unbelievable!
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
Can I have your pencils?
Yes.
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Oh zip it.
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
[counting votes] Five. Five to five.
Later, Jim.
You did it.
Hey!
Of course.
You love your mom.
Are you serious? From Star Trek?
See world.  Oceans. Fish.  Jump. China.
Oh God.
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
Oscar.  Angela.
My money's on Pam.
Fine. [throws plane, doesn't fly]
Not anymore.
Erin, would you have lunch with me?
Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
How do you know?
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
Yes!
I think Karen has a prettier face.
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
Thank you, Michael.
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
No but that's not fair.
Ooh, can I be a pirate?
That is so good, Michael
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
Yes!
Pete...
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
You're welcome!
Interesting.
You know.
Oscar. Angela.
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
Egons.
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
Yes.  I am an accountant.
MILF!
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
Yeah, me too.
And he can get any girl that he wants.
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
Hmm...
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
We're bored a lot.
I insult you! To your face!
Cool. Superhero.
Their bread's really good.
But...
Hey, we're gonna do this...
Wh...
I'm sorry.
He got scented candles!
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
How's your fart project coming?
Nice.
[nervously stuttering] I... have... things...
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
Yeah, we can go eat pie.
[to Andy] I'm calling the meeting anyway.
Hey, Ryan.
Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
[to Michael] Is there a cookie?
Nice outfit.
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
Shh, here she comes!
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
Ooh, ooh!
Because of sex?
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
It was great to see you, Jan.
Yes.
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
We want our parking spaces back!
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
You don't know that.
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
Hey, Jo!
Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon?
Here...
That's hilarious.
Good pizza.
Nice.
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
Ohhh...
Wait, are they searching all our computers?
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
Damn it.
Thank you, Holly.
No, it's not.
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
You're wearing a woman's suit?
Open QuickTime.
Wait til' Monday.
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
Hi.
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
Reeeeally.
I wanted a cookie.
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
Guys.
Hi Pam, is Jim there?
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
Yeah.
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
Are you going to try it?
Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
I'm almost done.
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
Nice!
Who makes it?
What does a bean mean?!
It���s a answer.
Yes! Wait, why?
Are you seeing anyone right now?
Thank you.
Oh, then pick TV.
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
Damn it!
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
How about Cugino's?
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
Wait, C-R-A-Z...
Isn't it supposed to be, 'Drive safely'?
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Wait, all of them?
Nooo!
Little old man boy.
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
I remember.
Cool.
What are you doing?
I would want to live with no legs.
Hmm. Martin?
Damn it.
What is it?
Totally!
Yeah. Respect the lei.
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
Why don't you go Michael?
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
Yeah.
Are there carbs in vodka?
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
[at the same time as Dwight] Forest.
[waves] Hi.
Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
Yeah! [hugs Pam]
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
We need a warning signal.
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
Woah. [Delivery man with flowers]
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Well, why don't you shut up!
Yeah.
Hey.
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
Account...? Michael, what is going on?
Nice.
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
[muffled] I'm still enjoying  it.
Wait, why am I a racist?
Michael. [tapping on door]
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
I... did not.
Awesome!
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
[puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that?
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
Michael, did you tell your mom yet?
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
Oh, geeze.
Yeah, me too.
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
Whoo-hoo!
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
I bet you were.
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Taste test? I���m in!
Then why are there two flyers?
Oh yeah!
None taken.
[bleep] you, Gabe!
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.
Michael, I hated the twirl.
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.
What a chubbers. Whoa.
I think it's over, man.
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
[playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]
No, constantly.  Like, for
Yeah. Oh.
No no no!
Next to the IHOP?
I do. [applause] Come on everyone...
Wha-- wh--
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
No.
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
Can I get some candy, or something?
That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
Night, Pam.
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
No, no.
Boi-oi-oi-ing
Yes!
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
You own a bar?
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Hi.
Meredith, I tell you all the time.
You wanna get high?
No.
You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank...
Cool. Okay. [Pam hangs up] Bye.
Still scary.
Go.
Okay, Michael.
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
I knew it!
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
Listen, it���s important. You���ve gotta hear this.
Then see you later building.
Yeah.
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
Please, stop.
We have to.
Seriously?  You're okay with that?
Will do.
...when I thought I had skin cancer.
The fire pit is a no-brainer.
Andy.
Michael, the baby's already been born.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
[holding mobile phone up] Go.
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
[with mouth full] Yes.
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
No. I won't say it.
Yeah.
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
Y'all.
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
See world.
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
Do you have any savings?
Michael, please he--
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
Right.
What?
Long johns?  A shaw?
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
I miss Stacy.
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
Guys come on. I'm right here.
[to Oscar] What was that stuff?
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Do you think we should go ?
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
Warning! Warning! Warning!
Nnnnice. Wow!
Maybe I'm the father.
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
Um... Business!
Please, stop.
Dude, you should know.
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Oh, I bet you ask?
[nods] Hey...
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
Who would want it?
Yeah.
Yeah. This place is great.
Yea.
Oscar, talk to him.
Yeah [kisses Darryl on the cheek]
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
Yeah, women be shoppin'.
One order.
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
Huh?
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
We call it Hate Ball.
I have a hoop in my driveway.
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
Bye.
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
T.
Oh, I missed you so much.
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
This is ridiculous.
That's a real thing.
This sucks.
Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
Like librarians.
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
���Get out.���
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
Yeah... hey Stanley-
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
Yes, we did it!
Phones?
You can see her...
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
Later, man.
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
We're called Kevin and the Zits.
It's been out for ages, man.
She goes to another school.
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
I can't even imagine.
No.
It smells like throw up in here.
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
What, no candy?
What's different about you? You look worse.
No.
No. No he's not.
Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you.
God, I hate it.
It never gets old.
Kevin.
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
Finally! That old shredder sucked.
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
Hi.
Your arm feels good on my back.
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
No me fault.
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
We got our spaces back.
Oh, nice!
Hungrier.
Yes.
Yes.
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
Yeah.
Ooh, there���s Angela! I work with her!
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
Go ahead.
What
So... you're going to provide them, then?
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
Stick spicy food up her butt.
This is where we go
Five bucks says it's over 50.
Yes, well done!
No!
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
[at the same time as Dwight] Trees.
Oooh.
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?
Different stuff.
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
Tuna Tuna Tuna.
Hot!
I'd like a magazine.
Hot tamales.
Stay.
Jan?  What's new?
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
I'm going to enjoy this.
This is flatter.
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
We'll stay late.
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
Yeah!
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
I���ve never met anyone like that.
Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work.
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
You didn't run for me...
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
Sup?
Michael.
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
We do.
Try it in another sentence.
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
A lightbul--
That's beautiful. No, I totally get that.
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Niiice.
Chicken piccata, side salad.
It's a trap.
All right.
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
Oooo, now do the Swedish chef.
Yeah!
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
It's a Steve Miller Tribute Band.
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
Jo, there's books in my chair.
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
200
You got outdoors time?
[listening to music through headphones] Yeahhh.
Q.
No, but maybe the reason���
Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I���m gay.
Hi.
Oh, yes I can.
You could put a banana in it.
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
What do you think that was about?
Michael!
So long, noise!
No!
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
So did you hear?
I think you do, mon.
No he's not the boss.
Come on, Dwight.
Yes!
Nothing.
Nice!
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
[quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.
I can't work Saturday.
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
Michael you could put your initials in it.
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
Go ahead
Yes!
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
Do you want a M&M?
You wanna play with the cactus?
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan]
Two��� [picks Angela up again]
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
Yeah.
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
We need to assemble the five families.
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
Whoa.
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
Thank you.
Later.
Not food and stuff.
This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
Oh...cause you smell like bacon.
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
You keep think that.
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
Hey, Ryan. [taps board, makes farting noise]
[sarcastically] Oh, I bet you like it.
Oh, but you still said 'I'm sorry.'
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
Right. Now.
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
I'm guessing not.
I heard they made out and had sex.
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
Cool. Thank God they found her, too.
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
No, no, that makes total sense.
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
[laughing] Yeah, people hate you.
Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?
Jan.
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
Hey, screw you!
oooh
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
Oh, that would be impressive... if
No, thirty.
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
That'd be DUI.
Hi, Creed, what's up?
This.
[snickers]
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
I want the foot bath.
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Whoa!
Oh...
Well, I wish for a million wishes.
Something with animals. Or people.
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Thank you.
Later Jim.
I would love that.
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Whoa!
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.
Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
I'd still like one.
It was me.
You do that on TV!
I didn't see where it was.
I���m losing my balance.
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
[all get up to leave] OK.
Nice.
[to Angela] Shhh...
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
Yeah [nervously]���prank
Oh hey guys.
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
Michael, what does a bean mean?
Oscar, we're in the middle of talking.
It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!
When do we leave?
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
You look like you have the munchies.
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
You have a penis?
See you later, Jim.
Cause that's my name.
Okay, Penguin. [laughs]
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
That was awesome!
What���s happening in three months?
Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
Oh, man!
I was looking for patterns.
Sounds beautiful!
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
What does a bean mean?
Welcome home.
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
That's pretty young.
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
Yeah.
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
Me do it now.  Go.  Stop worry.
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
Big Boobs.
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
Nice... she is
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Right. My mom-
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
[to Angela] It's his first day back.
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
No.
Me too.
I know...
I am so sorry.
Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
Oh, will we get to see that look?
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
A wheel is supposed to spin.
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
Okay.
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
But I do like her just the way she is.
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
Back off me.
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
Just hurry. [hangs up]
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
Shoot.
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
Yeah.
Push harder, Dwight.
It was like two hundred dollars.
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
Yes, you are right. Forgive me.
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Why would you ask me?
Shh.
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
That���s a flush.
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.
That sucks so much.
Michael's movie?  Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh.
Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises]
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
The thing you just said?
Croak!
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
Nope. I did not see you either.
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
Phyllis?
What're you doing? You never have plans.
With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.
Or you're dead.
Right.
Yeah.
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
Was it worth it?
Thanks for the party, Michael.
However it's normally done.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
Cookies, eh?
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
No way.
[clears his throat]
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
You mean where my desk is?
Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.
Please...
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
I would so rather be in prison.
Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
I never seen herpes on you.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
[surprised] Wait, what?
Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.
Awesome.
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
[off screen] Hurts like hell.
Are you going to beat me up?
...What?
Hi!
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
For sure.
[murmurs from group in agreement]
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
Whoa.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
I suck.
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
Tuna. Check you later.
What does that mean?
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
Are you kidding me?
Back...
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
That looks good. Back. Whoa whoa whoa!
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
I'm not crying.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
Staples.
Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
So, like, a disco cafe?
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
The branch closed. Forever.
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
[giggling] Mean but good!
Someone has it.
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Well, now I think I might not.
I think we're out.
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
I do.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
Yes! [hugs Angela]
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
Okay, bye.
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
I have very little patience for stupidity.
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
We don't tell her.
Really?
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
Hello.
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
Hey.
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Ok guys, ���we all drink them all���.
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
Hmm.
Do we have one?
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
Still said it.
Michael's a genius.
Yeah. How was it?
That is not the question.
When he started the fire.
You too.
Morning.
I do gamble Michael.
But Phyllis, it's not his baby.
Or when we're bored.
[holds up 'Robitussin'] Riboflavin?
Riiight. The gym. [snickers]
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
Nice!
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
Ron Artest, Kelly.
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
Yeah.
Oh yes.
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
Yeah.
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
Hungrier.
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
I do know how to read though!
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
I'm sorry.
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
I don���t get it.
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
What?
All right.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
How much did you win?
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
Kevin Malone.
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
About what?
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
How's the candle game?
