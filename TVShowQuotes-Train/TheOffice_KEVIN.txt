Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
And he can get any girl that he wants.
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
Oh, will we get to see that look?
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
Then why don't you do something about it?
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
But that was my only pair of shoes.
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
I would want to live with no legs.
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
Michael you could put your initials in it.
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
I heard they made out and had sex.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
But you didn't want to start with us?
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
But I do like her just the way she is.
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
I do not want to talk about it.
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
