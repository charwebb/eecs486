I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
I do not want to talk about it.
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
Oh, will we get to see that look?
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
But you didn't want to start with us?
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
I would want to live with no legs.
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
And he can get any girl that he wants.
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
Michael you could put your initials in it.
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
But I do like her just the way she is.
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
An antacid that you only take once a week.
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
I heard they made out and had sex.
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
Then why don't you do something about it?
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
But that was my only pair of shoes.
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
