But save time. More success.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
I don���t get it.
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.
But...
What do you think that was about?
This sucks.
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
Hey Pam.
That seems early, even for her.
Cool.
All-in.
[whispers to Erin] I'm gonna kill you.
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
No. [chuckles]
Ooh.
How's your fart project coming?
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
However it's normally done.
No way!
Shoot.
About what?
Michael's movie?  Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh.
Mm-hmm.
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
What is he doing?
What?!? No!
Croak!
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
[in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God.
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
So... you're going to provide them, then?
You mean where my desk is?
She thought I was your boyfriend.
Hey, Kelly; I called him Fire Guy.
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
No. Yes!
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
Present company excluded?
Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
Whoa, I'll try it.
Man, that thing's bigger than I am.
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
Nope. I did not see you either.
Yeah.
Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work.
Yeah.
Y'all.
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
Pam. Can you vote for other people?
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
[to Andy] I'm calling the meeting anyway.
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
How much did you win?
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
Thank you, Michael.
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
Yeah.
Please...
Of course.
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
...when I thought I had skin cancer.
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
Stay.
Well, w���
Here...
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
I almost died.
Thank you.
It smelled
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon?
You've got to be kidding!
Reeeeally.
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
Come on Jim, you're killing her!
Yeah?
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
No. I won't say it.
Good pizza.
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
Was it worth it?
See world.
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
Michael, I hated the twirl.
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
When will the new copier be ready?
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
Chicken piccata, side salad.
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
I don't feel anything.
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
I would want to live with no legs.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
Damn it.
All right.
An Escalade.
He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.
Hot tub party?
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
Little old man boy.
It's a Steve Miller Tribute Band.
Yeah, thank you Phyllis.
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
Oh, will we get to see that look?
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
Dude, you gotta believe.
Booby honking.
Michael, please he--
We have to.
[tries stapler/marker combo] Okay.
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
Oooh.
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
This is ridiculous.
Can I join too?
The debate is whether she is hot.
Tuna Tuna Tuna.
No, constantly.  Like, for
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
We got our spaces back.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
Yes, you are right. Forgive me.
Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?
Cool.
How do you know?
Q.
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
You're in here.
Please, stop.
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Andy, you're up, let's go!
What the hell?
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
I insult you, Oscar.
...What?
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
I know...
You look like you have the munchies.
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Thank you.
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
Most of that is good.
Whhh... What are you guys doing?
Oh yeah.
Not really.
No but that's not fair.
Please, please. Please.
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
Erin, would you have lunch with me?
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
...ces. [chuckles]
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
How 'bout Cooper's then?
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
No way.
She goes to another school.
I do gamble Michael.
Yeah.
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
Oh no, that's, that's not happening.
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
Cool. Bye.
No way.
No-
Oh, I bet you ask?
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
Do you want a M&M?
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
Oscar.  Angela.
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
Someone has it.
You should go to Hedonism.
Good thing you didn't listen to me.
Where���s the, uh, basket for gifts?
Whoa.
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
Yes, we did it!
Bye, Phillip. High five.
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Oh, Yes!
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I���m gay.
I think he's singing.
Later.
Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
[gasps]
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
I heard they made out and had sex.
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves]
Yes.
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
Yes!
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
Push harder, Dwight.
Yes!
What���s happening in three months?
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
Ooh, can I be a pirate?
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
The Penguin.
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
Oh yeah!
A wheel is supposed to spin.
Try it in another sentence.
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
Then see you later building.
Michael could win.
Are you going to beat me up?
I can't decide what to get.
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
I would so rather be in prison.
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
Yeah.
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
Wha...
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
Nicely done!
Hey, Ryan.
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
I donated sperm.
I think Karen has a prettier face.
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Wh...
What does this mean? What does it mean!
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
Hey, screw you!
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Michael?
It smells like throw up in here.
Sounds beautiful!
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Seriously?  You're okay with that?
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
Hey, Ryan. [taps board, makes farting noise]
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
[smiles] I like it.
I'm from here!
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
We're not listening.
Do we have one?
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
Ok guys, ���we all drink them all���.
Nice.
That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
I was looking for patterns.
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
No, thirty.
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
How about Cugino's?
[Mouths 'hi' at the stripper]
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
Michael. [tapping on door]
Egons.
I always set it at 69. [snickers]
As has Kevin!
I said see you later building.
Any cat, you mean.
Right. Now.
Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
Italian.
Hi!
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
He's like a better-looking Andy.
I remember.
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
Yeah.
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
Hey guys it's my turn.
The branch closed. Forever.
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
Thank you.
Totally. George Clooney.
Not anymore.
What are you doing?
[music plays] Whoo!
That is so good, Michael
You were super mean.
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Interesting.
I���m losing my balance.
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
Yes, well done!
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Whoa!
Let���s get this over with, Pam.
Yeah.
Finally! That old shredder sucked.
Hi!
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
I... did not.
Okay, bye.
Yeah. That's pretty bad.
Later, man.
Yeah. How was it?
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
[giggling] Mean but good!
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
[thinks] Eleven.
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
Yeah. [everyone raises hands again]
[shakes head no]
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
[heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming?
That was a really cool move.
Yeah.
Hi, Toby.
Guys.
Damn it!
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
That looks good. Back. Whoa whoa whoa!
Yes.
No, I-
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
Dammit.
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
[laughing] Yeah, people hate you.
No, under the jacket.
Cause, you're the boss!
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
For birthdays!
What does that mean?
Uh oh. She's doing it again.
Yeah, that���you're being really mean, Andy.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
Phones?
Yeah.
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
I bet you were.
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
We're called Kevin and the Zits.
Nice.
Wait, what?
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
We're bored a lot.
Uh huh.
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Michael?
Wow. That is crazy.
Yes.
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
It's a trap.
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
That is a dangerous game, friendo.
Yeah, we can go eat pie.
Hello.
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
I knew it!
Well, thanks. I appreciate that.
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
Woah, woah [Delivery man with oversized bear]
No me fault.
How's the candle game?
Tip-top shape.
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
[listening to music through headphones] Yeahhh.
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
I wish my car had a bathroom.
Um, I might have skin cancer.
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
You keep think that.
We want our parking spaces back!
What does that mean?
It was me.
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
Phillip is so fat.
It's a good idea.
You did it.
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
Can I have your pencils?
It's out in the hall.
It feels unbelievable!
I'm in a band.
[holds up 'Robitussin'] Riboflavin?
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
Totally!
Can you hop?
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
You do that on TV!
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
I'm going to!
Hey, man.
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
Oh, did I win the pool?
Oh, man!
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
They were stolen?
I can do that.
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
That's really comfortable. [Michael gasps]
Here you go. [hands money]
I know! It���s alphabetical.
Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
Yeah. Oh.
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
C' is for suspension.
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
Warning! Warning! Warning!
She's prettier than you though.
Hey!
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
No, no, that makes total sense.
Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Oooo, now do the Swedish chef.
No. No he's not.
I do not want to talk about it.
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
They call me Kevin.
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
Oooo.
I want the foot bath.
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Michael, that was fun.
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
We call it Hate Ball.
Um... Business!
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
Nice outfit.
There are no wrong answers.
Hi.
Wait, you didn't give it back?
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
Angela.
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
[mouthful of food] I understand.
[nervously stuttering] I... have... things...
Don't look at me. [smiles at camera]
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
[rings bell] Les Jolies Choses.
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
My name is Kevin.
[nods] Hey...
Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.
You're welcome!
No. I'm still waiting.
No, but maybe the reason���
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
: That sounds great.
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
[watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut?
It was great to see you, Jan.
I can't work Saturday.
That is my name.
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
Boi-oi-oi-ing
Cookies, eh?
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?
Or when we're bored.
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
Yeah.
Michael, have you met the Penguin?
Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump.
Congrats Phil!
Something with animals. Or people.
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
Different stuff.
Right.
She looks like a monster.
I'm Kevin.
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
Or the me that stinks.
What?
Do you think we should go ?
Back...
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
Yeah.
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
Michael!
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
I am Oscar Martinez.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
Not food and stuff.
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
What're you doing? You never have plans.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand]
The mob.
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
I don���t think so.
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
But Phyllis, it's not his baby.
Yeah.
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
[Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti.
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
[running laps around the conference room] Yes!
Yeah.
I do the numbers.
What else you got?
Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
Already sent it to you my friend.
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
I think we're out.
Yeah. This place is great.
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Nice.
Oh, then pick TV.
Hey.
[nods]
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
On what?
Federal and State.
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
Taste test? I���m in!
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Cool.
I'm not taking Rogaine.
[grinning] Oh boy! What's happening?
That was awesome!
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
You too.
Well, I wish for a million wishes.
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
Pete what?
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Whoa.
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
Me too.
Oh I'm in.
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
Yeah [all murmuring]
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
That is not the question.
Huh?
Will do.
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
Yeah [nervously]���prank
It never gets old.
I think that's from Big.
What?
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Whoa.
Oh yes.
Back off me.
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
Oscar. Angela.
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
Me.
Yes!
Thank you.
You don't know that.
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
Phillip got this for me?
Account...? Michael, what is going on?
I do know how to read though!
Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
The tires look pretty worn.
But I do like her just the way she is.
No no no!
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
That's a real thing.
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
I'd still like one.
Wait, why am I a racist?
What, no candy?
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Yeah, me too.
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
Hi.
Because of how much Angela hates it.
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
Right.
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
Are those the lyrics?
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.
[giggles] Little Kevin.
Is everything ok, Michael?
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
Nice! Yeah.
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
I never seen herpes on you.
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
We all got to go sometime.
You didn't run for me...
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
Jan.
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
Oh zip it.
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
Ooh, ooh!
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
Hold it.
Jan?  What's new?
You are never going to find them.
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
Exactly.
Yes!
Many small time make big time.
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
[answers phone] Hello.
Wait, all of them?
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
Sup?
Ohh.
Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes!
Where are we going?
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
They have no idea what happened.
Me?
Didn't you two used to do it?
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
And that is Dallas. [shows money]
Well, why don't you shut up!
We don't tell her.
Just hurry. [hangs up]
Me and Pete are building a tower.
Oh, I'll take 'em.
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
You own a bar?
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
So long, noise!
Right.
Hooters?
Welcome home.
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
Hungrier.
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
And he can get any girl that he wants.
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
Whoa.
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
Well... well damn-it.
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
Come on, Dwight.
Yeah.
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
Yes.  I am an accountant.
[looks at Andy and giggles]
Ohhh...
No.
You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
Okay, I got this one.
Oh...cause you smell like bacon.
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
Andy.
Hi.
Good Valentine's.
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
No, not yet.
Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
Oh...
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
All of us?
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
Nice!
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
It was like two hundred dollars.
Morning.
The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.
No.
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Whoo-hoo!
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
That's not fair.
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
Jo, there's books in my chair.
Wayne Johnson? The Rock?
Do you have any savings?
Yes. Me do.
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
Guys.
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
Hmm...
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
Even I know that's weird.
What's going on?
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
Are you serious? From Star Trek?
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
Guys come on. I'm right here.
Yeah, it won't shred magazines.
That'd be DUI.
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
No, it's not.
Whoa.
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
What -
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
Right. My mom-
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
Awesome!
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
That sucks so much.
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
Andy, are there documentary groupies?
Damn it.
[at the same time as Dwight] Trees.
No.
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
When do we leave?
Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah, Michael, I just uh...
Nooo!
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
[to Angela] It's his first day back.
So what do we do now?
Hey! I can make that error.
Sweep the leg.
Go ahead
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
Because of reasons...
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
Who would want it?
You had me at 'Sex.'
Yeah.
I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
[all get up to leave] OK.
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Later, Jim.
Oh hey guys.
Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
Are you kidding me?
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
[with mouth full] Yes.
Hey!
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
Shh.
[bleep] you, Gabe!
Damn it! [banging machine]
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
Oh, geeze.
I didn't see where it was.
Ooh, there���s Angela! I work with her!
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
I missed you!
Pam is taller.
Hot!
This is where we go
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
Jim, put it on.
Awesome.
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
What do you mean?
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
45
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
Are you on email?
I���ve never met anyone like that.
I can't relax about it, you know?
One order.
James Bond was a spy.
That's pretty young.
You love your mom.
[waves] Hi.
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
None taken.
Michael, what does a bean mean?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
Another one?
[in accent] 'ello, mate!
Your name looks really nice.
Well, now I think I might not.
Is that all it was?
Romances?
Jim has got it bad for Pam.
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
Does and email count?
Yes.
Niiice.
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
Yeah.
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
It was kind of hard to hear.
Yea.
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
Nnnnice. Wow!
Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
Better...
Yeah.
I do. [applause] Come on everyone...
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
Meredith, I tell you all the time.
200
Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
Yeah. Respect the lei.
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
She wasn't that hot.
���Get out.���
Cool. Thank God they found her, too.
Yes, thank you.
[snickers]
Dude, you should know.
You would.
Okay.
Three hundred pounds!
Oscar, talk to him.
[interupting] Hey Ryan, you coming?
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
[clears his throat]
We'll stay late.
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
We do.
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Dunh-duh-na-dah!
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
I think this thing is broken.
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
I���ll take him.
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
Kevin Malone.
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Got that, bimbo?
Riiight. The gym. [snickers]
Or carnivals!
Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
Yes! [giggles and picks up Angela]
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
Well, Hol, this is it.
Three���
Hidden from [whisper] them.
I don���t know.
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
Yep, yep, yep.
Shh, here she comes!
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
I'm going to call him Little Kevin.
Michael is that a wig?
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
Guys.
[off screen] Hurts like hell.
Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
Are you seeing anyone right now?
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
Later Jim.
Pam's back on the market again.
Of course.
Oh!
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
Oh man, this is weird!
That���s not���
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
I can't even imagine.
One order.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
Ron Artest, Kelly.
Oooh yeah... [people chuckle] Jim and Pam!
No.
Whoa!
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
Hi.
He got scented candles!
Five bucks says it's over 50.
Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
See you later, Jim.
Mine.
So, like, a disco cafe?
Thank God.
Nice.
Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
Hey, Jo!
No, it is here.
What are you guys talking about?
Yes!
Hey, you going tonight?
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
What does a bean mean?!
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
Do you like Steve Miller?
When can I sit on your lap?
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Yes!  That's what I'm talking about.
No, wait. [put on a hat] Yeah.
Oh, my God!
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
Nice.
Oh, I missed you so much.
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Yep.
Oh, nice!
Woah. [Delivery man with flowers]
Yeah. Every single day.
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
Nice! We got burned!
Nice!
Oh, yes I can.
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Thanks, so sweet.
This is getting weird.
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
He is black... right? And...
When he started the fire.
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
No.
I have very little patience for stupidity.
Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes]
Hey!
Well, I am. [hugs Michael]
And John Wayne?
I have a tambourine.
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
Fine. [throws plane, doesn't fly]
Six-six-five-zero.
It's a bitter situation.
Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
[to Oscar] What was that stuff?
Don't push it.
What does that mean?
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
But you didn't want to start with us?
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
I could sing it.
I would love that.
Hey, we're gonna do this...
Make it go taller.
I'm guessing not.
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
That���s totally uncool.
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?
Nice.
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
Yes!
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
Wow.
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
Red gloves.
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
Then why are there two flyers?
Michael, you're at least forty six!
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
Thank.
Whoa.
Maybe I'm the father.
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Oh, I don���t know.
Pam?
Wow.
What's different about you? You look worse.
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
I insult you! To your face!
Yeah!
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
Cause that's my name.
[offscreen] No, it does not!
Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
Ok.
Whoa.
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
No.
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
Okay.
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
[to Angela] Shhh...
Night, Pam.
I can't wait.
Listen, it���s important. You���ve gotta hear this.
Like librarians.
Oh, that would be impressive... if
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
You have a penis?
[spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
Butt honking.
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
Hot tamales.
Nice.
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Who's pickle?
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.
Really, really fun.
Dude, you will not be sorry.
Uh oh.
Yes!
That is lame.
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
[empties bowl of M&M's into his mouth]
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Michael is that scotch?
I'll go to the diner with you.
Nice... she is
Or you're dead.
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
That's awesome!
[puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that?
Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?
Wag.
Stay away from my mom.
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
I'm going to help you.
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
Why don't you go Michael?
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
Okay, Michael.
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
Our question is���it seems dumb.
Didn't drop a single ball!
Please, stop.
That���s the winter season., three months.
[mouths] Damn...
Michael, the baby's already been born.
Thank you.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
Good thinking.
Hey.
Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble.
Will you take a check?
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
Are there carbs in vodka?
Wait til' Monday.
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
[to Angela] Shhhh...
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
[playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]
[walks in] Hi!
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Go ahead.
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
Then I won't let you down.
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
Excellent.
This is flatter.
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
[applauds]
Michael, isn't that Holly?
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
Yeah, later dude.
Stick spicy food up her butt.
Sometimes.
I miss Stacy.
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
Yeah.
You cannot make me run.
Oscar, we're in the middle of talking.
I accept your decision!
Because... You would love it.
We're here for the show, Michael.
No!
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
Yeah, women be shoppin'.
Yes.
You never call back.
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
I suck.
All right.
You wanna play with the cactus?
Michael, you might lose your condo.
Wait, are they searching all our computers?
Good cookie.
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
Wait a minute. Yes I am.
Next to the IHOP?
Oh yeah!
My money's on Pam.
Michael you could put your initials in it.
What?
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
Yes!
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
Still said it.
I think I should call her.
No he's not the boss.
Set!
What happened?
I guess I could be nicer.
I don't know.
Hello? Hey.
Yeah.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
Thank you, Holly.
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
[sniffles] It���s just that I���m so emotional.
Thanks for the party, Michael.
Why not your condo?
Yeah, I think she's full of it.
So, there was talk of oatmeal.
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
I'm petrified.
Nice.
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
[crying] At least I got chocolate.
Call it.
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
The fire pit is a no-brainer.
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
Oh, I bet Jim goes too.
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
I have a hoop in my driveway.
You wanna go to the beach?
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
Two��� [picks Angela up again]
Hi.
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
All right.
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
Uh, the man tree puts its penis-
I'm almost done.
Tuna. Check you later.
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
The beef is poisoned?
Night, Oscar.
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
Yes.
Their bread's really good.
Hmm.
Hi Pam, is Jim there?
What is your type?
Whose it from? [to Oscar]
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
Packer, we accept. [others disagree]
She touched my shoulder.
Thank you.
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
Don't eat it.
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
Nice.
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
Angela, it is a million degrees.
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
An antacid that you only take once a week.
It���s a answer.
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
No.
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
You can see her...
He's not my client.
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
[raises hand] Do we have to?
So���DARRYL! A GIRL!
oooh
I'm sorry.
What
Ni-
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
314 pies.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
Don���t tell me what to do!
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I definitely do.
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
Yeah!
I���m���good.
Why would you ask me?
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
Ditto.
No.
MILF!
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
Because you're gay.
What a chubbers. Whoa.
Hi.
What's goin' on?
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
Hmm. Martin?
See world.  Oceans. Fish.  Jump. China.
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
I wanted a cookie.
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
Long johns?  A shaw?
It... yeah.
[surprised] Wait, what?
That was so awesome.
Stacy.
Pete...
You said she liked me.
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
[giggling]
Nice. Nice.
Me do it now.  Go.  Stop worry.
Thank you.
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
I can't believe we're missing that!
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
Yeah, me too.
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
Better luck next time, pal.
Come here [hugs Dwight]
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
It feels amazing!
You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank...
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
But that was my only pair of shoes.
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
Bearded man boy.
Michael, did you tell your mom yet?
This.
Exactly.
No.
[Email chiming] [snickers] Did you see that?
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
[quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
Kevin Malone.
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
[muffled] I'm still enjoying  it.
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
Yes.
T.
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!
Are you going to try it?
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
Jim said that?
Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
For sure.
[murmurs from group in agreement]
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
What does a bean mean?
[still giggling] Tea.
[looking at Oscar] Mama Bear!
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
[to Michael] Is there a cookie?
[giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
[at the same time as Dwight] Forest.
You wanna get high?
I just thought-
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
Wait, C-R-A-Z...
Cool. Okay. [Pam hangs up] Bye.
Hi.
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
Big Boobs.
Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan]
Hi.
Wow, that's awesome!
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
It smells like cookies.
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
A lightbul--
Hi Jan, you look... tan.
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
T minus...
We need a warning signal.
Okay. [leaves]
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
As would I.
Yeah... hey Stanley-
Yeah.
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!
I think it should be a surprise.
Phyllis?
Bye.
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
Oh, right. The state senator.
I feel scared a little.
I think you do, mon.
We did it.
Go.
Nice! [rest of the office looks excited]
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
Who's we, you and Jim?
