Yes!
Big Boobs.
What?
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
It feels unbelievable!
Nice! Yeah.
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
Oooh yeah... [people chuckle] Jim and Pam!
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
No. [chuckles]
Wow. That is crazy.
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
This is flatter.
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
I'm petrified.
Bearded man boy.
Fire girl. [looks around] Too soon?
You aren't curious?
Egons.
Yeah. That's pretty bad.
This.
Who would want it?
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
We have to.
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
[rings bell] Les Jolies Choses.
Woah, woah [Delivery man with oversized bear]
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
Someone has it.
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
Dammit.
I would want to live with no legs.
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
Guys.
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
Oh no, that's, that's not happening.
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Andy, you're up, let's go!
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Because of sex?
Night, Pam.
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Yeah.
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
Ok guys, ���we all drink them all���.
So, there was talk of oatmeal.
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
She touched my shoulder.
[to Oscar] What was that stuff?
Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
Can you hop?
What does a bean mean?
Nnnnice. Wow!
That���s totally uncool.
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
What are you doing?
Whoa.
No.
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
It's been out for ages, man.
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
Pam, look out!
Guys come on. I'm right here.
Hot tamales.
Well, what if you're cold?
Yes!
Hooters?
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
Oooo.
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
What?!? No!
I'm not taking Rogaine.
The branch closed. Forever.
Oh, nice!
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
We don't tell her.
Damn it.
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
You should go to Hedonism.
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
[raises hand] Do we have to?
Wha...
Yes! [giggles and picks up Angela]
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
That is my name.
I would love that.
Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis.
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
Red gloves.
You do that on TV!
Cool. Okay. [Pam hangs up] Bye.
Hi.
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
That seems early, even for her.
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
Ni-
Because you're gay.
Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
It... yeah.
Yes! Wait, why?
Okay, bye.
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
Um, I might have skin cancer.
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
Thank you.
Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves]
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
Our question is���it seems dumb.
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
There are no wrong answers.
Oscar, talk to him.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
[nods] Hey...
Nice! [rest of the office looks excited]
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
You too.
Uh, the man tree puts its penis-
That is not the question.
I always set it at 69. [snickers]
Yeah!
Yes! [hugs Angela]
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
I can't wait.
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
That's not fair.
[bleep] you, Gabe!
Erin, would you have lunch with me?
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
Sounds beautiful!
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
It smells like throw up in here.
Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you.
No-
I would so rather be in prison.
He got scented candles!
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
Whoa!
Right. My mom-
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
Boi-oi-oi-ing
Pete...
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
That���s not���
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
Well, why don't you shut up!
What the hell?
Push harder, Dwight.
We all got to go sometime.
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
Hmm.
All right.
[mouthful of food] I understand.
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
I know! It���s alphabetical.
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
Sweep the leg.
Finally! That old shredder sucked.
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
I can't decide what to get.
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
Yeah, that���you're being really mean, Andy.
Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
[to Michael] Is there a cookie?
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
A lightbul--
You cannot make me run.
What is it?
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
I know...
How's the candle game?
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
Hey.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
[offscreen] No, it does not!
[blows a sigh of relief]
Taste test? I���m in!
You didn't run for me...
Hey.
Nice! We got burned!
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
What is he doing?
It's a trap.
Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I���m gay.
So what do we do now?
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
Account...? Michael, what is going on?
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
[holds up 'Robitussin'] Riboflavin?
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
Totally!
Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
James Bond was a spy.
She goes to another school.
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
Nicely done!
No, it is here.
Cool. Superhero.
Yeah.
I wonder what he did.
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
I think we're out.
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?
Hi Jan, you look... tan.
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
On what?
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
Cool.
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
Still said it.
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
I'm from here!
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
Michael, you might lose your condo.
[still giggling] Tea.
Wait, are they searching all our computers?
Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
Phyllis?
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
Welcome home.
They have no idea what happened.
Go ahead
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
I'd like a magazine.
Or you're dead.
I didn't see where it was.
MILF!
Nice outfit.
I guess I could be nicer.
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
[playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
Nothing.
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
No, but maybe the reason���
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
Two��� [picks Angela up again]
Who's pickle?
I can't relax about it, you know?
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
We'll stay late.
Thank you.
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
Michael, have you met the Penguin?
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
No way.
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
As would I.
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
Yes!
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Thank God.
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
Yes, thank you.
Yep.
Yeah. This place is great.
Wow.
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
[sarcastically] Oh, I bet you like it.
Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
Nice.
We're not listening.
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
Sup?
Better...
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
And he can get any girl that he wants.
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
Oh, then pick TV.
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
Nooo!
I am Oscar Martinez.
He is black... right? And...
Or when we're bored.
You got outdoors time?
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Awesome!
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
Hello.
[looking at Oscar] Mama Bear!
Whoa.
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
: That sounds great.
Okay.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
Bye.
The fire pit is a no-brainer.
Can I get some candy, or something?
What -
Where���s the, uh, basket for gifts?
I suck.
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
Yeah. Every single day.
[thinks] Eleven.
I think he's singing.
That's beautiful. No, I totally get that.
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
One order.
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Oh, my God!
Angela, it is a million degrees.
What does a bean mean?!
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
You mean where my desk is?
Is that all it was?
Later, man.
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
See you later, Jim.
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Wow!
You own a bar?
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
No.
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Don't push it.
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
Hi.
Does and email count?
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
Well... well damn-it.
No. I won't say it.
It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!
Michael, did you tell your mom yet?
[grinning] Oh boy! What's happening?
Are you on email?
Right.
She looks like a monster.
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
Later.
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
It feels amazing!
What else you got?
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
Yes.
Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
Whoa.
Are you going to try it?
Wag.
No way.
314 pies.
Tip-top shape.
Michael?
Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
That's hilarious.
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
Okay.
Fine, fine.  I���ll talk normally.
Do we have one?
Dude, you will not be sorry.
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
Next to the IHOP?
Yeah.
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
You're in here.
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
Warning! Warning! Warning!
Wow, that's awesome!
You're welcome!
Of course.
Cookies, eh?
Can I join too?
Hey.
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
I don't feel anything.
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
Better luck next time, pal.
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
I���ll take him.
Oh yeah.
Do you like Steve Miller?
Michael you could put your initials in it.
No he's not the boss.
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
For birthdays!
Hmm. Martin?
No.
[giggles] Little Kevin.
Damn it!
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
[giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Something with animals. Or people.
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
Congrats Phil!
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble.
Michael, I hated the twirl.
[interupting] Hey Ryan, you coming?
A wheel is supposed to spin.
[Email chiming] [snickers] Did you see that?
Yeah!
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
I think it should be a surprise.
Nice.
What's going on?
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
You weren't here for that.
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
Thank.
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
Call it.
That is lame.
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
Nice. Nice.
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
[everyone applauding] Awesome!
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?
Your arm feels good on my back.
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
I have very little patience for stupidity.
No, I-
The debate is whether she is hot.
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
Listen, it���s important. You���ve gotta hear this.
Whoo-hoo!
Whhh... What are you guys doing?
Cool.
Good cookie.
I'm guessing not.
Stay.
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Not food and stuff.
Yes, well done!
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
Me too.
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
Uh oh. She's doing it again.
[music plays] Whoo!
Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
Yeah, me too.
...when I thought I had skin cancer.
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Ok.
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
No, it's not.
[nervously stuttering] I... have... things...
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
Nope. I did not see you either.
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
Then I won't let you down.
I'm sorry.
Well, I wish for a million wishes.
Different stuff.
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes]
Are you serious? From Star Trek?
Right.
He's like a better-looking Andy.
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
Michael is that a wig?
We got our spaces back.
Oooh.
I insult you! To your face!
Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan]
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
She thought I was your boyfriend.
I'd still like one.
Yeah.
Hey!
Romances?
No, thirty.
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
One order.
Damn it.
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
Oscar. Angela.
Yeah.
Oh, geeze.
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
Wait, what?
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
Oh, I definitely do.
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Yeah, women be shoppin'.
But I do like her just the way she is.
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
[watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut?
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
I do not want to talk about it.
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
I don���t get it.
Oh I'm in.
Yeah, thank you Phyllis.
I've dumped better than Erin.
Ditto.
I was looking for patterns.
God, I hate it.
Hi, Toby.
Six-six-five-zero.
Yea.
Thanks for the party, Michael.
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
Whoa.
Good thinking.
The beef is poisoned?
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
However it's normally done.
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
Later, Jim.
Well, thanks. I appreciate that.
It was great to see you, Jan.
Yes!
[heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming?
Woah. [Delivery man with flowers]
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
Wha-- wh--
See world.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
Good Valentine's.
I do. [applause] Come on everyone...
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
We call it Hate Ball.
What does that mean?
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
[listening to music through headphones] Yeahhh.
Italian.
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
Exactly.
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
That's pretty young.
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.
Please, please. Please.
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
Michael!
Yeah [nervously]���prank
Let���s get this over with, Pam.
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
Wayne Johnson? The Rock?
Yep, yep, yep.
Night, Oscar.
[waves] Hi.
Pam. Can you vote for other people?
Got that, bimbo?
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
Oh, will we get to see that look?
[puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that?
Three queens.
Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
Many small time make big time.
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
What's goin' on?
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
[at the same time as Dwight] Trees.
It smelled
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
It was kind of hard to hear.
Mm-hmm.
Ooh, ooh!
We're bored a lot.
Michael is that scotch?
You said she liked me.
No, no.
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
I remember.
When do we leave?
[applauds]
Please, stop.
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
What is your type?
Oh...cause you smell like bacon.
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.
Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?
Oh, I bet you ask?
We're called Kevin and the Zits.
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
[tries stapler/marker combo] Okay.
I do the numbers.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
Whose it from? [to Oscar]
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
Long johns?  A shaw?
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
Please...
Oh, Yes!
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
Jim, put it on.
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
It never gets old.
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
I'm on it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
Stay away from my mom.
That could be a good sign.
Hey!
I can't believe we're missing that!
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
[gasps]
Do you have any savings?
I���m losing my balance.
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
Didn't you two used to do it?
Angela, this is inappropriate.
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
Kevin.
You could put a banana in it.
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
Okay, Penguin. [laughs]
C' is for suspension.
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
Come on, the Three Amigos.
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
Whoa.
Hey, Ryan. [taps board, makes farting noise]
Tuna Tuna Tuna.
You can see her...
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
Tuna. Check you later.
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
[Mouths 'hi' at the stripper]
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
Do you want a M&M?
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
Really, really fun.
Yes.
Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
Nice.
Nice.
This sucks.
Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?
So... you're going to provide them, then?
[walks in] Hi!
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
Didn't drop a single ball!
Here you go. [hands money]
You had me at 'Sex.'
How about Cugino's?
[to Angela] Shhh...
I could sing it.
Five bucks says it's over 50.
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
I think I should call her.
Are you going to beat me up?
Oh, right. The state senator.
That sucks so much.
But you didn't want to start with us?
Three���
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
Shh.
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
Hi Pam, is Jim there?
Yes!
Oooo, now do the Swedish chef.
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
An antacid that you only take once a week.
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Andy, are there documentary groupies?
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
I wanted a cookie.
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
What?
Shoot.
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
Yes!
All-in.
Bye, Phillip. High five.
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
Yes, you are right. Forgive me.
She wasn't that hot.
I think this thing is broken.
Oh, yes I can.
Yeah, Michael, I just uh...
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
Bye.
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
When he started the fire.
Right. Now.
Yes!  That's what I'm talking about.
[whispers to Erin] I'm gonna kill you.
I have a hoop in my driveway.
I insult you, Oscar.
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
Hmm...
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
Yeah.
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.
It���s a answer.
Morning.
Yeah, it won't shred magazines.
Wait, all of them?
Hi.
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
I never seen herpes on you.
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
No.
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
It was like two hundred dollars.
Packer, we accept. [others disagree]
Michael's movie?  Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh.
What do you think that was about?
Hungrier.
I heard they made out and had sex.
Are there carbs in vodka?
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
She's prettier than you though.
So long, noise!
Niiice.
Staples.
Nice.
Of course.
200
Oscar, we're in the middle of talking.
How much did you win?
Is everything ok, Michael?
You keep think that.
Thank you.
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
I'm Kevin.
You never call back.
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Try it in another sentence.
Phones?
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
And John Wayne?
Little old man boy.
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
I bet you were.
Yes!
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
Not anymore.
Wait, you didn't give it back?
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
Don't look at me. [smiles at camera]
I can't even imagine.
Who makes it?
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
[to Angela] Shhhh...
Another one?
Yes!
Are you seeing anyone right now?
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
Hi!
Oh man, this is weird!
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
Hungrier.
Good thing you didn't listen to me.
[mouths] Damn...
Ohh.
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
No. No he's not.
Make it go taller.
You wanna get high?
45
I'm not crying.
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
Okay, Michael.
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
[sniffles] It���s just that I���m so emotional.
Nice!
No no no!
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
Yeah. How was it?
Yeah!
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
Federal and State.
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
Ooh, can I be a pirate?
Yeah.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
Pam is taller.
Still scary.
Yes.
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
Yes. Me do.
Phillip is so fat.
You've got to be kidding!
Michael, that was fun.
Because of reasons...
I wish my car had a bathroom.
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
Whoa.
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
Yeah.
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
Are you kidding me?
What?
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
It's a Steve Miller Tribute Band.
It smells like cookies.
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
Yes.
Will you take a check?
I do know how to read though!
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
[holding mobile phone up] Go.
What's different about you? You look worse.
Michael, what does a bean mean?
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
Me.
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
Come on, Dwight.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
Hey, Kelly; I called him Fire Guy.
Pam?
[off screen] Hurts like hell.
Yeah.
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
You were super mean.
Oh yeah!
What does a bean mean?
I'm sorry.
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
Cause that's my name.
It's out in the hall.
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
I... did not.
Hello? Hey.
The thing you just said?
Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work.
Huh?
No.
Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.
I almost died.
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
Michael. [tapping on door]
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
[empties bowl of M&M's into his mouth]
Michael, you're at least forty six!
But that was my only pair of shoes.
But Phyllis, it's not his baby.
Back...
No.
Angela.
Who's we, you and Jim?
I���ve never met anyone like that.
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
[muffled] I'm still enjoying  it.
No, under the jacket.
I think it's over, man.
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank...
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
Like librarians.
I can't work Saturday.
That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
I miss Stacy.
Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
Yeah.
Oh, I bet Jim goes too.
...unbelievable.
I'm going to enjoy this.
You wanna go to the beach?
No, constantly.  Like, for
Don't eat it.
All right.
You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
[quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.
[laughing] Yeah, people hate you.
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
Present company excluded?
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
Interesting.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
Thank you.
You love your mom.
Riiight. The gym. [snickers]
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
All right.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Nice.
Well, now I think I might not.
[Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti.
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
What do you mean?
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Yeah.
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
Phillip got this for me?
Wait til' Monday.
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
Because of how much Angela hates it.
That was awesome!
That looks good. Back. Whoa whoa whoa!
Ooh.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Yes!
Uh huh.
Oh yes.
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
Not really.
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
Your name looks really nice.
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
Ooh, there���s Angela! I work with her!
I think you do, mon.
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
Fine. [throws plane, doesn't fly]
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
No.
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
And that is Dallas. [shows money]
You're wearing a woman's suit?
Yeah [kisses Darryl on the cheek]
What a chubbers. Whoa.
I'm going to help you.
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
Dude, you should know.
No.
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
Four!
Thank you, Holly.
Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand]
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
None taken.
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
You would.
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
Hi.
Wh...
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
No, not yet.
Hold it.
Me and Pete are building a tower.
That is a dangerous game, friendo.
T minus...
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
Why not your condo?
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
Just hurry. [hangs up]
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
Yeah, we can go eat pie.
You look like you have the munchies.
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
I knew it!
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
What are you guys talking about?
Oh yeah!
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
Hey Pam.
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
Oh hey guys.
[with mouth full] Yes.
I'm in a band.
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
Reeeeally.
Uh oh.
Michael could win.
Oh.
Well, I heard they made out
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
So, like, a disco cafe?
Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this.
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
That'd be DUI.
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
Three hundred pounds!
Wait, C-R-A-Z...
You have a penis?
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
What, no candy?
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
Yeah.
This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
That is so good, Michael
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Excellent.
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
Cool.
No, no, that makes total sense.
We want our parking spaces back!
Whoa, I'll try it.
Hi, Creed, what's up?
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
Me do it now.  Go.  Stop worry.
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
That���s a flush.
Nice.
Yeah. [everyone raises hands again]
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump.
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
...What?
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
This is ridiculous.
I am so sorry.
Nice.
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
Meredith, I tell you all the time.
No, wait. [put on a hat] Yeah.
Hey, man.
Come here [hugs Dwight]
I don't know.
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
But...
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
Yeah.
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
Next stop pies!
Yes!
No but that's not fair.
[in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God.
So did you hear?
[spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?
Right.
I have a tambourine.
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
Damn it! [banging machine]
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
I don���t think so.
Big mistake.
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
Yeah, later dude.
Yeah!
Hot!
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
When can I sit on your lap?
You wanna play with the cactus?
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
Was it worth it?
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
I accept your decision!
Jo, there's books in my chair.
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
Jim said that?
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
Me?
Go.
Already sent it to you my friend.
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
Yeah.
That was a really cool move.
That���s the winter season., three months.
The Penguin.
Open QuickTime.
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
Booby honking.
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
Yeah.
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
I donated sperm.
Hi.
Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
Yeah. Respect the lei.
Set!
My name is Kevin.
Hi.
Hey!
Oh zip it.
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
Oh, that would be impressive... if
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
Cool. Bye.
Any cat, you mean.
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
Come on Jim, you're killing her!
Wait, why am I a racist?
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
It's a good idea.
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Pam.
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
Hi.
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
Michael, please he--
Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
[all get up to leave] OK.
So���DARRYL! A GIRL!
[nods]
Yeah! Tell us a story.
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
You did it.
I feel scared a little.
Whoa!
For sure.
[murmurs from group in agreement]
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
Michael's a genius.
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
[to Angela] It's his first day back.
Shh, here she comes!
Why would you ask me?
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
I think Karen has a prettier face.
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
Hidden from [whisper] them.
Hey, screw you!
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Right.
Hot tub party?
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
As has Kevin!
[to Andy] I'm calling the meeting anyway.
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
Later Jim.
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Dude, you gotta believe.
But save time. More success.
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
How's your fart project coming?
Hey, you going tonight?
Michael.
Thank you.
What're you doing? You never have plans.
Michael, isn't that Holly?
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
Oh, man!
I said see you later building.
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
Yeah, I think she's full of it.
Oh!
[snickers]
How do you know?
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
They call me Kevin.
You know.
Thanks, so sweet.
Exactly.
Mine.
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
We need a warning signal.
Yeah?
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
Cool. Thank God they found her, too.
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
I���m���good.
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
Will do.
I don���t know.
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
Or the me that stinks.
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
Chicken piccata, side salad.
Their bread's really good.
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
Yes!
[surprised] Wait, what?
Oh, I'll take 'em.
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
Michael?
Oh, I don���t know.
Yes.  I am an accountant.
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
Yes, we did it!
Yeah.
Seriously?  You're okay with that?
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
Dunh-duh-na-dah!
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
Yeah.
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?
No!
See world.  Oceans. Fish.  Jump. China.
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
This is where we go
[giggling]
[running laps around the conference room] Yes!
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
Isn't it supposed to be, 'Drive safely'?
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Thank you.
Good pizza.
You are never going to find them.
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
I do.
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
Guys.
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
My money's on Pam.
Wow.
No. Yes!
Yeah [all murmuring]
No.
What does that mean?
Ron Artest, Kelly.
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
[at the same time as Dwight] Forest.
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
I want the foot bath.
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
Guys.
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
Sometimes.
Nice.
No.
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
The tires look pretty worn.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
...ces. [chuckles]
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.
Jim has got it bad for Pam.
Michael, the baby's already been born.
Andy.
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
Yeah.
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
That's really comfortable. [Michael gasps]
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
The mob.
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
I think that's from Big.
Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
What does that mean?
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
Wait a minute. Yes I am.
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
That's awesome!
Okay. [leaves]
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
Q.
All of us?
Oh, did I win the pool?
[giggling] Mean but good!
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
I'm almost done.
���Get out.���
Maybe I'm the father.
Stacy.
[looks at Andy and giggles]
Awesome.
Yes.
I missed you!
Nice!
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
What do you mean?
Hey, Ryan.
An Escalade.
Way to go, man.
Ohhh...
Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
Um... Business!
[in accent] 'ello, mate!
Then why are there two flyers?
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
[clears his throat]
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
Nice... she is
I just thought-
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
Oh, the other one's watching.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
Hey, Jo!
Then see you later building.
Hi.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
It's a bitter situation.
Yeah. Oh.
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
Because... You would love it.
Most of that is good.
No. I'm still waiting.
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
Croak!
No!
