Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
I do not want to talk about it.
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
But you didn't want to start with us?
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
But I do like her just the way she is.
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
But that was my only pair of shoes.
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
[giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can't keep doing this forever.
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
Michael you could put your initials in it.
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
What does this mean? What does it mean!
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
[Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car]
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
Could you just say, 'these are due back Thursday'?
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
An antacid that you only take once a week.
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
Oh, will we get to see that look?
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
Then why don't you do something about it?
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
I would want to live with no legs.
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
And he can get any girl that he wants.
I heard they made out and had sex.
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
