You knocked the mirror off of my car.
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
What an awesome party.  The best wedding I've ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho.'
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? [giggles] Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
An antacid that you only take once a week.
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
[sitting at Phyllis' desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
[Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Oh, will we get to see that look?
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
Michael you could put your initials in it.
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
Then why don't you do something about it?
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying]
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
No, okay, well, let me send you a demo, and... Better yet, I'll give Kelly the demo, and she can give it to you. It'll save us both on postage.
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
Hey, man. Good. Listen, my M&M's are under the desk if you want any.
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
[to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
[knocking on door] Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Angela���s cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can���t eat cats. You can���t eat cats, Kevin.
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]
Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
Obviously. He���s a sweet kid, Darryl. But he���s not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
What does this mean? What does it mean!
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
But that was my only pair of shoes.
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
[Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to 'not hot' team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
[singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ���Monster Mash.��� I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
I would want to live with no legs.
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, 'Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--'
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
Does that mean there's no toilet paper in the bathroom?
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
And he can get any girl that he wants.
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
But you didn't want to start with us?
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
It���s not a kid on a bike. It���s a man in a car.
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
[smacks Ryan's hand]  Not so fast... Fire Guy.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters]
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
[screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
[singing] So open eyes Lend us an ear We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year [Darryl whooping] Yeah.
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
[excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
[as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
Oh come on!  He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, 'Hired Guy.'
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
