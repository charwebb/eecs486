[in the kitchen and Stanley comes in and swipes Kevin's pretzel without Kevin seeing] Shoot.
No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch.
[giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
[to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.
I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
[watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
Oh, the Nets are super tough.  [Jim in pain from his lip]
No, you mean that you did a lot of messed up stuff to you... too?
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
[to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her?
Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia: a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
[after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
[singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
[again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
Oh, will we get to see that look?
It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
[to Michael]  Are you gonna eat with us?
Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say ���car no go���, and we best friends.  So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
What's that on your shirt? [points to Andy's shirt]
Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?  Or Pizza by Alfredo?
For some reason, my boss is obsessed with cookies. It's not my specialty. My specialty is pizza. But I'm flexible.
[in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.
[gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
[most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.
Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support. [claps, group joins]
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
Yeah, we���re aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
What was that word they said when they showed me ���Skrald mand���? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
[looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!
[out of breath] Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?
I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
[after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun] Loser. Losers. [Dwight holding up ���L��� to his forehead]
[imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
[dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
Michael you could put your initials in it.
[through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!
What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
Oh, I remember that.  That was SO funny.
I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
[after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
Well I���m just quoting you.  I would never say that about her.  I don���t know the woman.
Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
I should be turned on. But, last year, remember, I had that skin cancer scare, and so now all I can think is that I hope she was wearing sunscreen. God, I would love to rub some on her.
No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. [laughs] Oscar is having sex with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. [laughing still] Her life is a complete sham!
Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]
No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
[as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.]
What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
Oh you don't know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.
Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
[inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
[Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.
I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
But that was my only pair of shoes.
Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
Oooh!  [Kevin and Andy add suggestive 'bow-chicka-wow-wow' vocals]
Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
When I dropped out of school to watch more sports, a lot of people thought that I was nuts. Well who's laughing now?
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again]
Whether it���s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
Should we just keep opening up the presents?
[Chokes and spits it out] What is maw?!
There are so many people with motives, even me. Almost everyone is a suspect. Whoever did this is a genius. [laughs]
I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
How about, 'I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?'
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
Alright, let���s go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela]
because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
[spinning a new ���chore wheel��� while everyone claps] Okay, that���s what I���m talking about! Big money, big money! [wheel stops on ���mug duty���, disappointed] Mug duty?
But are, are you gonna pay for my mirror?
So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
But, Michael, Buvon gets to go parasailing every day, and that's fun.
I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry]
I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
I'm gonna take so much money off that guy.  That guy is a whale.  I'm gonna clean him out.  This is really gonna get me out of a hole.
Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
[Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It's getting my tie back on.
You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
[whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Yeah, I say we just go for it!
Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
Not really, my fiance is out of town.
That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
[to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
[Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
[Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I���m not that good at puzzles.
It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
[in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
Yeah, I don���t think that you understand wheels.
Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your penis.
No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]
[whispers in Holly's ear, Holly reacts with horrified look]
I would want to live with no legs.
At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
[taking a look] I don't think that's vomit.
So, Pam, I wonder who's gonna get 'longest engagement' this year.
[shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes]  No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
[in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
[stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]
Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
[looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]
Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
[phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
[wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
[holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
I heard they made out and had sex.
Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
[on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
But you didn't want to start with us?
Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
You���re not getting this, Peter. ��Make it go wider... up!
Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
Me feel good.  Body strong.  Sleep big last night.
[getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! [Oscar pies Kevin] Yes!
Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
[reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!
Why don't you turn it up? [Ryan moves to turn up the grill]  Uh! Not so fast... Fire Guy.  Think we need some more heat, Fire Guy?  Hey, Fire Guy, maybe we should burn Jim's house down.
What if he dies in the fire?  And that's the last thing you ever said to him.
Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
Hey Jan, you went to a sperm bank?
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
But I do like her just the way she is.
Cause I'm in a Steve Miller Tribute... Tribute Band.
[on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]
Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
[he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily].
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
[running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom!
I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, ���Look, a balloon.���
Ok.  Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play.  So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
[outstretches arms for a hug, Holly reluctantly complies]
Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
[Michael is listening to 'Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter' and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
Kidnapping is the asportation of a person against the person's will, so Michael asported him. [giggles]  Have you ever been aspor...
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
I'm the DJ because I really know how to heat up a party.
The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith.
[still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]
Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
[pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here.  I can't hold my breath that long.
I still do not have your reimbursement check.
I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar]
Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery���
[viewing the chore wheel for the first time] Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Wait, when you say 'that guy', you mean you?
Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
Yeah, but you have to admit it would be wild.
[everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
You guys are throwing a lot at me.
Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
OK...  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
I gotta erase a lotta stuff.  A lot of stuff.
Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, 'To love's eternal glory.'
Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
[Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
[retching sounds coming from the men's bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?
It's too big of a pill to swallow.
Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
I'm a little mad, that I don't get to go to the party in New York.  But that's mostly just because we get reimbursed for gas mileage.
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
I don't wanna be laid off. This is a good job for me. 'Cause I need my nights free. I'm in a band.
Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, 'dunh-duh-na-dah!' I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
Hey, so how was it? I mean��� the sex with Jan.
[looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
[Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
Are you sure? It is a big deal.
Sometimes we play 'Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?'
My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition.
Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
[runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!
Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
[singing and playing drums] Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
What am I going to do? [Refers to large pictures of Jan and Michael] I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art. [smirks]
Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
[singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
Jo, I think that I know what happened.
I wonder what I'll get. I brought my fiance.
Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
[to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar]
No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
An antacid that you only take once a week.
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
[reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
[holds up cell phone showing video of Angela talking to her cats] For a rainy day. [laughs]
It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
Don���t talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]
Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
[enters conference room and sees ping pong table] Oh, awesome! [Pam puts 'Meeting in Progress' sign on the door]
You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
One! [as he picks Angela up in the air]
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What?
So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn���t get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
Oh no, it's bad.  It's real bad.  It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
Oh, OK. What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a blonde?
Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
[chuckling] It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
Uh, Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II, [snickering] Weekend at Bernie's, Weekend at Bernie's II, and, oh, Groundhog Day.
Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
Oh, so you've been to a real luau.
[Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
No!  This is not fair!  This is my idea.  He���s trying to steal it because he���s jealous of me.
[hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside.  Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac.  And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that���s the guy that Erin���s flirting with?
I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
Well... I... Hey. You've never met me before.
Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
Never trust a cookie with a woman���s name.  Pecan Sandy.  Lorna Doone.  Madeline.  They���ll just break your heart.
Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
May he rest in pieces. [chuckles] You know, because there's, like, two pieces of him.
No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
[On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer]
No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
You know who I really like? That guy, Andy.
We're getting hungry out there.  We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat.  We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
[singing]  Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out]
Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me.
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
[running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah!
Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
And he can get any girl that he wants.
[while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
What does this mean? What does it mean!
Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen]
For Diwali 07, you must consider Scrantonicity. For a fraction of the cost of this DJ, you could have the rocking sound stylings of a Police cover band.
[Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat?
Pam! Pam, look out! Erin���s gunning for your job!
She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
Ooh, I haven���t heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
Hi, I'm Kevin. And I'll do your taxes.
Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him 'Cool Guy Paul.' W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Well, you are the one in charge of it.
Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
This is the best meeting we've ever had.
Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
Umm... I think I saw some in the kitchen. [toaster oven bell rings, Ryan opens it as smoke rolls out and he see's his melted sunglasses on the tray, Ryan takes cooked sunglasses to Kevin] Oh! I didn't do that.  That was Kevin 1.0, but he hurt a lot of people Ryan, and I can't accept responsibility for what he did. [Ryan walks away and throws his sunglasses in the trash, Kevin smiles]
I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought 'Oh, she has a new bra with padding.' But then I thought 'Pam doesn't need padding.' It just didn't add up, Jim.
no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn���t know, you didn���t know, and you didn���t freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
Don���t! oh, you must think���I���m not. I���m using the fax, this isn���t, no wait.  I���m not supposed to represent the company. Right? There���s usually an Erin here.
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face]
I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
I don't want people making fun of my weight.
I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
Jim, how long?  I have to go to the bathroom.
Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball]  Yes.  Okay, um.  I was trying to throw this party once.  And everyone was over for the weekend.  And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had  to pretend like he was alive, so...
Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... [starts breaking up] It's just nice to win one.
So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
[With his mouth full] I love this hog mama.
In every good hostage movie, during the part where it gets really tense, and you don't know whether the bad guys are going to let the hostages go free, the cops order pizza.
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
[Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
[giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
[also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises]
Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
[to camera] I might have done it with Jan!
Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
Okay.  The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
I do not want to talk about it.
I'll always remember Meredith's back.  That's all I can see from my desk.  All that red hair, over a nice strong back.  Sometimes I pretend it's Carrot Top, and he's going to turn around and tell a joke.
Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
Alright everybody, who���s in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don���t make us come over there.
Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump]
My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
[laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom!
Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
[to drummer] Dude, you're on TV! You���re the sportscaster on channel seven.
That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
[Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
[talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
Then why don't you do something about it?
I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left.  At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
[Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing]
[laughing] Se��or Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
[sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
Nice. ��Pretty soon, we���re gonna be at the ceiling.
No. That...  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
Ooh, it���s when you get a free sandwich after you���ve already eaten ten sandwiches.
Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?
[on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
[Rap music playing] [singing] The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer My name's DMC with the mike in my hand And I'm chilling and cooling just like a snow man
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
[Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.
What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
[singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
No, watching TV at work is really cool.
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good. [Oscar and Angela exit looking pleased]
Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it.
Well I can���t stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm...
Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
I���m only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers.  Not things that don���t exist like ghosts or mummies.
[on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Andy, we're fine. We don't wanna switch. We're already like, the perfect unit.
Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and g��iro]
So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
You knocked the mirror off of my car.
Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.
I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
[at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight. [snickering] Sixty-nine. Seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three.
Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling]  They see.
Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God.
[in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]
[tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
[pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
I think his characters are pretty funny. Especially Ping.
Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
[at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.
Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
