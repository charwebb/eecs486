Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.
Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?
Right here's good, sexy.  Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex.
You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?
So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?
All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants.  All right! Here we go. 
Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. 
Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a...  STRETCH.
You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!
You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?
By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.  Let's go people!  We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!
Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him.
Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?
Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.
Oh my God! This is terrible!  Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?
All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus...
All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras.  Why do we do it, Harris?
Well those aren't left hands.  See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands.
I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. 
Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!
So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?!  Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!
Little boy...  Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but...  we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.
No way! Let's just get to this, baby.
All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use.
Yeah, yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint. 
Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.
Oh my God. Murphy!  You're not gonna believe this.
There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric!  We've got a little problem.
It must be true. The kid is psychic.  But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy. 
Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?
Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.
It's Jefferson! He's back!  All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.  Whoa, wait a minute!  That guy isn't black!  Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus!  This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!  You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!
And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself. 
This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.
Stand back, give him room!  Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?
Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?
So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!
This is... where the body was found.  Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.
Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?
To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!
Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.
Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the...  FREEZE!! Ha! You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
Sorry we had to do this, but the lady principal insisted. 
Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!
This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution.  Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking.
I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force. 
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!  Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.  Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?
While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed.
We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!
Oh that's all right.  Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE!  You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma?
A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.
Excuse me!  Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?
Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr...
Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.
Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. 
I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.
Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.
I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too.
Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.
His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good.
Freeze!  You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! 
That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya!  Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE!  Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom!  Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. 
What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community!  Oh, hold on, that's my daddy.  Hey Daddy.
It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.
All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?
Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right.  Wait a minute.
You're right. We're sorry. This is serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his "Luckiest Boy In America" medal right away. 
Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.
Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?
Damnit, where were all these sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!
